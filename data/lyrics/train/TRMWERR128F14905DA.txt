Hang around on the street
Get a feel for this ugly place
Everybody wants to
Hide their face
Lonely state of mind

You will go
Just hang around
Waiting for a show
They look familiar
But no one I know
Lonely state of mind

If you will go
I'll surely be there
It's an ugly place
It's looks just like
A space I live in
We're an ugly race
Everybody wants to
Take your place

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh

All the cops
...
