[Chorus 1: Scratched Samples - w/ ad libs]
"We be goin, goin down, diggy diggy down diggy down"
"I'm a give it, as far as you can take-take it"
"Class"
"Throughout the east, south, west and the north"
"We be goin down, diggy diggy down diggy down"
"I'm a give it, as far as you can take-take-take it"
"Class"
"Once again"
[Verse 1: Classified]
Yeah, uh, they call me Class - The MC, refresh the memory
Hands in the sky, with the crowd to a frenzy
Whether it's empty or packed like Wembley
I got a track record athletes would envy
No need for jewels or a Bentley
I'm fresher than Dentyne on a ten speed, shoppin at Frenchie's (Class)
I guess you could say I've been green
Since this hemp weed, hope then condemn me
I don't want to be a God damn rock star
All strung out and beaten down like a stock car
I'll agree I'm a bit of a pessimist
Mad scientist mixed with a perfectionist
I find this rap shit acts therapeutically
