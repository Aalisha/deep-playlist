Oh, my little Philly, I'm gonna ride you
I'm gonna write you a love story
And I'll make you my very own star
And when it's cold out
I'm gonna crawl inside of you

She's my little sapphire
I'm gonna shine you, girl
I'm gonna keep you close to my heart
And they'll never tear us apart

And when it's dangerous
I'll always protect you
...
