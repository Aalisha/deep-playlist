Gentlemen where have we been
Can't find the hole where we got in
We ain't have no letters since spring
Gentlemen where have we been

We ain't going nowhere now
I'll let this bottle make its rounds
And let this liquor settle down
We ain't going nowhere now

Darker than ever in the mind
I shine a light, shine a light
Now, holler back now, make some noise
I do believe they trapped us boys
