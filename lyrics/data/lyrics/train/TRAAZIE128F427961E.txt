Ah the first summer of love was here when I was much too young
Ah the first summer of love was clearly just a summer long
And there was Jesus on the radio
Jesus on the train.
Jesus in the calico
Jesus in the rain
And there was love love love love
Anyone could see that there was love
love all over me
Ah the second summer of love is here so tell your angry friends
