"Hip Hop is a way of life
A way of life To me
Hip Hop is a way of life"
"It is the mighty" 4X
(DTFH)
Compact
We'll program the spring on contact
The real rhymes did all
While you faker than lawnmats
Perpetrating grass
With your perpetrating ass
For certain ways to gas
Tryin to escape the blast
Don't make me laugh (ha ha ha)
I'm greatly ax in it
Attack sentences
Outline the track interest is
Break barriers evade how it grabs
Like a bottle, dram of malt liquor without tall pictures
Audio visuals
You need your own picture tube
Don't matter if you're richer dude
Money can't buy it
So I guess you miss out and never get to try it
My whole click's the flyest
With appliances
Of the science of the rhymin
Ain't no one denyin' this
? Buying wigs? with my word weaponry
It's destiny
Press on me and get a lecture free of charge now
If you such a baller and you large then why you still here, huh?
Let's make this real clear
You ain't going nowhere
You're so scared to see what's outside your house
Survival of the fittest
Is easier than just easing up
But we will mix you up
