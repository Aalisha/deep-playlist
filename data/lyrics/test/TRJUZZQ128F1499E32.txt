Baby tell me why
why do you question
all this love that I have for you
if you look into my eyes
and make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
put your trust in me
allow me to be that
baby give me your hand to hold
cause the feelings that I have
are so complicated that words cannot explain there is only one who knows

Only God knows
how much I love you
God sees my heart
and that he cares about you
God knows
that i'm thinking of you
and i'm longing for you
how wish that you knew what God knows

Baby tell me what
what is the reason
one good reason you're so insecure
cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
girl im down for you and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand
