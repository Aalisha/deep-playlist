Got to get back to the well
Drink that livin? water
Dive deep in myself
Start feelin? like I oughta

Gonna get real still
Gonna get my fill
It? s been a long, dry spell
And I got to get back
I got to get back to the well

Feelin? empty for so long
Wonderin? where my faith has gone
I think about how lost I? ve been
In a search that never ends
And I? ve got to keep movin? on

Got to get back to the well
