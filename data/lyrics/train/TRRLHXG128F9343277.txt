Watching the world float on by
I can say I'm alright
Watching the sun light the moon
As the day turns to night

And he says don't you know I love you?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
He says everyday is special
You have made me believe

Hold me in your arms 'cause I'm falling
Hold me in your arms while we're sleeping
Hold me in your arms
