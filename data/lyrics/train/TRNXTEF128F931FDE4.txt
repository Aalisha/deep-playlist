It's Saturday night and my daddy's up late pickin' with my uncle Bill
The neighbors don't mind cause they have a good time sippin' on my pappy's still
Old brother Ben got a fiddle in his hands and mama's on the mandolin
When the music is right and the band is tight you wanna see 'em pick and grin
Well everybody starts movin' to the sound of the guitar strums
Everybody starts groovin' to the beat of the rhythm and drums
