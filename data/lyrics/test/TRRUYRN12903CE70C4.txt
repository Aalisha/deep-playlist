What you doing with that stupid little girl?
Stop your fooling, don't you know its gonna hurt?
When she leaves you, and you gave all you could give
You'll be hurting for the one you should be with

How are you gonna deal with this?
How many times before you slip?
You made a wager with a kiss
Now you're the new name on her lips
This is the real thing at your door
