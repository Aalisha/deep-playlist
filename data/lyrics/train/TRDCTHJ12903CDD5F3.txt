High on fire and solid confidence
Truthful rantings but no one is listening
Check collateral, sweep the corners
The fear of words in a fucked up reality

Steal my freedom of speech, my liberty
Fail my rights to express myself
All this half-lied semperfi stone-faced bullshit
Infecting me to deplete my design

I'm drowning in the fear of gods
The more I see the less I want
I was not raised to shut my mouth but as long it holds me
I will fight it
And scold it
All My life
