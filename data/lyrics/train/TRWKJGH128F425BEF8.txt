Lord of empty space
You breathe and then create
Before the earth was made
You are

The king of every age
Outside of time and space
The heavens speak Your name
You are
You are, yeah

Lord of brilliant light
You separate the night
And everything inside
You are

The one who calms the seas
And every part of me
With just a word you speak
You are
You are
