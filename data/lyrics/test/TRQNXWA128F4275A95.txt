A shooting star fell down to earth
Lightning cracked the sky
Something weird is happening
Something I can't deny

A strange kind of magic
Running through my brain
Feel I'm in heaven
Or going insane

'Cause everytime we touch
I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss
I swear, I could fly

Can't you hear my heart beat fast
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch
I feel the static
And everytime we kiss
I reach for the sky

Can't you hear my heart beat so
I can't let you go
Want you in my life
...
