One, two, one, two, three
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah
Do do do do

Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
I found your address got your phone number too
Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
Been to secret places you think nobody knows

If I have to breathe without you
Nobody could
I need to be around you
Watchin' you

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you
Creepin' up on you

I been hangin' round all the places you haunt
Spyin' on your friends to find out what you want
Drinkin' from the glass that you left on the bar
Follow you around drivin' home in your car
