L.A. girl, take one

We don't care, you say we're too young
Waste our time tanning in the sun
We don't care what you know or think
Spoiled rich brat you ain't so neat

L.A. girl, L.A. world
Don't tell us how to act, don't tell us what to wear
L.A. girl, L.A. world
You didn't create our scene

We don't care
We can't see why
We don't live our lives
