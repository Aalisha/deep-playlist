I need a meaning, I need a soul
This circle is vicious but precious like gold
Don't push the river, don't stop the flow
Dead in the water, caught in the undertow

You are the ocean, I am a wave
Fell out of motion, I lost my way
You are the ocean, I am a wave
I fell out of motion

And I learned a lesson, I learned it so well
I won't forget it, I've got a truth to tell
My last confession, my faith was long dead
I pushed the river was more that I could bear

You are the ocean, I am a wave
