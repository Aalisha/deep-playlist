(J. Jett/R. Browde/R. Byrd/K. Laguna)

Standing on the corner trying to hail a cab
You tap me on the shoulder
My heart about to stop it was fine
You ask me for directions you was going my way
I had no objections I couldn't be blas√©
You were fine

The move was so electric
You were so magnetic
Just like in the movies
Just like in the movies

Thursday at the Plaza, Friday at the Ritz
You were all I wanted and we seal it with a kiss
