Well, all my friends are boppin' the blues
It must be goin' 'round
All my friends are boppin' the blues
And it must be goin' 'round
I love you, baby but I must be rhythm bound

Well, the doctor told me
Boy, you don't need no pills
Yeah, that doctor told me
Son, you don't need no pills
Just a handful of nickels
And a jukebox will cure your ills
