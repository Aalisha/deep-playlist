(You can get what you want)
I want my love to paint pretty pictures for me
(You can get what you wish for)
Technicolor and super-reality
(You can get what you need)
I need my life to be extraordinary
(You can get what you push for)

Ram Slam
Wooah

You're a work of pop art
Wanna hang you on the wall
You're funky dory baby
Baby, that's all
You're a work of pop art
Wanna hang you on the wall
You're funky dory baby
Baby, that's all
Baby, that's all

(You can get what you want)
A super hero who isn't stronger than me
