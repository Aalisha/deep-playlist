Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Big man is back, oh no, it's a brand new flow
Lettin' you Jakes and females know
Ain't a damn thing changed and I still got dough
Still gettin' watched by Po-Po

You know what a flow like, never grab a ol' mic
Never been down wit the slow life
Baby, I'm a low life, lookin' for the right type
To get it goin' on for the whole night

King of the backside, look at my rep
One of these West Coast veterans
Known to lay bone and make miniskirts moan
Young hotty got me sittin' like stone

So, I'm at the Magic City
So many freaks in one spot, I'm dizzy
I'm a playa, so you know I wanna play
It ain't nuthin' like the city Blacklanta, GA

Now, I start lookin' through the mist
Swangin' my game like this
Wassup wit the table poppin'?
