When will you make up your mind?
When will you make up your mind?

Darling just be yourself tonight
There's nothing wrong with the way you feel
The moon and stars are in the sky
We're centuries apart and the lights are shining down on you
(I can't stand it)

Aah, conditioned soul
(I can't stand it)
When will you make up your mind?
When will you make up your mind?
(I can't stand it)
