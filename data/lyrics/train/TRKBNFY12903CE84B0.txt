I was just thinkin' about you
Thought I could call you, see if I should tell you
That I've never had such a feelin', there's this
How much better can all this get?

I'm ten feet off off the ground
And still looking down

And I've waited forever to know
How deep down my love will go
And no matter how long I try to get it
It's the one thing that I'll never finish

Today is just another day
