I used to see light in your eyes
But I don't see it anymore
And all those promises you made to me
I don't need them anymore

I used to waste hours in bed
And I came too close to follow
Follow you down

I used to phone you thousands of times
But now you never seem to call
And all the songs that I sung to you
I don't sing them anymore

I used to waste hours in bed
And I came too close to follow
Follow you down

And I'm leaving 'cause I'm all over you
And I'm leaving 'cause I'm all over you
And I'm leaving 'cause I'm all over you

And do you think that's fine
...
