You never listen to me, 
you cannot look me in the eyes
And I have struggled to see, 
why it's so easy to push me aside
I no longer believe 
that you were ever at my side
How could you know what I need 
when I am the last thing on your mind?

Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you

So disconnected, go through the motions again
So disconnected, everything goes over your head
So disconnected, you got me hanging by a thread
So disconnected, when will this cycle end?
