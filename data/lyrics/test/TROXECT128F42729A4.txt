If you want my glory you gotta take my sin
If you want my future you gotta take my skin
If you want my heart you gotta take my blood
If you want my bed you gotta take my lust

(chorus)
â€˜Cause I'm not a half a man
I'm not a half a man
Lord knows I love you now
but a saint and a sinner is what I am
