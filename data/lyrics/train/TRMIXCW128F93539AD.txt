My baby she loves me so
My little baby she never tells me no
My sweet baby never gonna let her go
Not today, anyway

You know my honey she comforts me
My little honey crumpets with my tea
In the morning it just happens to be
That I've fallen in love
Least I think it's love

Since you're new and your eyes are blue
I think I'll show you around the block
There's a little place called The Step Thirteen
And, man does that old joint rock
