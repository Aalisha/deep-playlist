Just for now (x6)

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know?
It's what I always wanted
You can never have had too many of these
Will ya quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her
Shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?
