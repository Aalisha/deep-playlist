TRAITOR DONT YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON ME
TRAITOR DONT YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME
I WILL BREAK YOU
WATCH YOUR ENTIRE WORLD CRUMBLE
I WILL DROP YOU
WATCH YOUR ENTIRE WORLD FALL

turn your back look away lost at false security i trust you wont be so CORRUPTED throwing the dirt in ur face did u mean to steal the day edens apple was the LAST MISTAKE BY YOU

my mind is all but gone
YOU CANT REPLACE YOUR DIGNITY
our bond is all but gone
