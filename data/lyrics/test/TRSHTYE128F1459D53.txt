I don't want to talk to nobody
Don't want to make no plans
I'm so tired of this party
I've had all my laughs
I'll send you somethin' when I cross over
Somethin' when I cross over
I'll send you somethin' when I cross over
When I'm where I'm goin'
I get in a good mood just thinkin' 'bout
All those streets I've never seen
Nobody askin' me for nothin'
