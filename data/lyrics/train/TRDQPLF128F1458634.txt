Good sister, won't you let me in?
I'm in need of some warmth and shelter.
It's a hard luck story, don't know where to begin.
I've been riding on life's helter-skelter.

Save me, Holy Mother, please, save me!
I got a heart of gold.

And for your love I'd go hungry and thirsty.
I need a saviour and you're the one.
I throw myself into the arms of mercy.
There's still hope for the runaway son.
