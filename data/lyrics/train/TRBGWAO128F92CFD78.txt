Tell me all of your secrets tonight,
Meet me on the corner at nine,
It's a hard way to fall, and such a long way down

I wonder when I see you again,
If you'll even feel like a friend,
It's the wrong name to call,
And such an easy way out

I put my money down on the table,
I'll try to walk away if I'm able,
...
