One! Get off your seat!
Two! Stomp your boots to the beat!
Three! Throw your knees in the air!
Four! Like you don't care!

We don't want to see you slammin' in the pit, NO!
We don't want to see our girlfriends kicked, NO!
We just want to see you movin' faster and faster,
to the beat of the super ska master.
Phonys like to slam to the beat of ska,
we're not against that, but for us there's more.
To dance with us you needn't act like a jerk,
skankin's meant for fun, not for getting hurt!

Skankin' by numbers every night and day,
skankin' by numbers is the only way,
get off your seat and take a chance.
