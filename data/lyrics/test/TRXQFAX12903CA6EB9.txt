Old man looks much younger now
He lost his strength, respect somehow
Look in the mirror at what I found
It's just the past and it's over now

Ooh, it's over now
Ooh, it's over now

My heart's like a wheel
Head's just a stone
I got my memories
Ain't got no home

(Fallin')
Ooh, Fallin' Apart At The Seams
(Fallin')
Ooh, yeah, Fallin' Apart At The Seams
