Yeah, yeah, yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey

See the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell the way they have to mention
How they've helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr Intentional

All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity, to further situation

Why they so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr Intentional
Oh, oh, oh oh

We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
