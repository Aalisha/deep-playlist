We always hurt the ones we love,
that's a fact
which we can't deny.
We never talk instead we shoot,
that's how we learned it from TV.
We're drifting apart.

And she will be
my death.

Like on the battlefield,
she's got her weapons armed.
And she will always be
my beloved enemy.
I don't know what to do,
I feel so helpless now,
I want to kiss or kill
my beloved enemy.

I never said how much I loved you,
...
