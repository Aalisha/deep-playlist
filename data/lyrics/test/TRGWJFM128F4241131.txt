Neptune is my king again
His song in the sea...

You're not gonna loosen me are you?
You tied me to your love again
As long as there's heaven I will rescue
I need to bring you back again
You say you are willing sometimes
Now I feel more alive
You cannot be loosenin' me, baby
I only wanted this much
