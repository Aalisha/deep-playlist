Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
