Time, the future's in my mind, I know the game
I can feel the power of the night, a big desire

Time, emotion in my eyes, you know my game
I can't leave without my love tonight, I'm crazy

Why, in the middle of the night
I call your name
Save my heart, it's beatin' fast
My love is ready all the time

Stay, forever my game is good to play
Incredible story if you
Stay, I need you today
My heart is on fire, please don't leave
This way

Stay, whenever you want to feel the same
Forever I need you if you
Stay, my heart is okay
Together we'll spend our life forever more
