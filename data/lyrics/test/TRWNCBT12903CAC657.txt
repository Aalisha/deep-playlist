First time when you looked at me
You tried to hide but I could see
A special beauty in your eyes
Passion flying like a spark
Like an arrow to the mark
I feel it sting my jealousy

Before you know there's footprints in the snow

Desire like a river flows
Where it comes from no one knows
Love just like a flower grows
And then God only knows
It comes down like guillotine
