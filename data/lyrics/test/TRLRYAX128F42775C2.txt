Life is cruel and then you die
Can't be bothered to try to survive
Time will stop the hours fly
I watch my life slipping by

They call it news it's not to me
The worlds a mess on my TV
I cannot speak I cannot feel
Everything is nothing to me

There's no music on my radio
There's no music on my radio
There's no music on my radio
There's no music on my radio

There's nothing bright to light my day
No signs to read to show me the way
I can't escape I'm out of luck
A bad day I've had enough
