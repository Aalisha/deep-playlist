[Bun B]
When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't movin keys I barely movin dimes
Started comin up fiends recognize my face
Started payin off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You wanna freebase I got them hovers for your ass
You get high as a kite and you feel a megablast
Cash movin stacks, then they came to piles
And then them fiends started hittin crack viles

[Pimp C]
Back in the days they used to run up sayin Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuckawayfrommehoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, but you can't change they ass I guess
Take a Brilo pad to the chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones

[Chorus:]

I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
I gotta pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone

[Pimp C]
