Do do do do do do do do ...
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time a way

And talk about their homes
There's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whisky and wine

The sailors say...
Brandy, you're a fine girl
(you're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
...
