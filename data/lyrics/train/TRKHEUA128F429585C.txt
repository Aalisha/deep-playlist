Maybe you're just jaded
From some nobody's unforgotten words
Maybe you're just faded
A little gray from every time that you've been hurt

So you're lookin' for your skin
That you never did fit in
You can't hide when you're turned inside out
Love is looking for you now

Maybe you been burnin'
But you can't blow out a flame that you can't find
...
