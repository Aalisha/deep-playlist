This is the story of my life
This is what I go through
On an everyday basis
Just trying to live

Lay your head on my shoulder
Everything is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you cry
Don't you worry bout a thing
I see a rainbow at the end
It's gonna be alright

So many problems around me
Dammit won't they just go away
Every night I pray, yea
Lord won't you come my way
Won't you come and rescue me
Help me see the light

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
