Could be tomorrow, could be today
(It’s gonna be a tragedy)
A chill in the wind and it’s blowing our way
(It’s gonna be a tragedy)
Sooner or later there’ll come a time
(It’s gonna be a tragedy)
That cold wind will blow and you know that’s a crime

Tragedy is on the rise
Tragedy before your eyes
Tragedy for everything
Tragedy, if we don’t give a damn
