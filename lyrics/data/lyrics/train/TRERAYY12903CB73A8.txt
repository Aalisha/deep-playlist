So he tried to put the fire out
But you used gasoline
When the congregation gathered around
You screamin' "it wasn't me,"
So there is a sickness that's going around
But no one's got a vaccine
I think it drowned in holy water
I think it's time we all come clean

I swear it's like dying
To catch a ghost
