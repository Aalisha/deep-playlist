My coffee is cold, and yesterday is stuck with me
And I can't wake up from my sleep
I feel like a grain of salt in the shaker but the day that I meet my maker or
The day that I see my undertaker, ya see...

All I have is too many questions
Is there something someone forgot to mention to me
But I walk on with out hesitation
To my unknown own destination
With the music like syncopation
And explore my own imagi... nation.


How do I know if I am right in why I feel like I do.
And separate the truth from the lies
And why do we only take any action when it comes to our satisfaction
