Let me out
Good girl let me out
Good girl let me out of the grey city, concrete so cold
Where everybody's got something to sell
Let me out from this place where the young seem too old
And everybody's crawling into their shell
Let me out

Let me in
Good girl let me in
Good girl let me into a world where the hates turning dry
And there's more common sence in the air
Let me into a place where there's no help to lie
...
