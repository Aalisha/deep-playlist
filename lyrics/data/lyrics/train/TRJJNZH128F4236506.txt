Around it comes and round it goes
Around it swims around my head
All of us are lonley souls
And all of get left for dead

How come I always try to cross
Even though I know the bridge is burning?
How come I take it
When I know that you fake it?
I tell myself I'm learning

The lies that I believe are simple
The lies that I believe are true
The lies that I believe are so beautiful
