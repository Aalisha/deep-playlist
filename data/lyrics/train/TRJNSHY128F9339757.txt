She blew a good thing,
She blew a good thing,
Now if a little girl there should doubt me,
Tell her I'm gonna wait.
And if she asks ya why,
Tell her that I,
Left her 'cause she didn't realize,
That she coulda had a love,
Hotter than fire, oh yeah.
She coulda had a heart,
Beating with desire.
She coulda had a love,
Hotter than fire...
A heart,
Beating with desire.
She blew a good thing,
She blew a good thing,
(She blew a good thing)
(She blew a good thing)
...
