Rest inside
I think we're safe tonight
When coming down
You are so weird
When you're raising hell
For yourself
I know
You have not withered yet
We have this time to cultivate

And I'm alive
once again
when you take your knife
Off, off my skin
we are the same
and the light will come and save us all
No more fear
...
