You called me from the office to say you're working late
Well I admire your dedication but where's the extra pay?
I meet you at the front door with wine on your breath
I couldn't help but notice there's a button off your dress
Say you and your girlfriends just stopped to eat a bite
Well I was born in the dark but it wasn't last night

Friday I came home and you was lookin fit to kill
Said you're going to your sisters cause your sisters feeling ill
I called her house all weekend just to see if she was fine
I never got an answer musta called a hundred times
