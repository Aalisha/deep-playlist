Hey mister didn't mean to be so stupid
And I confess I stole your heart from your chest
And if I yeah and if I had the chance
I'd put it back somehow
Yeah I'd do it

Hey missus you yell amazing contributions
You know that I don't mind I'm not listening
Know that if I know that if I had to light myself on fire
I'd do it
Yeah I'd do it somehow

Don't you dare shove me away
Look over your shoulder
Cause I'm coming over

Don't you dare shove me away
