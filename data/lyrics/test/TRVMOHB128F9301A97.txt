Make me the captain of your Pirate Ship
Paint all the clouds the colour of no
Drift on the warm wind of your secret world
Hang on to your Starstream
Make the sun reappear
Make the dark disappear
From my night sky
Fly away
Fly away

Carry me, carry me
Carry me, carry me

Show me your island of a thousand names
Washed by the tide of time gone by
