From birth an existence of agony begins that ends with execution.
Intetionally infected with diseases to then
Try to find cures for humans. Fractured skulls,
Broken bones, scalded flesh and blinded eyes. For medical research and

Walls conceal the tortured victims of vivisection.
Nothing of value can be gained
For science or medicine when the price is a helpless animal's life.
An animal becomes a subject - their pain a mere reaction.
