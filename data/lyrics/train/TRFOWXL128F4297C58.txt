She's a liar - and she's a crier
She's a dumb little girl
Who pushes to get higher

She's a teaser - and she's a squeezer
You gotta get away from her
'Cause she's a cheater

Don't wanna be loved by you
(Loved by you...)
She has made your brown eyes blue
(Brown eyes blue...)
Gotta leave her alone 'cause she's a liar
Baby she's a liar!
Don't let her get down on you
(Down on you...)
Don't let her pull tricks on you
(Tricks on you...)
She's a girl who likes to play with fire...

She's a dreamer - and she's a screamer
She's not the kind of girl
Like people see her

She's a looser - and she's a boozer
She likes to get it done her way
So she can use ya

Don't wanna be loved by you
...
