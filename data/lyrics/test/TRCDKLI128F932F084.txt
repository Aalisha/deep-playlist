How about the possibility of you and I
Lady can we try
Lady say you're wit it
If you're not wit it, get it 'scuse me

Can't make you stay
If you want to go
Sugar I can't make you love me
If you're heart says no
There's one thing I'm certain of
And I know it's true
Can't nobody does it like I do like I do

Hey excuse me please
You sure look good to me
With your straight hair up braids
Kinda got my momma's waves (kinda got my momma's waves)
How about the possibility of you and I
Lady can we try
Lady say you're wit it
If you're not wit it, get it 'scuse me

The first time I saw your thighs
That's when I realized
My heart - it skipped a beat
