Sleeping beauty
Where have you been
You should know
I´m counting on you here

Feels like clouds beneath your wings
It is night, you see it as it is
It is dark, have mercy on us all
You should know
I´m counting on you here

His kiss
His kiss
His kiss
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss of spring
His kiss...

Let´s talk about the weather
And the snow
Falling from the heavens like crystal feather
The power of the powder
The silence screams louder
I feel cold
This is a nation on hold
...
