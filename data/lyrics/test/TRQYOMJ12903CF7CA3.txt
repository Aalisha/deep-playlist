The river rolls and the river winds
And it seems to do something for my peace of mind
Though I didn't know it, I came here looking to find
A place to forget about my troubles for awhile

I saw a mother with her little baby when I was walking here
There's something 'bout a little baby that makes me laugh
They don't seem to have a care
And I wonder if I'm ever gonna feel that way again

Until then, I'll find some time to spend down by the river
