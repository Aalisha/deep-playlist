Don't know if I'm right
But I'm not wrong, just now
Don't know what makes you think I'm so strong
Somehow
It's in keeping
With my not sleeping around

You keep thinking I'm tired of you
But I'm just tired
While I keep saying you're sick of me
But you're just sick
It's in keeping
With your not sleeping around
