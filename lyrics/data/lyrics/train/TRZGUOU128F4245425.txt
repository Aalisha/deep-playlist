Turn it up!
yeah!
i'm working hard, you're working too
we do it every day
for every minute i have to work
i need a minute of play
day in day out all week long
things go better with rock
the only time i turn it down
is when i'm sleepin it off
Turn up the radio
i need the music, gimmie some more
turn up the radio
i wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
Now listen!
i wanna shake, i wanna dance
so count it off a'one two three
i feel the beat, i'm in a trance
