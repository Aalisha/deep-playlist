Too many words on the the tip of my tongue and
I can never figure out
When to speak when to shout when to shut up
When to knock myself out

I need a brainwash
Gray-matter bath
I need the clutter all
Thrown in the trash
I need a brain wash cause I'm aloon


So could ya please throw my head in a tub?
I could really use a cereberal scrub
...
