In no time
you'll be fine
Don't worry...

Don't worry...
Don't worry...

You met a guy you said he was your lover
he said he loved you like no other
told you that you were the only one
how could he say that when he's having so much fun

now he says you're making him sad
how he says that when he treats you so bad
now he's gone left you for another
you're not the first you now discover

Don't you cry - you'll get by - you'll be back
on your feet - in no time - you'll be fine - don't worry
you got hurt - you got hurt - you're not the first
...
