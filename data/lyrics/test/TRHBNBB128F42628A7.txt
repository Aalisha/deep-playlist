Yonder mountain so high
I can't make it all on my own, no
Rolling river why so wide?
To sweep me up and to bear me on
Up against the sky so bright
That I can't even close my eyes

I know I will follow (Follow love)
Yes, yes, I will follow (Follow love)
I will follow (Follow love)
Follow love

Growing slowly like a tree
Someday soon, darling I love you
I love you
Soft and gentle, full Summer moon
Set my soul free
Thank you, baby
