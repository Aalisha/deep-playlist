You're lokin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
You're sayin' not quite enough to me
You're sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt you're playin' real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin' (trippin') a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me!

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
we can ohhohhh, get right
We can ohhhhhh, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up
We can right, get right, tonight
We can tonight

Your lips talkin' about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh so slow (so slow)
Bar tab lookin' like a car note (car note)
All I need is you here right by my side
