[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah... R.A.Z.A.H.*
Do the Grey Goose dance, baby
Yo, run to the bar real quick
Everybody put they glass in the air...
Drink with me, uh-huh, we gon' smoke tonight
And probably fuck up ya hair, baby
I want two ladies to one nigga, right now
What it take you a week, I do in one take, let's go

[Hell Razah:]
This for the mami's with the gorgeous bodies, who barely go to parties
My sweet lion is love, from out the wild safari
And we can never copy, Whitney or being Bobby
Parking lot pimping, here's a hard Ferrari
She like Jamaican sands, tanning to Bob Marley
I'm into old jams, but I ain't Steve Harvey
I'm more like, probably, a young Marcus Garvey
I respect queens, don't disrespect the hotties
My independent ladies, single and got babies
Keeping they legs closed, while brothers in the Navy
And brothers locked up, around the late eighties
Ain't coming home soon, could make a switch move
Catch a full moon, bitchy attitude
The way the booty move, could make the wise fooled
She got a mind brighter, than any prized jewel
