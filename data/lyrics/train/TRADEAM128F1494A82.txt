Your chauffeur-driver man
Only got one hand
That he steers around the visions
You think that your command

On your patch of ground
Small hyenas prowl
It is just expedience
That keeps the sun going
round and round

Little sweet hyenas
Conveniently tame
Bittersweet hyenas
Never far away

Love leaves you alone
then pain will come for sure
When your friends and foes will tell ya
You ain't dangerous no more
...
