There is nothing in my head today
Nothing awful there to ponder or confuse me
Go ahead in what you have to say
And I will listen as I listen to the news

I know the whole truth there is horrible
It's better if you take a little at a time
Too much and you are not portable
Not enough and you'll be making happy rhymes
