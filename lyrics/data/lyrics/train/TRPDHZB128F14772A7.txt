In the morning when I wake I'm so thankful for another day
And I wanna testify.
Got a job a roof overhead don't live fancy but my family's fed
I wanna testify.
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that
with fame or wealth And
I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me
...
