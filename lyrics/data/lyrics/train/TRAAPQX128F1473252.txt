I got no sense of time
The second hand slaps
Me, oh, so silly

And insults my character now
For I like my
Mood to lead me

I walk into your room
Prepared with reasons why I can't join
You for this whole afternoon

I just got one day
Of writing it all down
And oh, so here I go

I must seize all my time by
Grabbing this old clock setter
By his bald gray forelock

All wasted on the job
My life span quickly shortening
...
