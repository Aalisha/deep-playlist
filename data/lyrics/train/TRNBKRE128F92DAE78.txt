Feeling the way I do, it's hard to keep focus
One minute staring at the moon, next into your eyes
And it's no surprise that my knees weaken
At the lovely words you're speaking

It takes more than diamonds to woo me
La la la
It takes more than money to groove me

Feeling the way I do, it's hard to keep focus
One minute staring at the moon, next into your eyes
And it's no surprise that my knees get weaken
From the lovely words you're speaking

La la la
