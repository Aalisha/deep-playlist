Wake up my lover, shake her off like a stick
Hung over, tired and shaky, head two feet thick
Half past noon I got up out of bed
Ran to the freezer to cool off my head

Now I see the vision, seeing is believing
Teas'n, pleas'n, run for the door
Teas'n, pleas'n but she wants more

Woke up again in a stranger's bed
Heard her honey's voice, I knew I was dead
Lovers under the covers, shakin' in shock
Blink of my eyes, been stabbed, hung or shot, yeah
