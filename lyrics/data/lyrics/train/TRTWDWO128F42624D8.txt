(Kevin Brandt)

My baby knows me better than I do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her here beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand

Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true pure undying love of a woman
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
