Stronger than reason, stronger than lies
The only truth I know is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes

Just like a car crash, just like a knife
My favorite weapon is the look in your eyes
You've run out of lies

You've run out of lies, you've run out of lies
You've run out of lies, you've run out of lies
