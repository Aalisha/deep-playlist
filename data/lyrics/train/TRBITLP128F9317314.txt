Baby, I was hypnotised when I looked into your eyes
Saw the love I'd been waiting for
Couldn't help but fantasise 'bout a world where you and I
Stay together for evermore

Don't hesitate
'Cause I can't control my feelings
Just can't wait
Now I know where this is leading

Baby, please
This heart's on the line
Don't waste this precious time
Say you'll be mine
It's not hard to do
Just tell me you feel it too
Baby, it's time
Say you'll be mine
(Say you'll be mine)

Took a spark to start the fire, fan the flame of my desire (my desire)
Turn the light on my destiny
And it took me by surprise all the love I felt inside (felt
Now I know it was meant to be

And step by step
I can feel how close we're getting
