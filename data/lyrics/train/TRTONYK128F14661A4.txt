(I got something for you, man)
(Go for a ride)

Bombarded by philosophies that satisfy the surface
I flee to something deeper
At the risk of seeking purpose
How can I hang in this environmental state of being
When everything I'm striving for
Is nothing that I'm seeing

(chorus 1)
Won't You take my heart, won't You take my soul
Won't You come and make me whole again
You, You've got what I need and You never retreat
Unto You I will concede

(chorus 2)
So help me God
To put my faith in You
So help me God
