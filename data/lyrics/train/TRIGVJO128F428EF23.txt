Say a little prayer for you'
Say a little prayer for you
Well, I remember when
You were my only friend
You took the time
When on one else cared
You gave love endlessly
And then you proved to me
No matter what
You'd always be there
And now I understand
Just how life's little plan
Can make it rough to say 'forever'
But you've been there for me
So that's my guarantee
That we will always be together
When I have sleepless nights
That's when you hold me tight
You do it right
I say a little prayer for you
And when my dreams are through
I only think of you
...
