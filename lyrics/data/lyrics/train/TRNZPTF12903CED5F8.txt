Can anybody tell me why
I feel like I just lost control?
And I can't get it back
No matter how hard I try

There's not a way to say goodbye
And I don't even know if I wanna go
It would be lying if we didn't say
Then something just don't feel right

Well, we keep talking and talking
Though nothing else seems to come out of it
And I know that I can make you see the way I feel

But now my heart is broken
And I just can't make any sense of it
All I know is you're everything that's real, ohh

This ain't the way that it supposed to be
When you're in love
You got me stuck here on the ground

Everything feels heavy
And I can't carry the weight for the both of us
The gravity is holding me down

I can't move, oh
'Cause gravity is holding me down
I don't know how
But your gravity is holding me down
