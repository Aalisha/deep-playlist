With all my heart, I love you baby.
Stay with me, and you will see my arms will hold you, baby.
Never leave, 'cause I believe I'm in love.

Sweet love hear me callin' out your name.
I feel no shame; I'm in love.
Sweet love, don't you ever go away.
It'll always be this way.

Your heart has called me closer to you.
I will be all that you need.
Just trust in what we're feeling.
