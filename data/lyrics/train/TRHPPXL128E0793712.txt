This feels like Paradise
We'll be in Heaven tonight
Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go, hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real

I wanna take everything I can steal

Love on the line, it's now or never
Why can't the night last forever?
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
