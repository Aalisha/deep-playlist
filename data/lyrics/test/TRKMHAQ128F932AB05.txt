(Go) get your ribbon box
(Go) get your wounded heart
Seeing spiders, I'm told they never lie.

(Go) get your brother love
(Go) get your losing head
Seeing fire, I'm told it never burns.

I want it all, I pull you back.
I want it all.

Cry baby, cry baby, cry.
Soaking down your...
Cry baby, cry baby,
and you can't understand how I could just kill a man.
