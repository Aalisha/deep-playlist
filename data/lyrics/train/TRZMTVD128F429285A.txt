Every night, a fleeting glimpse of candlelight
Chases cross the atmosphere but you're not here
And I see the shape of moonlight on the cityscape
But now the skyline wears a shroud
I see your voice in every crowd

Listening for your footsteps in every hallway
Watching for your headlights around the bend
I can see you standing in every doorway

Out in the street, in every glance
I see your reflection, I fall in a trance
Can't you see what I've become?
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone

Day by day, I watch the moment slip away
