Stay tonight
Let me hold you like I never did before
Take my arms
And let me hold you like I never did before
And I should have tried just to talk about this
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know that I'm
Still here
So before you let me go...

Take my hands
Let me touch you like I never did before
Take my heart and let me love you
Like I never did before
Like I never did before

And I should have tried just to talk about it
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here

But we waste it every time
...
