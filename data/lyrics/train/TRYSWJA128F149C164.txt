In the middle of winter
The trees are bare and the bears are hibernating
The only sound in the forest
Is the sound of snow heard crashing to the ground 
And in the middle of loving
I hope you'll find a place in your heart for them
They really can't do us any harm
It is only us who can do harm to them
...
