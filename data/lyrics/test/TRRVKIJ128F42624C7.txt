It's a fact, love is a gamble
It's a fact, love is a gamble
Maybe I got it too much
Maybe I got it inside
And if you've got love together
Well that's alright with me
The more that they write about it
I'm gonna mend this song of life
I've got the nerve to sing about it
I never joke and never ask why
So maybe we go together
Maybe I hear it fast
Maybe I get the message
Maybe I see it last
It's a fact, love is a gamble
It's a fact, love is a gamble
