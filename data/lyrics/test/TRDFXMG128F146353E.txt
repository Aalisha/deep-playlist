Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problems might be
Come and get with me
And get it off your chest

Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin' with a smile
Let me make you feel so right!

Wazzup ma, how you doin'?
24 in the waist; that's how you do it?
Rockin' them sell with the waistline low
The kind I like, that let the crack show
I ain't neva' did shit but rob a pocket for a ho
Between me and you, this shit's gettin' old
I could see me and you, in this grill,
Or ridin' shotgun while you whippin' the wheel

Come take a trip
With your boy Unk, I want what you want
Don't be talking about what you don't
Open that bottle; shots of patron
Let's get it on
Foreplay my way and she bumpin' my song
5 in the morn'
She holla' one more round before lickin' my cone

Y-E-S
I could take away your stress
I say Y-E-S
