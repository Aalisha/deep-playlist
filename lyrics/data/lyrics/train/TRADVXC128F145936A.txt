(Shel Silverstein/D. Loccorriere)

Lately, I've been givin' everything I've got to feeling alone
Baby you got me livin' one of them hard luck songs on the radio
Oh and I know, if I change the station I'll get the same song
Hope it ain't on the top too long

'Cause I really couldn't take it but they kept on playin' it
It's too unhappy and too close to home
I don't want to hear it but the singer keeps singin' that song

I gave you my love, you denied it
Then I gave you my life, but you wouldn't stay
