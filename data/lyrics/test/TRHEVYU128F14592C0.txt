For years I've seen you fighting
Against your heart
Living like you're dying
So far from the sun

Waiting for a guardian angel
To lead you through the dangers
That lie ahead on your way
Towards tomorrows arms

Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
You're hiding yourself away
From our cruel world's embrace
And as your days turn to weeks
...
