I don't think that we'll last as burns
But as brigands we can give it a try
Trudging through life's distraction
Here's to some mud in your eyes
Meander in a three dimensional world
In a salad bowl of racial genes
She's knitting my doom with a hook for a hand
And a smirk that's so pristine
Dirt thick as cake batter
Covering wounds and skin
Mother Mary our common thread
And next of kin
Wake up quick
Wake up sick
Bandit bandit
On easy street
...
