featuring Starr

[Starr]
I'll keep, holding on
I'll keep, holding on!

[Lord Jamar]
Young black male, twenty-five years of age
Many-a-lives didn't survive to this stage
Cause the rage of another brother got him popped
Shot him and he dropped, like a beanbag
Mean motherfucker with a rag and some jeans that sag
They signify your death by crossin out your tag
Then they go and brag that they took another life
Never to think, do a brother got a mother and a wife?
Trife when a nigga do the work of the Klan
That's what you're doin when you ruin the life of a black man
Attack plan on self
The man's got the family jewels, so I guess we're buryin wealth
All because we've been taught to despise what's black
Open your eyes you oughta realize the fact
That you've been gettin used like a trick
You think you're mighty, but yo, whitey got your head sick
See you were fed thick pieces of swine as a baby

It only help to drive your mind crazy
Now your blind days be over
No more standin on line, tryin to find Jehovah
Let us rewind to a time we was right and just
Nowadays we just fight and bust
