20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, oh
i wanna be sedated

just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
hurry, hurry, hurry before i go insane
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my brain
oh no, oh no, oh no

20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, oh
i wanna be sedated
