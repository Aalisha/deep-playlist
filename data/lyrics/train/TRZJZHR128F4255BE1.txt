How are things on the West Coast?
I hear you movin' real fine.
You wear those shoes like a dove.
Now strut those shoes, we'll go roaming in the night.

Well, how are things on the West Coast?
You keep it movin' to your soul's delight.
Now, I've tried the brakes.
I've tried but you know it's a lonely ride.

How are things on the West Coast?
Oh, and move heaven behind those eyes.

Today my heart swings.
Yeah, today my heart swings.

But I don't want to take your heart,
and I don't want a piece of history.
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore.
My God.
