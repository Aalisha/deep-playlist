You belong to this time as much as me
The world turns around in an ages old dance
Please tell me why the changes are so deep
As men are now shadows of long gone dreams
Fear lives in the eyes of thousands
As the day becomes night like in a glimpse
Silent voices don't pray anymore
As no one listens out there, now we know
Am I the only one?
I need to know who will stand beside me
