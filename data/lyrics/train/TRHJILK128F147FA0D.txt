So this is the time when
You be what you just wanna be
I always thought this would
Come oh so naturally

I'm gonna do just what you order me to do
So chase me chase me,
I'll run twelve circles around you

I'll make this way worse than you know

Ain't it a shame that they won't remember all of this

Lets get lets get it goin'
