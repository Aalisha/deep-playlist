Diddle you tell me you love me,
diddle I act like a fool.
Love was a standing ovation,
I kept on breaking the rules.

Diddle you tell me you love me,
diddle you ask me to stay.
Love had to be where I'm at,
but I turned my back as a rule.

Without you, baby what can I do,
without you, baby I feel blue.

Diddle you tell me you love me,
diddle I make you feel sad.
