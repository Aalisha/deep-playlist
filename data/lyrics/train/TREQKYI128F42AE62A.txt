Get up 'outta' your rockin' chair grandma!
Or rather would you care to dance grandmother?

Hey you! Give up to the ghost
That's haunting you now
Shout it out
Don't let it stay inside
And eat you alive
Make up your mind
Don't you want to stay
This side of the line
I can assure you
When you're my age
You'll learn
From all you've left behind
...
