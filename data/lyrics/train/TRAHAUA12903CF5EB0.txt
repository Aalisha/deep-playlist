As I crawl through the mud I felt this aim of blood, the old taste of blood screaming inside me.
Longing to awake me, telling me to take it, to make them bleed, to rape their souls I take your flesh, I take your soul, I show you your god.
My hatred grows, I feel what you feel, He is inside you, playing with you, eating - from the inside.
... and I used my knife to cut my own flesh, I wanted to feel what they were about to feel.
