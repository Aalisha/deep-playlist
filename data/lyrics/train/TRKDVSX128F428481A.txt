I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
I'm getting to like this feeling I've found
I'm getting to love the thought of having you around
And I will never let you down

They played with your emotions, dismiss the notion

Cause people don't take chances with their hearts
Since I met you I am past the hardest part
So remember one thing, I will never let you down

I'm trying to keep my feet on the ground
