Feeling low
I guess it's just my luck to be this way
Do you really have to go?
When girl you know I still want you to stay
I've been a fool
Spending my nights in bars and having fun
And leaving you home alone
When I should have been there getting my homework done.
()
Do you really mean goodbye?
I can see it now
