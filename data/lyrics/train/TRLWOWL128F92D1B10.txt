In the night, when a mist of sleep surrounds me
You come to me and hold me tight, winding your body all around me
And everywhere you touch I feel, that my love for you is much too real
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams
Sleepwalkin' - I know every move you make, and every word I say
Keep it comin', comin' - comin' on stronger, this time I'm going all the way
