Alright

Gonna catch a flight to Nevada
Leave her friends at home in L.A.
Seven come eleven or blackjack
Gamblin' in night and day, yeah

'Cause she's a roller, now, a high roller baby
Mmm, she's a roller, yeah, a high roller baby
Alright, woo!

She likes to play for double or nothin'
She's tellin' all the boys she's hot
And everybody knows she's ready
