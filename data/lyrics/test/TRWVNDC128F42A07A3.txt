we didn't know
we didn't know
we want love
we want love

there were times I betrayed what was sacred to myself and lost
over lines I'm ashamed of the things that I had done and crossed
I was so fast to run when doubt had come
so fast to run, so fast to run

we didn't know
we didn't know
we want love
we want love
we didn't know
we didn't know
we want love
we want love
