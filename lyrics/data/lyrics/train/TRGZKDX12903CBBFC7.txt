It's late,
im stray,
im thinking about where we can go tonight,
this place,
i love,
will make us forget everything,
cos all,
i want,
is to hear that music pumping,
cos all,
i need,
is too hear the kick drum,
let me spin a little record for you baby,
pump it up,
make it loud,
bring the house down,
we can listen as the world goes crazy,
pump it up,
make it loud,
bring the house down,
every hour to end today,
this is the last song,
and thats okay so,
let me spin a little record for you baby,
Its out,
let go,
...
