We havin big thangs
Ice Cube, the only nigga that can bring Too $hort out of retirement
Representin money
Hmm, beeitch

Verse One: Ice Cube, Too $hort

Wise crackin felines, unh
Can a nigga make a bee-line?
to that nappy area, don't wanna marry ya
Just wanna bury ya head in a pillow
Sorry but I got a kilo pussy-willow
Janked ass penicillin, ain't got ta ask how ya feelin
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin
Ya wanna know how we keep these hoes in check?
Keep them broke and keep their panties soakin wet

I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass (fat ass)
Big thangs on my mind ain't trippin at all
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers
I feel like a giant sometimes, bitch don't stare
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin
Call a tech, blow the whistle, throw the bitch out the game

Chorus:

We havin big thangs (like it's the thang to do)
Big thangs baby ($hort Dawg and Cube)
