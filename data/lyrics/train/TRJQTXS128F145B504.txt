Bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man that's on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting as wild as a bug.
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm all shook up.
Ah, ah, ah, all shook up most of the time.

Well, my knees are shakin'
And my hands are gettin' weak.
Can't seem to stand on my own two feet.
Who do you blame when you, oh, when you found such luck?
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm all shook up, any old way

Yea please don't ask me what's up on my mind
