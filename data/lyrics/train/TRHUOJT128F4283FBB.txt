Bless her soul, and bless us all
Guide and protect her
Bless her soul, and bless us all
Bless her soul, ohwu

She lost track, couldn't get the monkey off her back,
ohhwu, oh no
Well she's trapped in her illusions yeae
And she's running from her self, running from her self
She lost her mind, she's like a prisoner serving time,
oh, yeahy
Say she wanna find herself, huh
But she's running out of time, running out of time, she
say
What am I gonna do now, where am I gonna hide, then she
cried again
