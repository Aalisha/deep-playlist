Here's to your weakend revolution
You can take your racist ideals and shove 'em up your ass
Here's to you and your fascist ways
'Cause as it turns out that's what you are
Here's to you man, a man with a plan
Too bad you only change it about twice a week

Here's to your weakend revolution
Here's to your weakend revolution

Here's to your weakend revolution
With your cheap scam you twist the minds of the youth
Here's to you the superior ones
