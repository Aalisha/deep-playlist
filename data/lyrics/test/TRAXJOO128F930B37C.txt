[Chorus]
Linguistics
Language think quick
Killed it, loved life and lived it
We twist it then shape and shift it (come on)
We gifted, young black with earrings
We provide to keep the party live
We strive to be wise and enterprise
Socialize, dip but never die
Set the bomber, keep our eyes on the prize, yo

Stay on top of this
See if you can follow this
Drink and swallow this
Eat from the hollow tips
(bom-bom-bom)
Bounce rock skate with the quickness
Shake your hip to this
Tell me if you feeling this
If you are
Let me know who you are
Turn it up real loud let it beat in your car
I'm the best by far like my man Omar
Make it real loud noise
Let me hear where you are

[Chali 2na]
Yo swinging the axe
Slapped quick
Match words
Cracks like chopstick
Hot spit
Lyrical packed with content
Never you had a empty con run
Musical bomb threat
Offset your defence
