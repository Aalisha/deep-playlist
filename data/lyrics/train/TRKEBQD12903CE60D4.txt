Lined up waiting for the execution
Blank stares fall from out of trees
Never leave home praying for the new solution
Sick from all the indifference in the breeze

Put your head down, you're tied up
With a blank stare you know that your time's up
Now you're lined up for the execution
For de-evolution
For the new solution

So you can see the way that things are gonna be

It seems like you've been running out
Like you've been running out now
Now it seems like you've been running out

God knows you could lose some pride
With an ego you could never even try to hide
