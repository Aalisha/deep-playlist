Don't waste my time, soul repairer...
For the blood that's gone dry, drained out from those who believed not.
Changing, changing my second skin...
Placing, placing my disbeliefs...

I'm all let open, was not closed all times.
Things we shared - hopeless, would you beat me blind...

Hold on to the pain that's never changing,
...
