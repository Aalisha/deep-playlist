I was walking down the Levee with my head hanging low,
Looking for my sweet mama but she ain't here no more,
Thats why Im crying Mississippi heavy water blues.

Lord, Lord, Lord, Im so blue, my house got washed away,
And im crying "how long for another pay day",
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues.

Im sitting here looking, at all of this mud,
And my girl got washed away in that Mississippi flood,
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues.

I hope she come back, some day kind and true,
Ain't no one satisfy her like her sweet papa do,
Thats why im crying Mississippi heavy water blues.
