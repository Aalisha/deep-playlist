Here we go, oh yeah
It? s all about You, yeah, yeah

So many days in so many ways
I took for granted, all You had planted
In my life for me to enjoy
Since I was a little bitty boy

Now my eyes are open so I can see
All You? ve done for me
You? ve made my life complete
Oh, what joy to me You bring
So forever I lift my voice and sing

It? s all about You
I? m so glad that I have found
The One who turned my life around
Made my world a better place to live

It? s all about You
I? m so glad You came this way
Made my darkness turn to day
Now it? s for You I believe

Whenever I think how good You? ve been
In spite of my sins, for all the wrong I? ve done
I can? t help but cry and ask, "Lord, why?"
Show me love unconditionally, in spite of

Now I? m taking this stand
Holding up my right hand
And for all of my days
I? ll give Your name the praise

Oh, what joy to me You bring
And forever I? ll lift my voice and sing

It? s all about You
