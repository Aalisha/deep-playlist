(M. Jagger/K. Richards)

I'm the man on the mountain, come on up.
I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud.
Yes, I'm stumbling and I know my car don't start.
Yes, I'm fumbling and I know I play a bad guitar.

I just wanna drink from your loving cup.
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.

I'm the man who walks the hillsides in the sweet summer sun.
I'm the man who brings you roses when you ain't got none.
Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight
