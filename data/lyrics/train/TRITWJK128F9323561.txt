God only knows what you do with yourself 
You sleep all the day and you're wasting away 
You beg for your food 
And you lie like a dog 
You steal all your moves and you drink the last drop

You changed me 
Like I knew 
You used me 
Like I used you 
My love shot right through you 

It's a low, low, low, low happening*4 

And every night at the beat of the drum
