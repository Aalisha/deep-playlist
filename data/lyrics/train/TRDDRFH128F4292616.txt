Down

Taking the first step
Has left you all dried up
The demon has slipped
And forced you under the gun

I can't see the future
No one can stop this
Nature's test is second best
Give a chance to sorrow

Never faulting, never feeling
It's already become this way
Never seeming that you're feeling
It's already become this fake
