The blood drips from your nose
With every lie you told
And with all you took from me
You're beggingfor insanity

Thought I died in my sleep last night
It's just wishful thinking
The pain build behind my eyes
So I will just keep on drinking

No wrong or right
Just wasting your life

Fading into sleep
