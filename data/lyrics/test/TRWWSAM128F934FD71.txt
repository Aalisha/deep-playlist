ah yeah, this is Mac Dre back in your face
(California)
I got my homeboy Coolie in the place
(California)
kick back, let us tell you about...

this California lifestyle that I live,
woofers in the truck straight slammin',
strike it through the neighborhood jammin',
where you could drop the top, or blow the brains,
hit in the intersection and do some things,
passin' up folks with a gang of yolks,
smooth, thick legs, no pantyhose,
silky perms and dookie braids,
brothers with curls, some with bangs,
have parties rock, way past three,
players straight sip on Hennessey
high street chasers, Chevy racers,
having sex in the strangest places,
Nike shoes, Levi's jeans,
triple gold Daytons and ------------,
some on vocals, some on leads,
brothers like me rap to the beat,
dual exhaust, candy paint,
fat bank and gang a dank,
never on time, always late,
on the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate,
if you wanna live on the best coast,
you better try to move to the west coast,
well, life is too short and the game is thick,
home of the Mac, and group of your chicks,
where brothers stay on the savage grind,
kids with the freak when they find the time,
the C-A-L-I-F-O-R ... N-I-A rap superstar,
dose for dose, I love to spit,
and for the dank, I love to hit it,
hold me in, so it can choke me,
when I get dank, it will provoke me,
just bust a rhyme, do the mike,
a west coast rap, the kind you like,
from V-A-double L-E-J-O,
well, makin' dope raps is all I know,
...
