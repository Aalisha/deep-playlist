Please, slow it down.
There's a secret magic password,
that you only notice when you're looking back at it…
and, all I wanna do is turn around.
I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean,
‘cause I couldn't let go.
And the water hit the setting sun.

Passing white daisies,
taking turns
close the door,
walk into the street catching raindrops on your tongue.
And for a minute… it all stops.
But it won't last me,
...
