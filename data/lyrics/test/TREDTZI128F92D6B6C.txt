If you feel like clapping your hands
You better come on, come on
Come on, come on

If you feel like you wanna dance
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

And if you feel like you wanna sing
Come on, come on, come on
Come on now, everybody sing along
Oh, sing it now

Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah
Oh, la de dah, yeah, oh, la de dah
Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah
Oh, yeah, everybody sing along
