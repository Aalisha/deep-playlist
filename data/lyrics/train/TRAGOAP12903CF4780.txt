We like to chat about
The dresses we will wear tonight
We chew the fat about
Our tresses and the neighbour's fight

Inconsequential things men don't really care to know
Become essential things that girls all find so apropros

It's all been planned, please take my hand
Just understand the sweetest
Girl talk
Girl talk

We all meow about
The ups and downs of all our friends
The who, the how, the why
...
