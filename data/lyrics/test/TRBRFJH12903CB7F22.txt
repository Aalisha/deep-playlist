[Excerpt from an episode of 'A Diff'rent World':]
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, I WANNA BE A BALL PLAYER.
I'M WISHING ABOUT BEING A BALL PLAYER, ABOUT BEING A
RACE CAR DRIVER OR ASTRONAUT.
YOU AIN'T, YOU AIN'T AFRAID TO DIE.
I RESPECT THAT, MAN. I RESPECT THAT
BUT WHAT ABOUT I HAVE TO LIVE FOR, MIKE?
MAN, THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO LIVE FOR!

(Uh, uh uh)
Being by where I live and it's making me sick
Brothers got me getting from going to school, but I can't quit
'Cause if I do (if you do), I'll be through (you'll be through)
...
