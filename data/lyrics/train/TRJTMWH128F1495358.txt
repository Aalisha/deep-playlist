We smashing,
Thousand be the head of the class 'n',
Rollin thru ya party with the stereo blastin' we creepin'
It's bin' seven since last weekend,
Everybody in the club freekin'
And in the corner, I can see ya standin' there,
Black jacket 'n' long hair we've been exchanging stares,
'n' I know ya, 'n' what'cha thinkin' yeah right,
Wearin' ya clothes air-tight at the club every night 'n',
Don't'cha know that brothers don't like the girls,
That be into the guys that be tellin them lies 'n' listen here hun,
Life's more than this,
Ya tryin to tell me that'cha never get bored of this?,

Yo, check this who you eye'in up for ya set list,
Frontin' with ya fake gold necklace,
Not respected, 'n' yet ya wonderin' why,
Seen the gleam in ya eyes, as soon as ya spotted them dolla signs $, Girl what's next? who you hittin' up for the rolex? Brothers need to check their specs,
