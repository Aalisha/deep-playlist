I take a stick of dynamite and put it to my mouth
Light it up, then I blast off like Alf
I be off (off) into another world
Got no time to be strapped to a freaking girl? Blood stones? I pop, let 'em fizz out on top
On my lizard tounge like a donk with the zert
I hung to the like break of dawn
Six-packs for the 'Nuts leave the baker

I want to get wrapped in the sheets so I can sleep or sleepwalk
Mumble when I speak, but when I freak I speak talk
Get married to Juana, dip for my oink
Always on point to bumrush my joint
See the party can't last with the glass on the vineyard
So I put some yellow liquid and some dump on the menu
One two, to the like one two, my vision's hazy
Don't test me now, this paper's got me crazy

Ayo you be buggin' off the styles I be freaking
Dusted, keep you in a daze when I'm speaking
Stutter to be butter, but if you want I make it milky
