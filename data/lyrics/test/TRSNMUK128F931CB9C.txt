Ooooh

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, ou were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark black night

Pack up all my care and woe
