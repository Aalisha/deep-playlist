oh whoa
oh oh
i never thought that i would ever love again
i might be wrong cos i can feel it happening
a little scared but i am not petrified
i love forever, i promise to stay by your side
heart broken, my first and never spoken
i waited to hear and i gave it a year
so i stopped holding on and then you came along
and then you came along
I'm gonna, I'm I'm I'm gonna


I'll hold you and i love you the best that i can
until you understand that i need you all in
and i can't dance alone cos the beat's just too slow
that's just the way love goes,
