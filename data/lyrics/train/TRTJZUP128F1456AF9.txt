Well I know that it's late but the words wouldn't wait
I'm really sorry that I woke you up
I don't know what's come over me
If I'm wrong let me know
Do you think I should go
But before you give an answer think of somewhere you'd rather be
All that I have twenty six dollars and the keys to a Cadilac
All that I know
Drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
All that I want and all that I need
All I wanna know is do you wanna come with me
You deserve more than this packing guilt for a trip
