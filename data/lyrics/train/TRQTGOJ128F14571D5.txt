When I read your letter I coudn't believe that you'd gone.
I dialled your number but no one answered the phone.
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you wer,
they said they thought that you were ill.
I hired a detective to try and find out where you are.
He managed to trace you, I know that you're living in France.
A watchman saw you climb into someone elses car
and drive off laughing in the night.
Why didn't you tell me. Not leave me this way.
