You're delicious, when you call me,
I've got nothing left to wait for,
You're delicious, when you see me,
I've got nothing left to pray for.

Woo-hoo, woo-hoo,

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

You're delicious, come and feed me,
I've got nothing left to cry for,
You're delicious, oh you sweet thing,
