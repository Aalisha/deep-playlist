Sir, excuse my rudeness but I believe
That I know somethin' that you don't
Because you are talkin' down to me
Like you think I know nothin'

And I won't allow it, this promise prowess
Though I respect you, even through the prejudice
You're blind leadin' blind's not hard to see, yeah

You gotta believe, oh, yeah
Don't fear, don't break it
You gotta be free
I hope your blinded eyes will see

You can ask me anythin'
I may not know the answers to everythin'
Nor I won't before I can do is speak from my heart
...
