1st Verse:
U say, I say, U say, I say, u say, I say,
but now your out there playin games
I knew that you would never change.
You say that you love me
but you still be wildin out
all of this yelling all of this fussing
over just nothing in my house.
I pray to my Savior and hope
he would just help me out
cause all of this confusion
got me just losing sight of what I should be doing now.
I can't lie I don't wanna waste no more time
I can't see why you never tried to do me right.
I can't lie I don't wanna waste no more time
I can't see why you never tried to do me right.

Chorus:
U say that you love me,
I say that I love you,
U say we don't ever have to fight,
I say I don't wanna ever cry,
U say you would never play the field,
