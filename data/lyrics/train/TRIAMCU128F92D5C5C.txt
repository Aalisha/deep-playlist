All the walls just fall away
Feeling stronger every day
I can see it in your eyes
When you laugh when you cry

This is more than summer wind
This is nowhere I have been
You have made me unafraid
Just to stay

If all I heard was your promise
And all you felt was my touch
If all we had was each other
We'd have enough, enough

All the drifting wounded hearts
...
