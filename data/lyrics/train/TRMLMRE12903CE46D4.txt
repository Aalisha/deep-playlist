The night we stole the moon, a pirate's paradise
The light along the ocean was in your eyes
It ended all too soon, it started suddenly
The bridge was almost open when we arrived

And when I thought I was lost you carried me across
Laughin' through the fallout zone
You touched me in a way I'd never known
And in the salt-scented air I followed you there
You taught me everything I know
I'm goin' down again South Ferry Road
