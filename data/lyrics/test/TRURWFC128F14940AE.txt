Black vinyl man with black plasticised imagination
More fodder for the new lost generation
I got a question to send you to the nearest closet
"Why can't you let us do it like Joni does it?"

There you go again, giving it your very best
Trying so hard to make it sound like all the rest
And as your factory sanctifies your wooden soul
Gave us TV dinners, now it's TV Rock 'n' Roll

We're growing up
We're growing up
To radio musicola
We're growing up
We're growing up
To radio musicola

I got political inclinations to announce
No way, if it doesn't scan with your accounts
I got some spiritual ideology for you
I know it's gotta correspond with the corporation view

We're growing up
We're growing up
To radio musicola
We're growing up
We're growing up
