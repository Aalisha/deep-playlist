She had a long line of lovers
Mostly the gambling kind
I didn't want to be like the others
And get left behind
I heard about her bad reputation
And how she had a heart of stone
How she'd give a man
A moment of pleasure
To get what she want.

I had a weakness for her kind of woman
I could never deny
I knew I would never see it coming
Until I was lost in her eyes
The more I tried to keep her at a distance
The more I became aware
She was breaking down my resistance
Till I no longer cared.
