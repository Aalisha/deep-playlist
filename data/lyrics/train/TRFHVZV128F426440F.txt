I found you broken on the ground
From your mouth a bitter sound
That became sweeter as I approached
You in your deepest agony

I put you up and raised you well
And more than stories ever tell
I fell in love with you those days
And hoped that you would too

You've been a fallen angel
Ripped out of the sky
But as your wings grew strong enough
You left me - behind to die

We built up our own world together
For our future I assumed
I believed in what you said that day
