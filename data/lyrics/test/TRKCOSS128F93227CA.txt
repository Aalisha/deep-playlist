Some other girls are filling your head with jive
So, now you're acting like you don't know I'm alive

Love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you

Suzie, only wants you until the day
(Only wants you until the day)
That she'll again have her true love
Who's far, far, away
(Her true love who's far away)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
...
