Gotta be love, it's gotta be love
It's gotta be love

Starin' out my window pane
Waitin' for the phone to ring
All I want is just to see you again
Oowie baby, I miss you so

So much that I can't sleep
So much that I can't breath
My heart it skips a beat
When I think of you and me

(It's gotta be love)
Somethin' about you boy
(It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy

(It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everythin' you wanna do

And when you're next to me
(It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy
(It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe
It's like I died and gone to heaven

Feels like I wasn't livin' 'fore I met you
Don't think that I can go a day without you
I spend my days plannin' to be 'round you
(Nobody else, there's only you)

No doubt this must be love
You're all I'm thinkin' of
It's takin' over me
So what else could this be?
