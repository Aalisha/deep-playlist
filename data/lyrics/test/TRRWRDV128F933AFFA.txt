All these places part of me
It fills me up and swallows me
My emotions wrapped in vines
Are reaching for the sun that shines
Oh, I must say I adore you
But sometimes I seem to ignore you
That's because I don't deserve to
Have your love for me ever

All this time, I wanted you to know
That if you're ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me
...
