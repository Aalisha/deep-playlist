(A. Roachford)
We've talked about life,
We've talked about love,
It gets to the point,
Where the words ain't enough,
There isn't a reason why this should be wrong,
Open your heart and I'll play you a song.
Come on, come on,
Lay your love on me,
Come on, come on,
Lay you love on me.
Don't you know sometimes you've gotta let yourself be free,
Don't you know it's your right, to be who you wanna be,
Don't you know there's a whole world out there,
...
