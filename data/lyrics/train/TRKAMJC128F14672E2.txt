Just one kiss we both remember
How that first love made our hearts
So crazy when...
All those summer nights together...
When every touch between us
Brought a lightning flash in the dark

Baby won't you wait, just a minute now
Before you go, turning away
Don't you know, what the two of us
Might just throw away
'Cause we got tonight
And the same old feeling again

Don't say no
Though it's a game we never win
We always ran against the wind
The love we made yesterday
Leads every move we make
...
