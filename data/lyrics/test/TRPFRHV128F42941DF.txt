Don't Mess With Doctor Dream
Don't Mess With Doctor Dream
Come lay your head down on the stone
So cool and white and welcome home
Oh lose your troubles, ease your pain
Soothe your soul in golden rain
(bridge)
Blue Marble Seas
I will make you feel so good
Roll over me
Blue marble dreams
Like you always knew you would
