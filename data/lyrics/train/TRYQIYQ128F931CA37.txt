Upon the powdered joints of human bones, 
In grim chambers and unhallowed ground, 
Tied down with ropes from skin and flesh, 
Here lies only ruin and damnation, 

The dead holler... endless and toneless
Rites of the miserable turned to dust, 
Your maggot-ridden hearts still beating, 
Fleshless, bricked up, and left to rot... 

Uncreation, 
Unspeakable Rituals, 
Into my rotten soul they wail, 
...
