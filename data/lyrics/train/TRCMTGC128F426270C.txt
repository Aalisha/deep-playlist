I'm a b-boy
That's the best way to define me
Born in '81, been rhymin' since the early 90's
And I don't plan on stoppin' any time soon
That's why fools try to be down with my crew
What you recitin' feeble chatter (?), either that or beatin' off
Peace to no-name breathin' patterns that'll leave 'em lost
I keep a choke-chain on the people's thoughts
Teach the whole game how to read between the chalk
Okay, we so crazy, don't play me, just pay me you babies
I break teeth on fake freaks (?), and maybe, just maybe, you might live
That's solely dependent on you mic skills
You rap slowly homie, no regard for what's ill
