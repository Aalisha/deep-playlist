Baby, come tell me 'bout your tree-house
And your candy-striped pet mouse
And your car that has feet
Hey, come tell me 'bout your eyebrows that meet
And my baby, won't you tell me 'bout your chilblains?
And your right eyeball's growing pains
And your purple tractor that sings
Hey, come tell me all of those things
But if you want to tell me some more
Think you can
Oh baby, tell me 'bout your lover man
