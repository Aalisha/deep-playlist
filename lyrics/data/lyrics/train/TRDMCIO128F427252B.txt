Come on, come on
Come on, y'all now
Put your hands together
Na-na-na-na
Put your hands together
Everybody now
Put your hands together
Na-na-na-na
Let us pray

We've got to pray for all
The brothers under thine hand
Pray for all the sisters
That's doing the best she can
Let us pray that tomorrow
There'll be a better
Day to come, yeah

We got to put our forces together
Sing a song so loud, so fair
That the birds in the trees
Hum along with me
Sweet harmony

Then let it thunder
Let it lightning, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
'Cause we're gonna sing
...
