Dancing on the tip of the evening moon
Precious kiss
This moment silver lips and gentle love

Out on the edge of an unknown world
Not alone
I see you, feel you
Dance with me

Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
(Search with me amongst the stars, amongst the trees)
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me

Falling pieces of a broken moon burn the sun
...
