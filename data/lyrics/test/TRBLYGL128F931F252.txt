2300 Jackson Street
2300 Jackson Street
2300 Jackson Street

Memories of growing up
And working hard
Our childhood passed us by

Mom and Dad
They sacrificed their wants and need
So we could reach the light
Although the times were tough for us
We knew they both worked hard
They gave us all their hearts could give
And still made room for love
We're all united
And standing strong
And still today
We're one big family
