This rock, I can't move
And the stones I try to throw are too heavy for me
Do you remember the troubled times?
You wanted it doubled, Â´cause you were troubled, I made it double

This soft, white sand
I walk upon
Reminds me of when I accidentally pushed you
The truth is jealousy led to hating you, and hate led to pushing
And pushing made me realize how much I loved you

Blow, blow away wind
Tears from my wet skin
...
