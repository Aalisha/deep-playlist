It used to be - I believed - everything
You said was real - I've had enough - I called your bluff
now I can see your hoves and horns
and now I'm getting out - ain't gonna hang around
long enough - for it to hit the ground
the same old lines - for which I fell
for every single lie you tell

Now you see - the hold on me
You had it's gone, gone, gone, gone

Doesn't matter what you say - I'm fearless
Doesn't matter what you think - I couldn't care less
Doesn't matter if you stay - doesn't matter if you go
Don't give a damn no more - no
...
