(G.Brooker / K.Reid / M.Noble)

Rings around the crescent moon
Passions rise from basement rooms
Fountains play and worlds collide
We gently swing and sway from side to side

Dancers in perpetual motion
Slip an' sliding across the floor
Ships our on a moonlit ocean
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore

Star-crossed lovers they spoon and swim
