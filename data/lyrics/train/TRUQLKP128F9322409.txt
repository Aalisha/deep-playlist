You keep calling it a crash and burn
Just wait your turn
You might have time to speak
There barely was a lesson learned
'Cause it'll return no favors back to me

I'm sure it tasted oh so sweet
But it was never good enough for me
I bit the tongue behind my teeth
It was never good enough for me

You said you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
I thought you promised me the world
Tell me what you're after
Go on and take you way too far
'Cause here we are, waiting once again
You said you always keep your word
Show me what you're after
Just a little faster

Are mine the only eyes that see, so steadily
...
