[banging on door, followed by sirens]

[Intro: Hell Razah]
You know what it is, right?

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
They don't wanna see us blow, they don't wanna see us with dough
They don't wanna see us flow, hell no, we glow
You knew it was the end the way we came in the door
Hit the club and I'm a leave with your hoe, hoe, hoe
My flames be hot every time that I throw
Ain't nothing new son, I did this before
GGO, my niggas flip money like it ain't no more
'Cause no friends when there ain't no more

[Hell Razah:]
For the lust of currency, they put their trust in this country
All your friends be cunningly when they hungry
Jealousy wanna stop the prophet
Niggas hate to see money in our pockets but they don't knock it
