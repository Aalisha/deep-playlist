It was summer
And I remember
We stole a way to that park
We talked for hours until blue skies got dark

It was winter
And I remember
You were making eyes at me
There were no place I was ever gonna righter be

Oh no
Through the seasons
Baby, somethings don't change
A dousin yellow roses
The sound of your name
No
Those days and years slip
Through our fingers like sand
Will I stay in love with you
With everything that I am
...
