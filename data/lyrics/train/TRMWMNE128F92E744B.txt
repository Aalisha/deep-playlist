You struck me like lightning
turned my world upside down
when I first laid my eyes on you

This feeling's really frightening
cuz it seems to me I've found
the perfect man of all for me to choose
used to a dream of such a man like you
never thought it would come true
boy you are the answer to my prayers

I never felt like this before and
you have opened up the door
into a space that I would never dare

Cuz you give my a meaning
