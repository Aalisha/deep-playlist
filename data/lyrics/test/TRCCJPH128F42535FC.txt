I'm fighting through stages
And it burns me alive
A truth you will never believe
But no modern messiah will arise

Burning the place - set to burst
Coming from the pain
Thunder crash from far beyond
No one will remain

Hear me out of the dark
Come to break the spell
Come with me to the other side
Hear the final bell
...
