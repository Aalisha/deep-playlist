Sweet little woman can't you see
that you're the only one for me
you make me feel good, so good inside
stay by me woman for the rest of my life
and as I think of you more every day
There's only one thing I can say
and that's:

Girl, I think the world about you
always thinkin' of you
Girl, I think the world about you
...
