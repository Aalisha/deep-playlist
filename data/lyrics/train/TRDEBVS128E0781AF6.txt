Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the Nineties
Is paranoid

Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone, you really love

Avoiding all work
'Cos there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
