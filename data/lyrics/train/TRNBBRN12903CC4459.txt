[OK]

Only this (moment)
Holds us to(gether)
Close to per(fection)
Nothing is (out there)
No one to (guide us)
Lost in the (senses)
Deep down inside I know our love will die
[OK]

Only this (moment)
Holds us to(gether)
Lost in con(fusion)
Feelings are (out there)
Scared of de(votion)
Doubting in(tentions)
Deep down inside I know our love will die
[OK]
