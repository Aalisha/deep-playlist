Before electric light
You paddled through the soup of darkness as a crocodile
Cherry picking in the river
I would leave crisp note footprints at the Bankside

Watch it closely you see it begin to move
Watch it closely you see it begin to flicker

While we're here, let's see what happens
What we got, got, got to lose
While we're tidal and flexed on a full moon
It'd be a sure, sure shame to not to

In every wonder what you are
I've blurted everything I know just for a piece of it
Flash frozen, patchworked and fallow
...
