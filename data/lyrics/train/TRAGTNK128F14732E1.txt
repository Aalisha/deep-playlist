There's a voice inside our soul
Calling out so we don't fall
Nothing's lost that can't be found
Ain't a thing you can't get 'round

Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
Gonna find you'll never lose
Turn it into something special

When your calm is broken too
And you don't know what to do
Hold your fire and look above
Take the flame don't put it out

Turn it into something good
There's a chance you really could
Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
