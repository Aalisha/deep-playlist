Fight, we will fight right,
Living low in a world of our own,
Destined to live right, fight,
We're taking hell as our home,
Burning lives burning,
Asking me for the mercy of god,
Ancient cries crying,
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,

Welcome to hell,
Welcome to hell,
Welcome to hell,
Welcome to hell.

Kill we will kill death,
...
