Do you believe in a world
Where we can achieve
The same goal, the same dream
We know we can succeed

Something inside so strong
I know you got the heart
Something inside so strong
The heart to carry on

One world, one dream
Where everybody's free
One heart, one team
A world for you and me

One world, one dream
Where everybody's free
One heart, one team
A world for you and me
