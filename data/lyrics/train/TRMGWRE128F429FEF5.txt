Luke Bryan - We Rode in Trucks

Down where I was born was heaven on earth.
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt.
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright.
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids.
You either lived on a farm or wish you did.
Jesus always walked close by our side.
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks.

How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss.
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got.
