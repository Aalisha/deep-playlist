Tripping out
Spinning around
I'm underground
I fell down
Yeah I fell down
I'm freaking out
Where am I now?
Upside down
And I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now

ooh
I, I, I'll get by
I, I, I'll survive
When the worlds crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I, I won't cry
