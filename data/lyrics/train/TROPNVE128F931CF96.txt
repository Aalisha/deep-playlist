Crazy days of crumpets in a crazy raisin rhyme
Sell it for a nickel when you buy it for a dime
Underneath the water is a crackle and a line
Lay upon your belly 'til the stone aligns your spine

I see you
I see you
Oh yes I do (x2)

Crazy days of trumpets in a crazy raisin rum
Lay upon your belly 'til your mind goes numb
Underneath the water is a crackle & a hum
Tweedle-deedle dee
And a tweedle-deedle dum
And a tweedle-deedle dum
And a tweedle-deedle dum

I see you
I see you
