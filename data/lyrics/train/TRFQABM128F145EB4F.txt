I got my plans made
I have my heart set
I know my futures bright
But I trust You
And I give em to Ya
Or they won't turn out right

So I lay them down
So I lay them down
I lay them down
I lay them down

I got a couple years/that I wish I could get back/-- I took the wheel then I got off track/won't complain about the past but I'm glad to be back/and I'm man enough to admit my thinkin was whack/See the windshields fuzzy and the rearview's clear/but I can't make my plans at the end of the year/don't know in advance like the drumroll playing/thought let's wait and see was a dumb 'ol saying/but them old saints know that's part of the plan/you can't see the way so you hold His hand/think of that, why God wanna walk with a man/Picture that why the Lord wanna talk to the sand/that He made wit His hand/I don't know, but I'm thankful He can/make a way, split the waters and I'm on dry land/He got me and He got my fam/so I lay back and chill like I'm getting a tan, feel me?
