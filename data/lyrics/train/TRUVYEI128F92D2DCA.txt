We don't own it

You will know by the way
That he cuts his eyes
Looks away from the door
That walked in you
You will know it will go
Down in history
How sweet he was to you
And all the others

So hand it over
Cause we don't own it
It's in the mystery
Our silent fantasy
Cause i
Nor you
Could ever
...
