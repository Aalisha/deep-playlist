When the worldâ€™s at war, who will you be for?
When it comes to life, are you the enemy?
Have we lost our minds or are we just blind
To the world outside? This is reality

Burn it up, the world's on fire
And all that's left are cheaters and liars
What once was whole, is now divided
The strong are weak and the world's out of control

A new life is born without anyone
Who will give to him sense of morality?
Could be good, could be bad but no one gives a damn
So he turns the world into his enemy
