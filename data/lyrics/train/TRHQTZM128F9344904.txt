My little lover's gonna be another
Copy of Raquel Welch
I'll build her a house and a maid named Jill
And spend tha rest of my life down in Beverly Hills

I'll never have to feed her
And she'll stay pretty all the time
Oh, yes she will

I love the way she's gonna rock and roll
From the early morning 'til late at night
Non stop rock 'n' bop and she'll never ever die

When I want money she can go to work
As a roadie for Adam Ant
...
