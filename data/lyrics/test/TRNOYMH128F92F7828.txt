Fancy satin pillows that you bought
For me to place beneath my head
I must admit they're very nice
But I would rather have your arms instead

To have you here beside me just feel your warmth
So very close is what I need
More than all the fancy satin pillows
You could ever buy for me

Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows
