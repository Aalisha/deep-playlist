Your game, your lovely game
Is like pain and suffering
Your fame, your newly found fame
Is like repeating history

You now that keeping me around
Makes me just quiver at the sounds
Wish I could feed their open mouths
With something worth it

Where is your backbone?
'Cause you're looking very flimsy
I'm breaking down your paper wall

Where is your backbone?
If you hear it sing it with me
Everybody take the fall

You look so sound asleep
I can't believe that your backbone's missing
And you never had a clue at all
...
