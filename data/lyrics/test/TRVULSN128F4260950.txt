Oh I'll miss him
Woah I'll miss him
Woah I'll miss him

I want him and I need him
And someday, someway, woah oh oh oh, I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy and real good looking too
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do

Like walking in the rain
(Like walking in the rain)
Wishing on the stars up above
 (And wishing on the stars up)
And being so in love
