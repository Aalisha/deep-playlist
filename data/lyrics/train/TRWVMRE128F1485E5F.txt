You can put it down to lack of patience
You can put it down to lack of sleep
But it's in my head to stay in bed
Tucked under the sheets

They said if you try to get on I'd get on
They said there were chances
But now my chance has gone

And I know what you think
What you think about me
Thoughts like that sink home
To you we're not deep
...
