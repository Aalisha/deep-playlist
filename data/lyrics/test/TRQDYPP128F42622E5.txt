Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Just for the attention
Cause that's just ridiculous... ly odd.
Well, she sure is going to get it
Here's the setting
Fashion magazines line the walls now
The walls line the bullet holes

Have some composure
And where is your posture?
Oh, no, no!
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong

Have some composure
And where is your posture?
Oh, no, no!
You're pulling the trigger
Pulling the trigger
All wrong

Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break!
