My little mind so snugly fits within this tiny skull at month eleven! 
Less room for cheats; for ugly thug's deceits; 
For brats and boobs on channel seven.

I will shine Light to lead the blind.
I'll be fine 'til Hell fucks all the Heaven that is left inside.

Aye! Me mind! meet your muse at four, when all the world's a backstage banquet! 
Hey, little mind! what else, pray tell, is in store? Quick! 
Before they teach us Language!
