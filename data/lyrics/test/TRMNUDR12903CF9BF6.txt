Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes.
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
Solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
Words for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline,
Such an underwhelming thrill.
Where there's a will there's a wake,
Burn me at the stake,
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool I feel so fake.
