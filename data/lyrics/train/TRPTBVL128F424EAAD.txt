So you want my affection
We both know you'll only throw it away
But if you must have a go, fine, okay
If you must have a go, then go away

I'm making eyes at you
I've been making these eyes now, making these eyes since '82
I've been making them green and grey and brown and delta blues
I'm reciting a mantra but I can't tell you cos you're missing to me
That's all you'll ever be

Oh please don't, please don't speak
You'll kill the mystique
Oh baby let's not, let's not dance
We'll ruin our chances
Oh, in between the drinks
I can't help but think that
Even as we speak
...
