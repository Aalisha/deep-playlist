There's a bunch of guys in town
Whose been buggin' you and hangin' around
And calling you on the phone and talkin' real smart
Ev'ry brand new him that calls is one of them
They're trying to mess us up and make us part

They're gangin' up on my baby
Comin' on strong
Tryin' to turn you against me and take you home
But baby, don't listen, baby
...
