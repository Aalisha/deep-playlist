The walls are moving closer now
Can you feel it, can you feel it?
You are not saved until you see the dawn
Set my Eden on fire now
You did it, you did it
Smoked out my soul once and for all

I'm coming home tonight
Can we make it right?
Or twist a dagger in my back
You lit the fires in me that I never thought I had
Now it's nothing but a memory...
