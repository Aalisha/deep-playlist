There's an angel crying up in Heaven tonight
And I've got the Devil in my heart
Because I keep saying things that I don't mean
And it's tearing us apart

There's a wild wind blowing in the desert tonight
Oh how I long to feel the rain
And let it wash away these lonely tears
And bring us back again
'Cos it's a different world when I look into your eyes
You're the nearest thing that I have seen to Paradise
