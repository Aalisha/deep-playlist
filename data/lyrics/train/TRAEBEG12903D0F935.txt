Don't think I'm strange, strange things are happenin
Black people live the life I know we love the life you live
WAAAAAAA!!!!!!!! Watch it, mi shout

My name is Danny and see, I'm only twenty four
I used to have my own key, to push my own door
But now I'm livin on the street side, because I'm all alone
Distressed and strained in poverty, leave me without a home
Just because my girlfriend left me, she found somebody else
I think so much about her, I keep on talkin to myself
I get so weak and lazy, I just can't do my work
My boss said I am crazy, fired me and called me a jerk
Everything I earned in my life I give it all to you
You leave my life unhappy, I don't know what to do
But so help me God, I do the best I can
And now you leave me and I don't know where my future stands
