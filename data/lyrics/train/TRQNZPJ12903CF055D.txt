Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
See if it's true
Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
See if it's true
See if it's true
See if it's true
Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
Won't you come
Cause I've been waitin'
