Another night of maybe and almost
Abandoned in a land of passing ghosts
Just a lot of sad people, forgive them, Lord
They don't care what they do or who they do it to

At the dog and pony show
They don't wanna know
To think I could have stayed home

Instead of watching this ugly lust and ordinary dirt
But no one cares so nobody gets hurt
Just a lot of sad people, forgive them, Lord
...
