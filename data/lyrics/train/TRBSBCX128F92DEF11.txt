You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby
Oh
It's okay to say you got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated than love, love, loved for what you're not

You're vulnerable
You're vulnerable
You are not a robot
You're loveable, so loveable
But you're just troubled

Guess what?
I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what?
I'm not a robot, a robot
