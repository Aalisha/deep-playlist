I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you

They said you were leaving
Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see its true

Tell me all about it
Tell about the plans you're making
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
