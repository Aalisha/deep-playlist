Tears fill up my eyes
I'm washed away with sorrow
And somewhere in my mind
I know there's no tomorrow

I see that you're leavin' soon
I guess you've had your fill
But if I can't change your mind
Then no one will

And all throughout all the years
I've never strayed from you my dear
You suspect I'm somewhere else
...
