This is no ordinary girl
Ain't got no jaded feeling
Behind the foolin' lies the strength
For a vision to come, I must come clean

And it's a bad, it's a bad, such a bad state of affairs
That she holds in the palm of her hand
And it's a bad, it's a bad, such a bad state of affairs
I hope she can understand it
...
