Got to
Got to

You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers
Hear why

To come original it ain't nothin' strange
You got to represent you got come full range

That's full range of emotion full range of styles
When you come to town you'll have them comin' for miles

Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original
All entertainers
Hear why

Black Eyed Peas they comin' full range and
NOFX they comin' full range and
Roni Size he's comin' full range
The one Mr. Vegas you know it ain't easy
