I got a cocaine woman and she's cookin up a pound of pills
Another ride to the station and you know I'm gonna pay the bills, lord
I gotta go see my baby
gotta run run run
The only girl I loved
It'll be the last one
I know I know
She's hell on wheels
I know how she feels boy

I like the way that she moves when she moves me
