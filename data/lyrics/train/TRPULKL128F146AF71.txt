I was talking, not two days ago
To a certain bartender I'm lucky to know
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
If I should bother dating unfamous men
And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know me
You're lucky to be alive
You're lucky to be drinking here for free
'Cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes"

And then he said
Do you want to be a polyester bride
Do you want to hang your head and die
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here
