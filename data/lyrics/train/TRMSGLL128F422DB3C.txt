I used to be the man for you
Did everything you wanted me to
So tell me, baby, what did I do wrong

I told you what you wanted to know
Precious secrets never spoken before
All I'm asking, where did I go wrong

Some things are better left unsaid
But all I do is cry instead
Now I've cried me a river
Thinking how it used to be

And there've been too many tears falling
And there've been too many hearts breaking in two
Remember what we had together
