Liquid Sky
Key to Heaven
The Milk of Paradise
That's what they used to call it

Forget what you think you see
And what you think you know
They're just memories now
You need to let them go

If you can't forget
Who you used to be
Then your words are untrue
And the things they mean

Forget what you see
Forget what you know
It's all that you need
Let yourself go
...
