Working in the rain cutting down wood
Didn't do my little brother much good
Lost two fingers ina chainsaw bite
All he does now is drink and fight
Sells a bit of grass hots up cars
Talks of travel never gets far
Loves his kids left his wife
An everyday story of country life

And the red brick cottage where I was born
Is the empty shell of a holiday home
Most of the year there's no-one there
The village is dead and they don't care
Now we live on the edge of town
Haven't been back since the pub closed down
One man's family pays the price
FOr another man's visio of country life
