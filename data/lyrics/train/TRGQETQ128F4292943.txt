One sunny, sunny morning
When my man’s right by my side
Held me closely, so close I felt love inside
Its like paradise when he
He called me his favorite girl
And for sure he’s my favorite boy
And I’ll be there when he needs me to be like no other woman gives you joy cause I
I’ll give him
Good love to you
Sweet love to you (sweet love)
There when you say (there when you say)
Gotta do for you (gotta do for you)
Hold onto you (hold on to you)
Right here for you
Ooooooohhh
Good lovin'
Good love to you (good love to you)
Sweet love to you (sweet love)
There when you say (I’m there, I’m there)
I gotta do for you (gotta do for you)
Hold onto you (hold on to you)
Right here for you (right here)
