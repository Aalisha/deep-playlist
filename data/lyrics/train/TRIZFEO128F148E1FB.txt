Oohhh you hit me like a high speed freight train
Just when I thought all was lost
Now intrigue desire racing all through my brain
I opened Pandora's box
My best friend done told me that you were the shit
See that added fuel to my fire
With the eyes of an angel and a mouth made for sin
Speaking words made to inspire

Something gotta hold of me
Hell 'O- automatic chemistry
This is the way I feel
