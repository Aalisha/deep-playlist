I've been around the world
And every man bleeds the same
But when the lights are dim
You never know who's to blame
I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
No other place for me to go
No other place for dying slow
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
