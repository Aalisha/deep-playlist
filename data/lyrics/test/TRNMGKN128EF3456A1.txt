Call someone
Tell them how you feel
Call someone and tell them what you think is wrong
Beat the ground
Show it how you feel
Show it all the ways that you've been taught to feel

And the bigger you are
The harder you fall
You just need to call and let someone know
And the faster you think
Is the time that you'll need just to say hello
