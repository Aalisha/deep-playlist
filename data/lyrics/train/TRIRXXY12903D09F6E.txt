Surgical embryonic murder in the womb
Termination abominates
Dead--a lifeless tumor
Premature, suctioned through a uterine syringe

Forcible cervical drainage

Blood expelled from the womb
Massive hemorrhage flood
Noisesome afterbirth
Vile wrenching surgery
Abolished embryos
Genetic massacre
Aborticide

Mutilate, umbilical entangled on a hook
Laceration evacuates
Torn--a split placenta
Cauterized, electric current
...
