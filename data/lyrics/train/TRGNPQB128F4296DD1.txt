Yeah. yeah. aight? Motherfuckers!
Bitch-ass niggaz, faggots
Come through nigga... YO!

[Havoc]
I creep on the tippy-toe, surprisin the enemy
And ain't nobody safe unless you bulletproof E'RYTHING
Clappin at your baby, includin your entourage
Don't be 'fraid of these slugs, they get you closer to God
I'm a homegrown terror, my pops planted the seed
When I wild, don't be mad at me, should blame him
War with us? The start of your end
Beef with these faggot-ass rappers started the trend
P? That's my grimy for life, don't fuck with him
And if word get back to me, I'm buckin you
Know it's on me hammers stuck to the hand just like glue
