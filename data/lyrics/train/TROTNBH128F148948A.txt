I stare at the door
Trapped in a dream
Held like a captive
By what people see on the outside
They don't really know
And even with You
I deny what is real
The loving truth is a painful touch
When guilt is all you feel
I want to run away
You've got to help me stay

Chorus:
Your healing touch
To know Your love
Just to feel Your strength in me again
The rivers are deep
Where they're flowing
...
