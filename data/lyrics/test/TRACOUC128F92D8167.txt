Verse 1 (Tak)


Yeah
Uh huh
I remember forever
What I would do to get better
When I was cruising Winnetka
That's when the crew was together
We use the music to severe ties
For the people in disguise
Nevermind never stop
Never look back doe
Just keep on going right
So that's what I did
When I got up in the crib
Just writing, split my wig
Hmmm
Can't even think, got a block, I'm stuck
So I had to turn around and dig
Reach, reach
Pull out something
I don't even know why the beat keep bumping
Round and round we go
Pound the ground below
Sound of every function
Here it is
Turn it up
That's what I like
When I'm on stage live
And rap in the mic
And the people in the front
When they clap when you hype
And those that smoke
When packing the pipe
That's tight
Aight so
Never know when you might just blow
So I had to put it down in a song
With Styles of Beyond
And that's how the night goes
Uh

Chorus (4-Zone and Ryu)

You want that shit but not for free
We don't checks or property
So pop that mess but not with me
Unless you got that proper fee
And if you can't come up with it
I can't make impulse purchases
And blow my dough on kicks and shit
It's all your fault
I'll make you pay you gotta
Problem with the sound now
Fuck you pay me
I'ma put you underground now
Fuck you pay me
If the club burn down mother
Fuck you pay me
Ten bucks a thirty thou now
Fuck you pay me
