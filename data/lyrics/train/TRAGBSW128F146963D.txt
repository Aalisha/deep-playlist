(written by Janis Ian and Buddy Mondlock)
Just the pattern of sunlight on a building
Just a flash in a window I was passing
Just a frame in a movie I remembered
Amsterdam
Just the sound of a wheel in the gravel
Just the click of a heel on the pavement
Just a moment like any other moment
Amsterdam
I remember your lips, I remember your eyes
