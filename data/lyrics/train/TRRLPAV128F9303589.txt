And thats how we keep it crunk, from the club to the streets
To the two door Capri, crunk out with the beat
We shakin' hoes off, cut em' up like a slab
Then hit the studio and take it back to the lab

If 5 on 2, shit its all good, we ride through the hood
In the Delta 88' with that Georgia license plate These niggas, don't know
They don't even wanna show no love to a nigga, like me, so I just stay On the grind, stay down for mine tryin' to get mine in daily

Holla' at me like you know your foe, chiefin' on that green
Never snort a lot of coke, stayed down with the home team
Know what I mean, some shit, have a nigga, stressed out
Make him small fast

Bout' 175 will quit to open that cannon and woop your ass
But ya' wait, get a bat face on the one-time while these hoes
Choose on the Attic Crew, my girl already been chose
These stankin' bitches get your boy caught up in that fuck shit
I know they suckin dick, but they thanking the game I spit

I put they ass in a rap and ride out on them hoes
Get wit' my slick part now, then hit the studio
Now see I jumps up, without a doubt
Not a question being asked as you dash, with no way out

Through the whirl-wind I spin, intruders, we break em' in
Atlanta Georgia, we comin' for ya' with 50 men
In sets of 10, no sippin' gin, we steppin' in its the Attic Crew
No flaw within, we them Youngbloodz wit' plenty kin
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no grins

We after you, so what you do is count to three then click your shoes
Then out the door, back to your hoe, down on the low
Straight, toe to toe, 'cause J-Bo is who I be, won't fuck with you
Don't fuck with me, so can't you see through the enemies
