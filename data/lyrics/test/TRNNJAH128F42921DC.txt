These honky tonks and bright lights used to thrill me
I'd paint the town and stumble in at dawn
But now there's no one listening for my footsteps
And it's windin' down to one more night alone

I thought I had her wrapped around my finger
I didn't think this bridge would ever burn
I always thought she'd take me back
