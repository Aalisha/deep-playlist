Every little thing you do
Makes me feel a little love for you
And every little thing you say
Makes me say, oh baby we should float away

I could never calculate
Everything out on a plate
'Cause every little thing you say
Makes me feel like I can't wait

What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe

What you gotta do?
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
