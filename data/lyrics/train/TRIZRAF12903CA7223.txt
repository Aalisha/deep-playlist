Turn me on telephone wires
I'm tangled up for good
My mom says don't get carried away
Tonight I will sleep so good

My tiny match is burning constant apathy
Your tiny lungs are screaming for some suffering
I'll hold you close at night
I'll tuck you in for a while

Well, all dolled up, now put on all your make up
You're screaming look at me
All tied up and contagious
...
