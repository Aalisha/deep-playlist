Around here, it's the hardest time of year
Waking up, the days are even gone
The collar of my coat
Lord help me, cannot help the cold

The raindrops sting my eyes
I keep them closed.
But I'm feelin' no pain

I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?
Say it aint so, say I'm happy again
Say it's over, say I'm dreaming

Say I'm better than you left me
...
