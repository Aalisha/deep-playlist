everyday youre gone
its killin me to be without you
cant make it alone

everyday youre gone
its killin me to be without you
cant make it alone
girl cause im missin you

its like i got a hangover
i cant get you outta my head
jus like i wrecked my new rover
girl i cant get you out of my head
and i aint never been low but
its like im broke and im outta the game
so i swallow my pride if thats the only way
to make it better babe

i kno i been wrong (kno i been wrong)
& we been fightin so long (we been fightin so long)
come & see about me (come & see about me)
its gettin hard to breathe (ooohhh)
baby im sorry

i miss you
everyday youre gone
its killin me to be without
without you
i cant make it alone
baby can we work it out
