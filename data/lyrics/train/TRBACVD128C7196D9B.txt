Yeah, oooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ohh

I'm standing in the club, doing my own thing
When you thought you would approach me (hey, hey)
Saying things that you shouldn't be
I'm not your average girl
You can't put your hands on this
So I move to my right
Stay out my sight
Ooh don't trip no

So stop scratching around here
Cos I feel a messy atmosphere
You never gonna get my love
Is that clear? (ooh yeah)
You can't creep up to me fool
I'm too focused to lose my cool
See you from a mile away, ohh

(CHORUS)
Buster trying to get his hands on me
Spinning a lie to get me in a taxi
No ***** in your sting (NO!)
You ain't getting a thing (NO!)
Buster trying to some dirty
Trying to simulate a fantasy
No ***** in your sting(NO!)
Should I'll repeat it again (NO!)
