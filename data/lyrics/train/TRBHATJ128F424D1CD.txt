It's been a long winter 
And finally the evenings are 
getting longer and warmer 
I guess most of you guys are just like me 
You had your share this winter 
But something happens 
every year at this time... 
You want more 

And another spring just broken, 
here we go again 
Short skirts frequently appearing, 
I think you know what I mean 
Don't worry about a thing, 
let's see what it brings 
So bite the night, demand your right, 
we know you understand
