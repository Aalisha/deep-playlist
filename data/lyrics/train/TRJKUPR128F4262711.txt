Move!
There's no telling what I'ma do
I'm eighty-thousand years of natural selection comin through
You ain't got as much aggression, possessions, weapons
I'll be damned if I get outdone by the next man
If you're beliefs are different than mine, then we gonna fight
Who needs peace when you can profit from being right?
I hold picket signs outside abortion clinic doors
Take what I want with force
And my God could kill yours

(?) species evolving so slowly
Genetically infantile, violent and holy
We think we're so smart but there's not much to know
Caveman is still alive behind those robot eyes
Fully controlled by ten thousand year old instincts
Hands on the war button, flinch and your world's extinct
...
