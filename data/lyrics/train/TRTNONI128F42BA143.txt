I'd like to find something
I got my best dress on
And I'll play from 'Dusk Till Dawn'
And 'When You Sleep Tonight'

I'd hold my pillow tight
I'd turn all the lights off

Oh, I say, don't say
That you're up to nothing
Your sure up to something
Today, boy I'll start a laughing
'Cause you will pay

Save the lies I'm a saying
I might get a bit rough
If he ain't good to me
Oh, good to me

So I say with a smile
'Cause I know that he'll be good
You better be good to me
You better be good

You better treat me nice
...
