Oh oh oh oh

Where were you when i needed you
Well you could not be found
What can i do, oh i believed in you
You're running me around
Well you can take it as a warning
Or take it anyway you like
It's the lightning, not the thunder
You never know where it's gonna strike

Our love's in jeopardy, baby, ooh
