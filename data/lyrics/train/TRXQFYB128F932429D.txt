Untie these ropes around my neck
Still I'm dropping to my knees
So conscious smiling discontent
Affecting lo que pienso de ti
Hasta ya

Never mind
Who's to say?
It's hard to rest when everybody's
On your case
On your own
It's hard to sleep when everything is
All concern
Who is right?
Its hard to breath when this intention
Feels so wrong
Feels so right
Feels so wrong
