Joker smoker, joker smoker
Some a joker smoker, joker smoker, joker smoker

Smoking is a habit, some man can' maintain it, oh yeah-yeh-yeh
Them come on your corner, them a beg you sensimilla, yeh-yeh-yeh
You gi' them sensimilla, them a beg you a rizla, yeh-yeh-yeh
You gi' them de rizla, them a borrow your lighter

To give away I don't feel no way
But every day you a come wit' your same say
"May I beg you a spliff, sir?
May I beg you a cigarette, sir?
May I borrow your lighter?"

'Cause them a joker smoker
