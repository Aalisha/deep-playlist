As the night's casting shadows upon the city walls
He finds his way in the dark dressed in black to become unseen
He's moving with the secrets of his sacrifice
See the moon in his eyes and the lost paradise
It's weighing him down as he stumbles around yeah
Lonely road leaving burn marks from the fire
Rusty soul from the spikes that nailed him down
He's a man of the dark always hiding in his broken heart
Crying demon of the sun forever dying on the run
