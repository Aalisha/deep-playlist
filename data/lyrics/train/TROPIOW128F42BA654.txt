I'm going out to get some air will you join me
I want to feel the wind on my face will you join me

Let my hair fall on my shoulders
Let the sun shine on my skin
I dreamt too much last night
And then I couldn't sleep
Worries got a hold of me

Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
But men they oppress me

Suffocating me I have no dignity
Only God can see me
