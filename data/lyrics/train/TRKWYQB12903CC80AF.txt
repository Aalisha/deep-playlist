I gaze into the blackened sky
Before my eyes eternity opens
I can feel it through the night
The calling of the mist
Burning shapes born in shadows
My name they speak in tounges
They bid me welcome to explore
The frozen land of sin

Visions forms into the clouds
Behold! The face of mine
The truly me is no linger a quest
Under black winds I ride
The hunger for my soul
Raise into the sacred knife
I hear the moans of death
My life has to end

With sacred gleaming steel
...
