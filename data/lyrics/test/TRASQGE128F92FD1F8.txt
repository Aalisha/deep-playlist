Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters

Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man
