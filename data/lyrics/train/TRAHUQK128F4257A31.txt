Said hey I found a pretty little Buttercup
While I was walking one day
And she was such a pretty little buttercup
I saw her walking one day
I said, "Hey, you're such a pretty little buttercup
I'd like to take you away... but oh!
You're such a pretty little buttercup
I don't believe that you'd stay"
