Someone call in an ambulance
Cause' something's not right
It's all going wrong tonight
In between thebottom of this bottle and you
I think I'm running into rock bottom

This time I'm in over my head from couting times that Ive said
"This time I'm in over my head from counting times that I've said it's over it's over"

Someone call in an ambulance
