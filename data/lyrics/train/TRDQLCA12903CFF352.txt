I am pain
I am real. I'm not a dream
I'm the chain around your neck as you scream

Surrender now
You can't beat death at his ruthless game
Make your bow
Hang your head in shame

I can't believe there is no way out
You'll I find you are wrong
You fill me with doubt
You were never that strong
I am pain
I am the wound that never heals
It's all in vain
...
