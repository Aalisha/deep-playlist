All systems down, something's wrong
Unplugged and freezed to the bone
Feels like I'm locked out, helpless within
I can feel uncertainty's rising

And we will wake up when it's too late
Tower of power is crashing down
My life will be erased, no files will be found

Gazing the screen, feeling the power
