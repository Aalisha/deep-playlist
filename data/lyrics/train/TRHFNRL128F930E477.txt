The question isn't whether it's true
The question- "Is it working for you?"
Marshmellow Skies
And custardy pies
And nothing's too hard to do

They're five happy verses or so
They told me all I needed to know
Ignore all the rest
Trials and tests
And threats to my comfort zone

Well I've got no time to find out what's real
I stick with what I happen to feel
It feels grand
...
