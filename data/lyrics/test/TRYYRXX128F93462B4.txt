(Intro: Snoop Dogg)

DPG (G), C

(repeat 4 times)

(Verse One: Kurupt)

Smash, just before you talk spaz out
Hittin' the switch, then hittin' the stash
Before the year 2000, all the computers crash
I'm gone homeboy, this the hood where it's on homeboy
I'mma live long homeboy
Too deep, too strong homeboy
We rollin' too deep with two zones homeboy
It's on homeboy
Songs with two candy-painted bronze homeboy
D-A-Z, I can't believe this nigga gon' trip
He's nothin but a busta, bitch-ass mothafucka
With Snoop in the coop, Warren, Nate, and big Tray Dee
Big C-Style and Mitch made to be
Shine Dogg gettin' super-high lit
High-flyin' high super-duper high
We super-duper fly
I put ya in the mix
I ain't with that Kibbles-N-Bits shit
Bitch, where's the grip?

(Chorus: Nate Dogg *singing*, (Snoop Dogg))

I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, I'm Neva Gonna Give It Up (DPG {G}, C)
Neva Gonna Give It Up
C'mon homies give it up
(DPG {G}, C)
I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, I'm Neva Gonna Give It Up (DPG {G}, C)
Neva Gonna Give It Up
C'mon homies give it up

(Verse Two: Warren G, Nate Dogg *singing*)

(Warren G)

What I'mma do, I'mma bang on the beat
What I'mma do, cain't cock and serve heat
You lookin' at me, I'm scopin' on you
But you don't know my shit is right nigga, so fuck you
Everybody talkin' 'bout Money Ain't A Thang
Everybody talkin' 'bout how they gangbang
If you was hard as me, I'm as hard as you
Cutthroats and bud smoke, I'm an Eastside loc
So don't let the crossover fool ya
I been down since '81, LB top gun biyatch
