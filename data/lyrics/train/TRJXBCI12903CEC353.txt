And away we go
and I hope that you know
that one day, we will all be alone

Holding on to broken hearts
Memories are what's left of us
You're trying to hard to be my friend
And I'm placing all our pictures
in these broken frames to remind me never fall in love again

I'm sorry wont cut it for the rest of your life
get over yourself and say goodbye
I hope you realize you threw away the best thing that ever happened to you
Forget my name and forget my face hope you get on a plane and forget this place
