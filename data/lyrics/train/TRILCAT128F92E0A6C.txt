It's not what they call you, it's what you answer to 

Just because I'm suffering through and through 
Yeah, I've been floating my whole life 
The only thing you've done to me 
Is partening us to make me stronger 

I'm like a newborn child that you have never seen 
Like a newborn child that you have never believed 

It's not what they call you, it's what you answer to 
You're suffering through and through 
You make me dissolve 

Dissolve 
Dissolve 
Dissolve 
You make me dissolve 
...
