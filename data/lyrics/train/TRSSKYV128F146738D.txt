I know what you're thinkin' about
I know what you're thinkin' about
I know what you're thinkin' about work
I know what you're thinkin' about school
I know what you're thinkin' about all the time

And I may be greasin' the wheels in a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines

I work so hard tryin' to make a few bucks
I pass the hours in a dream
The sweat keeps rollin' off the tip of my nose
There's only one thing, keeps me on my feet

I may be greasin' the wheels in a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines
Watching the gears as they move
...
