Planted in the sweet spot for the sound
that keeps us sleeping safe 'til dawn
you fit yourself for cracks to slip into
i fit myself for exits and i'm gone
Repeat times ten
we're happy again
sinking where you lay
Window envelopes and monotone
claim your prize it's overdue
it takes a nerve to claim the intellect
to crane your neck out of a cushioned tomb
...
