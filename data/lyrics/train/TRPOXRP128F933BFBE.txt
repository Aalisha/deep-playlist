This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven, 
this could be heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection (reflection)
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, 
this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, 
this world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
