I'm the one who makes mistakes
I'm the one who can't say sorry
I get bored far too easily and
I watch TV 'cause I'm lazy

I'm the one who says goodbye
I'm the one who doesn't have the time
I get bored far too easily and
I watch TV 'cause I'm lazy

I want to be the one
Who can dance without
Getting drunk
I get bored far too easily and
I keep repeating the same things

I'm the one who knows the truth
...
