When you say it's dead and gone
Yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
...
