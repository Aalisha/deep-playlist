Wearing robes of solemnity
My senses stand erect
This moment I am solitary
As you watch me, eyeless
Observe a brutal face
I need silence, I need to be alone
Look at me; my bony fingers
Wrapped in rags; I am pursued
And love is withered
My eyes will see, if my spirit lives
And love is withered
And love is withered
And love is withered
And love is withered

The wind shouts it's commands
The earth has stopped my ears
...
