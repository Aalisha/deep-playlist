Torn like an old dollar bill
Girl let them say what they will
That no one should hurt you
And that's all I seem to do
That no one should desert you
And that's all I seem to do

I got to tell you, goodbye mama
We've taken this too far
Been trying to tell you what's going on
Trying to make it easy on you
Trying to make it better
Make it easier on you
It's all I came to do
It's all I came to do
...
