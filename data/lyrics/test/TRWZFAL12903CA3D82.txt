Once again you try, but again you fail
You feel the blood on your hands and all the tears you shed
The needle stings within seconds they're gone
A life so easily ended, but is this really right and not wrong

The illusion of a better world, without the pain of losing
Everything must come to an end
It's just a matter of time before we all have to go
A step further into the dawn of a new era
...
