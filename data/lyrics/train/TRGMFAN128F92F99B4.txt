It's not yet 6
The sun's not up
And father take away this cup is running through my throbbing head
Because if he had I'd be dead
Feeling like I'm feeling now
In between the skies and clouds
Where everyone's identity is just a picture card they need

I came from California with an appetite for my own myths
Of music, love, and what they mean
I'm told it's borderline obscene
I tried to write this song before
But had no one to write it for
My fellow travelers vacant stares leave it up for you to care
