You held his head in your hands
And looked at me with your cold eyes
"This is the place where it ends"
And talked me into break ice

I lost all things that I loved
One million things I still love

- Cold water taste like metal
- Knifes will get under your skin
- Light shimmers in your white cloth
- One of two sisters must win
...
