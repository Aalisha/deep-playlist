Hello, hello it's me again
You're still not home
'Cause if you were, it's after 4 a.m.
I wouldn't be here alone, see

God, give me the strength
And the courage I need
What my heart lives for
Have to let it be

But it's okay, I understand
(You've got to leave)
I don't cry no more, baby, what for?
(You don't shed a tear for me)
See, I was blind but now I see

There's gotta be a better man for me
There's gotta be a better man for me

Hello, oh, no, not this again
I'll be counting down
