In thoughts from visions of the night,
When deep sleep falleth out of sight.
Many a strange thing will you dream -
Though it is never what it seems

Awakened from my troubled sleep -
Where dreams once lost as
Nightmares creep,
To steal my soul and suffocate
What sanity remains.
My anger mute -
My anguish blind
Within this sad fragmented mind,
Your eyes the spark to light fire
That burns away my pain.

Protected by reality-
Yet you still fear the beast in me,

Your reckless tongue could be the key,
You'll be the first to die
If it breaks free.

Alone tonight-
Myself and I,
On raven wings our spirits fly.
All hope has fallen out of sight,
Without the wit or will to fight.
I face up to my destiny-
You'll see another side to me,
A love that dare not speak it's
Name is born tonight of sweat and
Flame and ...

Wildfire - hallucinations
Fill my mind with
Wildfire - a love so strong
That it is blind.
