(tsk.why you gotta act like that?)

When I say that I love you, you ask me what I want
When I try to care for you woh-o hoa, you say I'm tryin' to front
When I'm tryin' to listen to you oh ho baby, you take it as a joke
And when I try to give you good advice yeah yeah, you swear that I don't know

So what the hell do you want? Uhn, Baby?
What the hell do you want, from me?
What the hell do you want, I need to know
What the hell do you want, baby
What the hell do you want from me
