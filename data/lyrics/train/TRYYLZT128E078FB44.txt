Man:
We have come here from all over the world
because society has no futher use for you
This place
Will now be your home and land until the death
It's very good, this place
Because I make all the rules
But if you break any of my rules
You'll find there is' life after death.

Patience is how I'm living today
I lie before you stressing me out again
My life is twisted, twisted like your own brains
I can't accept that, I can't accept that again.

Yeah, face it
No, try it
Yeah, immune to what you are.
