Willie Deadwilder

(Lyrics written by Chan Marshall / Music written by M. Ward)
Bonus track included on Speaking for Trees bonus CD

Willie Deadwilder and Rebecca
They knew that they loved one another
He said fuck this cabby life
She said fuck this old trailer
He said I want you for my wife

Willie Deadwilder and Rebecca
They saw the same things at once
They shared the kind of stuff everybody dreams of
Finding out about, it's all about love

Willie Deadwilder and Rebecca
They got a few more years to go
Gonna have some good old times
No more sad, sad bad times
It's all that they've been waiting for
Someone to knock at the door
I tell you there are some people living alone
There are some people with nowhere to go
There are some people who don't believe in love
But Willie and Rebecca prove them all wrong

First time I saw him he smiled at me
And the first time I saw her she was beautiful
Sixty-two plus forty-six equals one hundred and eight
Possible years they'll live long to
That's almost half of the rest of his life
That's over half for her

Willie was shot once in his mind
His cry out saved his life
Second time through the heart
The doctor pulled the bullet from inside
He had a job to do, he thought
That's his way of life
To take that car and pick her up
To be a man for her
Broken down and cut in two
She had been married for most her life
Now she's finally free for awhile

Long enough to see this man and what he means
When he tells her that God in on his side
No matter what, and will you marry me

Willie Deadwilder and Rebecca
They want to live a life
I wish I had a million dollars
So we could throw it all away
I wish I had a million dollars
So we could light it aflame
I wish I had one million dollars
So we could spend it every day

I'm on the same side as you
I'm just a little bit behind
And please don't bring me down
Please don't let me go
I'm looking for a new kind of thing
A place that makes my heart sing
