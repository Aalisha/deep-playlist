As a singer or a song
Trying to change my mind
Trying to push me over
One way or another
To release me or to smother
It's hard to remember what I want
To love me or don't bother
It's hard to remember what I want

As a movie or a show
Influencing my morals
It's a feeling It is stronger
Than lust or love itself

I am sorry
If I hurt you
I had run out of my pills
I am sorry
If I failed you
I had run out of my pills

I am sorry
If I hurt you
I had run out of my pills
I am sorry
If I failed you
I had run out of my pills
