The things that run in my blood
I just gave up so fast I've got nothing left to give and
Secrets don't keep themselves
I'm sick of hiding the answer from the question here
What did I find in my head?
Had no conviction and the fire, that had gone out
That little went, the radio signal went too

Is this the end of the world?
I can't tell
It's been like this so long
Is this still you by my side?
I can't decide
If you were here at all
Is this the end of the world?
