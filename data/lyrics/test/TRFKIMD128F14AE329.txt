Well, I'm living with a power
And I have never felt this way before
Oh, my mind is thinking clearly now
The chains are broken and I'm standing tall

Oh, the Lord has never left me
He's always there to catch me when I fall

I believe in Jesus
Oh, he's Lord of Lords and King of Kings
And I believe in Jesus
He rescued me
