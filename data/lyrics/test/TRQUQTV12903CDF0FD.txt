Well, I know a cool cat from way downtown
He's been boppin' all around
In this ole world he's livin' fast
Someday I'm afraid he's gonna run outta gas
So if you're travelin' that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do.

Chorus:
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way.
