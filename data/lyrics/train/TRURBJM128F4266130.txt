They ain't ready for this one
Nivea
Rasheeda
Kenya

He like the way my pinkie sitting pretty
Underneath my mini, I'm ready for a quickie
Give him a quick striptease, drop it low
Let him squeeze, what my B's like some double D's

Only got a few minutes I can play with
Show him how us ghetto girlz like to get it, get it
I ain't pimpin', I see your body out of tension
So come and get it 'cuz I'm working with a time limit

Give it up, give it up, quick to me
I gotta run, can we make this kinda quick you see
Give me your love like you always do it to me
(I need your love but we gotta rush)

Keep it low, shine low, not too loud
Do it all, make it fast, know I like it round
Make me scream like a witness on a murder scene
(Won't you come and break me off right here)

It can be outside on the hood of your truck
It can be how you want it, just hurry up
Hit it up, put it down
Till you get enough

I'm feenin' for your touch
(Touch)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
Not tryin' to be nasty
I just want a quickie

I'm feenin' for your touch
(Oh oh)
I just can't get enough
Come get all of my love
