I'm gonna do it all tomorrow
Tomorrow that'll be the day
So if you need me tomorrow
You might find me while i'm going bout my way.

Yo I get up, put my drawers on slow-mo action
It's a fine day, smiling at my lady what's happenin
Yo perhaps we should kick ahead, tickle and giggle and guess again
always spliffin, put that shit in the air
(Then disappear)
Thats quality time, playin with this dolly of mine
Keepin it solid with a bottle of wine
We design a mo'bettah life, never forget it
We get it right cuz were both bein' incredible tight
And its like, a shagalightnin cuz livin and lovin bring the excitement
Im sick of this fuzzing and fighting
(So allright then)
Just keep it cool
Knowing the evil that people do we'll be better off sleepin like fools
(So we role up another one)
Keepin our focus, I fought a shelf just like the broke and the wealth,
For another son
(I see a whole world come and dawn)
Keepin a reefer in my lungs cuz livin is easy where I'm from

I'm gon' do it all tomorrow
Tomorrow that'll be the day
So if you need me tomorrow
You might find me while i'm going bout my way.
But today, I'm just gonna take it easy
I aint gon' do a thing at all
See, I'm just happy to be breathin
