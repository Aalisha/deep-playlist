As i lay alone in bed, clock says 3am
Once again can't sleep coz you're not their right by my side
So many thoughts run through my head of me and you
And i wonder if you're thinkin about me too
Do you dream about me when you go to sleep at night
And do you wonder if i'm gonna be alright

Chorus
I just wanna spend one night with you
And i wanna order in for two
I don't wanna be alone no more
