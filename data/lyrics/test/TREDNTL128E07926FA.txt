What is the purpose?
Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux
So get it on
Loose upon the world
Destruct like a juggernaut

Give it to me! Yeah! Yeah!

Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses watch them cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog

Iron Head
Iron Head
Iron Head
Crucify you

Iron head - regenerate!
