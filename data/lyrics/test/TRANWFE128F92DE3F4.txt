I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOUâ€™LL EVER KNOW
Kooper

If I ever leave you
You can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you babe
You know I hurt myself as well
Chorus: Is that any way for a man to carry on
d'you think he wants his little loved one gone?
I love you Baby, more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know
When I wasn't makin' too much money
you know where my paycheck went
you know I brought it home to baby
and I never spent one red cent
