Remember you told me how the good will fall 
Well talk is cheap but I remember it all 
You kissed my cheek yeah I admit 
It turned my head just a little bit 

I see your picture now everywhere 
Collins Bay down to Reading Square 
You say good luck to the people you meet 
You never set foot on any of their streets 

That was the day that we rode together 
Times like that are now gone forever 
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon 
C'mon down with us 
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon 
...
