I met you in a record store
You had slept in the clothes you wore
But I knew I'd seen you somewhere before

What happened to your guitar?
And what happened to the prettiest star?
Can you still play the songs that got you so far?

Hey, you, with your shadow in the gutter
How low have you gotta go before you're through?
High times and vodka in the morning
All your memories are coming out of your shoes

Black dog sitting in the park
Odd looks from the brothers of the devil's own
Shoplifting, getting your essentials
...
