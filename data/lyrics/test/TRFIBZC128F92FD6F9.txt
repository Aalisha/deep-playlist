Teach me teach me how to shoot
(teach me teach me how to shoot)
how to stand up straight in my boots
(how to stand up straight in my boots)
teach me teach me how to handle a gun
(teach me teach me how to handle a gun)
fire fire bang bang that's so fun
(fire fire bang bang that's so fun)

these guns are made for firing
and that's just what they'll do
one day these guns are gonna spread their fire over you

Gun!
Gun!
Gun!
Shoot - shoot
