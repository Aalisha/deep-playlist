To the left. To the right. 
We think we're okay. 
We walk we talk. 
Forget where we're going. 
We lose our way.

We love we laugh.
We act like we're happy,
if just for a day.

Now times have changed
so don't be fooled.
You got to remember you gotta be cool.

There's too many voices you can't control.
You better think twice before you're too old. 

It's a great life if you don't weaken.
I paid a high price for all I've done wrong. 
It's a great life if you don't weaken.
