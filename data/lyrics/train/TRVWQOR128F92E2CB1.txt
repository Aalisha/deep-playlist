Don't don't ask me to explain
I've already told you
More than words could never say
Every time I hold you
When you're happy when you're sad
Through the good times and the bad
No matter what you do I'm hanging on and on and on

refrain:
And if an angel comes my way I'm gonna try to catch her if I can
Do anything to get her to stay, baby that's the way I am
