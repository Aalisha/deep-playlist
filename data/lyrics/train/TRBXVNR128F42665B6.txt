Space children
Universal love
Space children
Are there any of us
You better take a look if youâ€™re in love

You may be flying
Through the year
Wrapped up in how high you can go
And no one will be there to bring you down
So stop, take a look around

Space children
Universal love
Space children
Are there any of us
You better take some time and shake it up
