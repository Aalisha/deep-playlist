(DavenportCooley)
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a Fever that's so hard to bear

You give me Fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
The moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right

You give me Fever
