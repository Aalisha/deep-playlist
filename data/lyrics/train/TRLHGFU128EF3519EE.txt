Shake the ground (Ah, yeah)
Shake the ground
Shake the ground
Shake the ground

I've been waitin' while you've been livin'
How do I think get through to you
Oh, my body's shakin', anticipatin'
Tryin' to figure out the truth, yeah, hmm

Baby, I've got to move {Ooh}
‘Cause I'm tired of watchin' you
And I can't slow down
Or keep my feet on shaky ground, woo, woo

Slow down (Slow, baby)
‘Cause I can't take the heat (Mmm)
Ooh, slow down, baby

Slow down (Can't stop the haeat)
‘Cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, hoo

Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Is this the part oh, no}
Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
{Is this the part} (Don't wipe your feet on me, mmm-mmm)
