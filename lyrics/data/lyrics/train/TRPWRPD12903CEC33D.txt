There's something strange going on in my head
That says if I were to get in a car right now
North Carolina is where I would end
And to your doorstep I would be bound.
To whisper the words that I've always wanted to say,
And watch as the sun rips this blue sky away
Cause the colors are always changing
So stare up at the clouds
And at least you know
you're always looking up

So Casey can you remember
sitting by my side
On the bank of the Delaware River
and talking about life

Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
...
