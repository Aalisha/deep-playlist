I love Love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me

Take these tattered boxes
that used to hold your clothes
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones
All you did was construct a mess
You're good to me when only flesh
You're a memory with nothing to show

When we would take trips
We swore we'd never take pictures
Pictures only prove you can't convince
Now i wsh those photographs
could convince you that what we had
would only turn out a negative

well
well
well

If fingertips are relationships
then i could barely carry your weight
If fingers are mistakes
Don't use this one to point the blame
Just sing
sing

I love love
I love being in love
...
