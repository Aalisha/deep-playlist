One, two, three, four!

I said no, no never
We don't go together
Oh, I really couldn't take anymore
Now it's two weeks later
I feel such a traitor
Oh, I let you in my back door

You're the one who's creeping
Rough love's so deceiving
I said never again but here we are
A pure, pure sweetness
You're my only weakness
I said never again but here we are

Now, I don't rush in
I bite my lip and let you know
I really like the game you play
I'd be better off without you
But I can't live without you
