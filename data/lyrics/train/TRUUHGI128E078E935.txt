You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here

If I had time to think about it
I'd build a castle in the yard
For all the things I want so much
