We used to talk
Enough to fill an ocean
Full of sailors who were going
To some undiscovered place
And we talked
About a storm that's growing
But we'd survive it knowing
We'd keep each other safe
Like the waves
That wash away
The footprints on the shore
We used to talk a lot
But we don't talk much anymore
...
