Where are you walking to
There's a trapdoor straight ahead falling through
What are you gonna do, gonna do

Visions of us on the wall
Sisters spellbound in the hall
House is dark and everybody's happy

Close my eyes to the dawn
There's a wheel of destruction coming on
It's all we never said, ever said
