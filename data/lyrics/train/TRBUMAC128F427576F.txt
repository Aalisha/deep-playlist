Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die
But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes

Time has gone since I've been with you
We've been starting to lie
Now it seems you don't care for me
and I don't understand why
