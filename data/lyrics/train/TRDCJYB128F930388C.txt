Took a car to the part of the city
Where the city runs out of street lights
God knows, it's the way that it goes
That we're never gonna catch any daylight

My little sister's eyes so wide
Must have been the size of the city

Did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
Did you get the real good ones
Did you get the good ones
