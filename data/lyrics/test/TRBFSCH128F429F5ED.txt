(S. McClusky/D.Wayne)

He's got all you could ever want
He's got the purpose & the style
He's got such an open mind
He's got the walk you'd never find
He's got the roughness in his voice
He's got... my one & only choice
He's got a sweet & tender voice
He's got... but most of all he's got

Sex on his mind
Seems to me he wants sex all the time
I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind
And when he wants it he gets sex all the time

He's got a taste for everything
He gives the kind of state the morning brings
