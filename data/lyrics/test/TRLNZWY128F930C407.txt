I've been struggling for so many years now
Aiming high, yet shooting low
My biography is like a looking glass
There's someone I don't know
Always asking me about my destiny
Spoken anger without words
On an empty street without life and joy
No sunlight to shine bright

Unfold the blueprint - your key to existence
A master plan for life - just play your cards right
Broken wings won't fly

The more adrenaline, the higher I fly
Without quest I find no rest
...
