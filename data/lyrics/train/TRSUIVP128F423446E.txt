i go from city to city, coast to coast
highways and byways lord i'm healin' to post (?)
i got to roll just like a tumbleweed
i gotta roll where the four winds blow, just like a
tumbleweed

i got everything i own in a brown paper sack
keep it stashed by the railroad track
i got to roll just like a tumbleweed
i gotta roll where the four winds blow, just like a
tumbleweed

baby i'm a drifter, i'm a vagabond
