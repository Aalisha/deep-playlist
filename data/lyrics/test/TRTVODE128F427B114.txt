Woooooooo
Aaaaaaaah (x 8)

There are people who are pushing me on the train
Screaming from the top of buildings
"youre gonna get whats coming"
And i dont know how to react
Or if i should fight back

He could have a knife
Stab me in the gut
Bleeding on the floor
Shoulda kept my mouth shut

And i dont know how to react
...
