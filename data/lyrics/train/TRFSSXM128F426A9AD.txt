She was the dawn of a new day
The crystal voice inside my head
And at times she showed me Eden
Untrodden paths, a sky that's bleeding
Serpent's embrace
Serpent's embrace
Darkness waiting in her eyes
Her gaze, kissed by a fraudulent snake
A soul eater, serpent's embrace
Serpents embrace
She was the dawn of a new day
But all it brought was pure dismay
...
