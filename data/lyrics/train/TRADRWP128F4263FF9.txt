If the rebel in me
Can touch the rebel in you
And the rebel in you
Can touch the rebel in me
And the rebels we be
Is gonna set us free
Then it would bring out the rebel
Bring out the rebel
Bring out the rebel in me
If the lover in you
Can touch the lover in me
And the lover in me
Can touch the lover in you
And the lovers we be
Will bring sweet harmony
Then it would bring out the love
Bring out the love
Bring out all the love in me
My love
Is deeper than the ocean
Our love
