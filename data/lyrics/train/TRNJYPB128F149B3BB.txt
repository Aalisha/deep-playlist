Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter.

Someday yeah, we'll put it together and we'll get it undone
Someday when your head is much lighter
Someday yeah, we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun
Someday when the world is much brighter.
