1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in

I just can't justify your love
?
I'm just too scared to watch tv
Cause in the glass, static's all I see
Melted faces
And in the mirror speaking tongues
As I hear a siren travelin' by
I can't wake up, I try and I try

Everybody sugar in my bed
Everybody clouds up in my head
Everybody disastrous
Everybody all after us
Everybody everybody everybody everybody...
