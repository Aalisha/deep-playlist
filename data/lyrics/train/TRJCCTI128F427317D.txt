Fortunately you have got
Someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in
the symptoms are so deep
It is much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign you name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
...
