I tried to run away but I'm frozen in place
My body is made of sawdust and my heart just split
My old friend Rigor Mortis starts to breathe in my face
The air starts to drain out of my spirit

Help me, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?

A century of my tears wouldn't even fill a thimble
The war of the class clown is never won
But nothing makes me laugh anymore and nothing makes me cry
...
