Hey
little girl get your dancing shoes.
Your gold satin jacket and the silvery blues.
And it'll be alright
dancing on a Saturday night.
On well the jukebox a' playin' like a one man band.
It's the only kind of music
girl we both understand.
We're gonna be alright
dancin' on a Saturday night.
We'll the roller coaster
gotta make the most and dance.
Dance
