There is a wait and that's what hurt
Makes it happen, fill the gap
It spreads her hair all about
My steps
If I do it slow

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

I hurry back to make him feel Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
I have to make him feel better Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
And oh, I know, no I can't
Freshness
You amaze me

No, no threats
...
