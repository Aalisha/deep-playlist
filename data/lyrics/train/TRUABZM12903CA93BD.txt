always knew that when we said good bye
it wouldn't last forever
always thought that i'd run into you
and we'd get back together
now your here
just like i imagined
but never once did it cross my mind
that you could move on
you've found someone
it breaks my heart
cuz you're so in love

i wish that my touch makes you smile just like that
and i wish that i had you the way that she has
cuz i still remember the love i left behind
oh i wish i was her and you were mine

i think somebody's try'na talk to me
but i can't hear what they're saying
all i can do is stare at you
i don't even know why i'm staying
never thought i'd cry to see you happy
