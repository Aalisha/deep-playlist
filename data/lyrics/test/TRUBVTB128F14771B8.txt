Bitch I see you, cause you know I know you
Yeah I know you.

Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me
I was P-I to the motherfucking M-P WHAT!
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch livin in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out BUT!
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacan't lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Fuck's wrong with this nigga man?
He used to bring her through the hood
Treat the bitch to fuckin good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch, faded off the lick she x-rays the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
Meanwhile in the hood she drivin around good
