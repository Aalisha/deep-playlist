I feel so helpless now, my guitar is not around
And I'm struggling with the xylophone to make these feelings sound
And I'm remembering you singing and bringing you to life
And it's raining out the window and today it looks like night

You haven't written to me in a week, I'm wondering why that is
Are you too nervous to be lovers-- friendships ruined with just one kiss
I watched you very closely and I saw you look away
Your eyes are either gray or blue, I'm never close enough to say

But your sweatshirt says it all with the hood over your face
And I can't keep staring at your mouth without wondering how it tastes
And I'm with another boy, he's asleep, I'm wide awake
...
