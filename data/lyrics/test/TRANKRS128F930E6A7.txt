Let the dust settle, step on the pedal
See the sun set but I'm, never gonna settle
For less than three hundred miles an hour in the chest
Burn the track, this is only a test

I'm the leader of the pack
My is that...
Number one is no Mathias rap
Don't try this at home little brother
Been doing it for years tearing up the rubber

There's thunder on the race track, fire in the sky
Anticipation and sweat in your eye
We letting it fly now, get up from your seat
Pumping up adrenaline and feeling the heat

Back in the pits the girls celebrate
Who the man? Straight to the getaway van
Never made plans, hands where the game is
Hear the people scream tell them what my name is

Coconut grove, one hell of a heat
Late roam to a party down Melbourne Street
There's five lanes, five bad brothers
Gonna migrate on your highway
Runners of gaming, at nine AM to the pavement
I'm on the new town by noon
