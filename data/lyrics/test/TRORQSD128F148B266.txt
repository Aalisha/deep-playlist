Yeah
Ha yo, ha yo
Ha yo, ha yo
Ha yo

Yeah
Locked in the basement
I'm so paranoid
I'm all encased
And I can't escape
And when I look up, mothers lookin' down
And when I wake up, mothers not around

'Cause if you want, you can have
Everything that I've got
'Cause if you want
You can take it all away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me

Nobodies perfect, but you just can't see
My life's a circus, that you don't believe
...
