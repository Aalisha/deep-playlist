Just as the stars illuminate the sky,
the heart of God has expressed the beauty of love
before the beginning of time.

How can I resist such tender love
Deeper than the deep blue sea
Love as constant as the morning tide
Let You love wash over me
Let You love wash over
How can I resist such gentle love
...
