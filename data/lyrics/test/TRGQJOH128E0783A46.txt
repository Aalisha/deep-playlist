I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
...
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
...

May you never take one single breath for granted
...
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
...
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean

...
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
...
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance

...
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
...
I hope you dance, I hope you dance

...
