Got some needs yeah, I need to shake it
And I can razamataz you honey, if you want me to
I can be your daddy, be your rock n' rolla'
You can be my sugar, be my cherry cola
Got some needs yeah, I need to shake it

Cherry cola
Cherry cola
Cherry cola
Cherry cola

I'm so real I don't need to fake it
Here's your chance now you need to take it
