One, two, three, four, one

I could be with anyone
Just while the honeymoon burns bright
No electricity that keeps things light
I'm not saying that it's right
I'm not saying that it's always right
I'm just saying that it's not a lie.

'Cause I can talk to anyone
Care just enough about our wounded pride
A ballerina dreams a lead foot life
