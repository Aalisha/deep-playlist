If you've got the cheek and wanna be awefully, awefully neat
and wanna be taken to your seat you'd better consider.
If you want to sell and wanna be awefully, awefully swell
and wanna be at the Ritz Hotel where you'll be bigger.

Big shot - they tell me that's what I could be
But it's - momentarily
You know it's - momentarily
They put you in a wigwam
And make you do it on a programme on T.V.
