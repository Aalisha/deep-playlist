I should've been a better man
Instead of wastin' time
Spendin' my life
Searching for the finer things
Oooooh
You always gave me another chance
To make it right
But I didn't deserve
'Cause I didn't understand
And I feel so bad
'Cause you wouldn't do the same to me
But I know what your weakness is, is, is
And you feel so mad
And now you're on an open road
So gone, not looking back, back, back
I thought I had you on a leash
Like I could do whatever I wanted to when I wanted to
And you was gonna wait for me baby
Noooo ohhh
