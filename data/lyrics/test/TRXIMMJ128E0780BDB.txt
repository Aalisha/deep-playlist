When we first meet I was drawn to you
Attracted to your style your brand new suit
Didn't take that long to fall in love
Built this bond it became so strong
But as time passes changes are visible
Work more often and lately busy too
Wondering whats goin'on
What's taking up your time
My friend sayings that your cheating
Should I read the signs

(Chorus)
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Your time
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
simply your time, all I want is your time,
