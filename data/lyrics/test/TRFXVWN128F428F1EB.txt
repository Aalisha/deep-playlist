Sleep while you wake me with these dreams you bring
Dreams came to me where I lay
And deep the melody the wild waves sing
My love is far, far away

Chorus (after each verse):
Oh and pity the hearts the wild waves part
My love sails the bonny boat, the Bergen

They heap their nets upon the decks by moonlight
Dreams came to me where I lay
...
