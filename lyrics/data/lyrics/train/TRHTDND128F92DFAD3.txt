I'll bring my love to you
I'll bring my love to you

Ive been stood up messed around
And taken for a fool
But next time round
I'm gonna change the rules
And I don't care about the things that people say
It's you I think about each and everyday
It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, and I'll be around

Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
...
