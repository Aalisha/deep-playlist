Don't, Don't close your heart to how you feel
Dream Don't be afraid the dream's not real
Close your eyes Pretend it's just the two of us again
Make believe This moment's here to stay
Touch - Touch me the way you used to do
I know Tonight could be all I'll have with you
From now on You'll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight Let's build this memory...
and for the last time

Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word
Just hold me now
...
