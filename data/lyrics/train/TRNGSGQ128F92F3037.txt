would wake warriors great
Summon warriors of the oak
High as a pine in the forest
Summon those who sleep
Wake those beneath the grass
Buried deep under fields

In the burning earth

Carve runes upon the horns
Stain them red with blood
We mumble our spells and sing our hymns
Filled with lust we drink
The mead so pure and strong
Proffered by smiling maidens
