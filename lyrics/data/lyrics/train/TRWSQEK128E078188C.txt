I first saw you
Without love and then you knew
Your fingers reached
I moved in the distance breached

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here
To my surprise
I kissed you, you made me rise
Now by my side
I've missed you and let it slide

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here
If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the thing that I said, they just weren't true
Ascend, ascend my friend
