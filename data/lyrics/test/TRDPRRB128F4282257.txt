I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the Light
I saw the Light, I saw the Light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the Light
Just like the blind man, I wandered along
Worries and fears, I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the Light
I saw the Light, I saw the Light
