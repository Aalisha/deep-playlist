One nation under God family owned and operated
Resist! Protest!
These colors may not run
But they sure seem like they're faded
Resist! Protest!
Land of opportunity?
But not for you and me
Is this how it has to be?
Don't need no revolution
Don't need to retribution
We got a problem with an obvious solution
Disarm and put away your pride
Patriotic ego yet we struggle to survive so
Cease Fire, how many have to die before we learn?
