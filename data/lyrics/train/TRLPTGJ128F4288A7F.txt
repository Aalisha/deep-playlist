I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's no one else around

I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am, oh, yes I am
One more thing I just want to say right here

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
...
