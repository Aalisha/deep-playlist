Allah kow da
ballawy
Allah kow da massifa
Allah kow da asaba
Dek da ballaway hak de massifa
I believe in money, I need some money
I have to be able to feed myself from this
occupation
Singing is my occupation from my father's
generation
My uncle is a welder but not in Julius Berger
Oga mei V boot, oga mai Honda, wetin become to
hardi
I need that money, give me that money
Before I lose my temper
Come and give the promise my people free
education
And free medication, but no occupation
It is only sufferation that leads to my aggression
My frustration
Oga have mercy, have mercy to our people
