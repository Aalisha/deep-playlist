A table of the deranged, this savage brutal being
A shocking way of life living on human offspring
Murder of the innocent, his pale grey face expresionless
Horrid dismemberment
One persons tortures, is anothers pleasure
Malformation, a diseased brain
Unsuspecting slowly dying, as his knife invades
The child, screams of pain, no one hears
Blood splotches now appear, esctasy through
Each cut, now the body twiches the gutted
Little torso ready to be cooked
Isolated in his own mind the need to kill
