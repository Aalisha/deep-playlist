All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
I gave you all my love that I had in me
Now that I've found you've lied, I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in his arms, I see you across the street
I can't help but wonder if he knows what's going on
You talk about that love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

You'd better stop before you tear me all apart
