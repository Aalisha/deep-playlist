In so many ways, I'm the same as you
In so many things better left unsaid
From out of the deep well the water flows into the sea

And that's the way it starts
And continues to unfold
But to both of us
That will never change

And we're staring at each other
Like the banks of a river
And we can't get any closer

I won't give control to anyone
...
