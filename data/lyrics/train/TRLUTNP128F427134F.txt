looking back at times
always been the great pretender...
a master in disguise
I see my darkest days
and summer slides into December
and long cold nights
cuz something good can end up bad
and we start to fall - and we burn out fast
It's much too late to save us now
I couldn't break your fall
I couldn't see at all
I hate the chemicals between us
...
