Ten boots, a-battered and a-beaten
Holes in our soles where the desert has eaten
But they're holdin' out and they're so easy fittin'
Just a few holes where the rattlesnakes have bitten

They ain't too fancy and they're just a little dirty
But they mean a lot to us, we think they're awful purty
We wear 'em all the time from morning to night
If you wanna take 'em from us then you're in for a fight

No, we wouldn't trade for whiskey or a lover
They've taken us further than either of the other
And when we're gone, we won't be a-carin'
Six feet under, you know what we'll be wearin', wearin'
...
