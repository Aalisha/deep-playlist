If you were here with me
We could hold hands while we're walking
Or ride the subway, miss our stop
Cuz we're too busy talking
If you were here with me
We could go to shows together
Dance around like a couple of jerks
And if they stare, who cares?
We've got each other
We could have sleepovers all of the time
You could use my toothbrush, I wouldn't mind
We'd watch Cartoon Network and dye our hair
