it's time that we started believing
we've all got a place in the world
so why can't we harness the feeling
that lies deep inside of us all?

well here comes the end of the century
and what are we thinking of?
it's time to stop fighting your enemy
and offer some friendship and hope, peace, and love

rock to the rhythm of love
take a ride on the rhythm of love
rock to the rhythm of love
take a ride on the rhythm of love
...
