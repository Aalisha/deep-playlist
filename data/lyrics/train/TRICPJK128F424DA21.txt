never lost someone i've trusted
people are lying every day
people lying or just leaving
safer distance away
on and on and on i've been re-routed
angry for so long i'm losing faith again
giving in to friends they make me crowded
angry when they always go away
so you won't have to tell me now i guess
not with everybody here
i feel safer when i'm lonelier than this
...
