Uhuu!

Yeah!
So come on and so chikity
Check yo self before you wreck yo self (shit)
Yeah! (shit)
Yeah! (shit)
You better check yo self before you wreck yo self

Cos I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth

Droppin bombs on ya moms, fuck car alarms
Doin foul crime, I'm that nigga wit'cha Alpine
Sold it for a six - o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No I'm not a sucker, sittin in a House of Pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya (Uh!)
Headbutt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, in fact mothafuck ya
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough but don't call me DoughBoy
This ain't no fuckin motion picture
A guy or bitch - a, I'll get wit'cha
And hit ya, takin that yack to the neck
So you better run a check
So come on and chickity - check yo self before you wreck yo self
