If I stand too close I might fall in
But if I’m too far gone I’ll never win
If you believe in me I might just want to spend some time with you again
I’m afraid I tend to disappear into an anxious state when you draw near
There is no reasoning it’s quite a silly thing
But it’s the way I’ve been for years
So I will understand if you don’t stay
They say I’m great at first but then the magic fades
Into an awful hue of dismal views and pessimistic attitude

All this distance
Years of sweet resistance
Swirling over head
...
