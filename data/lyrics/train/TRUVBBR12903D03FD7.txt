oh yes

this is a serious time
violence and crime
and a bare gun thing di youths dem have pon dem mind
ohhh
dem buss it when rain a fall
yuh nuh see seh dem nuh care dem ya youth
buss it all when sun a shine
oh ohhh

(verse 1)
yuh no see
you no see a bare juvenile
a lock up di big guns outta street (and dem a buss it up buss it up)ohhhh
weh dem get it from
nobody know
dem fadda was a killah
well a see tun and grow
