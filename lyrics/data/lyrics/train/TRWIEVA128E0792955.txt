The key is so distant
I've opened doors
Know when to listen
know what to listen for, yeah

The shelf in the room
has been the way
of holding me
and letting me stay

Kick me out
let me go (go)
I don't belong here no more

A releasing sense
of getting tired
Hold myself, I can't hold myself

The shelf in the room
Has been the way of holding me
and letting me stay
...
