I love pain, I live to fight
Homicide is what I like
Full of anger, and filled with hate
Violent scene makes me feel great
Kill for pleasure, kill for fun
Show no mercy on the helpless one
Run 'em through, until they're dead
Cut the guts out, leave the body lay there

Homicide

Hang the pope, spill his blood
Leave his body lying in the mud
