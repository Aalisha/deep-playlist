Seems like I'm not here, it's like I don't mean nothing
Like glass, I'm clear almost like you can see straight through me
I've got questions, but no answers, so tired of being confused
And I don't wanna stay right here and die, gotta find my wings to fly

I gotta find me another way
'Cause I don't wanna stay another day
Time for a change in my life
I've opened my eyes, I'm changing my life

And now I'm gonna live my life for me
'Cause this ain't how it's supposed to be
No more standing in the back of the line
'Cause I'm invisible for the last time

Why can't you see me? Do I really even matter?
You changed me completely and I remember how it used to be
