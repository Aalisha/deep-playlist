I guess the time is right for us to say
We'd take our time and live our lives
Together day by day
We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
We know our dreams can all come true
With love that we can share

With you I never wonder - will you be there for me?
With you I never wonder - you're the right one for me?
I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime

Forever in my heart
...
