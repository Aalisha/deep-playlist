One in a million (Funk for you baby)
One in a million (Listen it drives you wild) [x4]

[C.L. Smooth]
I'm one in a mil and from the Vernonville
I work it out and wait to get curled
I'm here to sell more joints than "We Are the World"
Flows and old bros and new foes are open and closed shows
So never doze attention, the Mecca's representing
The uptown jazz sound and the chicks start mingling
Now let's watch a flick by John Singleton
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth is in the Mecca house building
Cause this funk is one in a million

One in a million (Funk for you baby)
One in a million (Listen it drives you wild) [x3]

[Pete Rock]
Poetic, energetic rhymes that I'm droppin on ya
