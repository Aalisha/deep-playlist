I'm on my second drink
But I've had a few before
I'm trying hard to think
And I think that I want you on the floor
Uh-huh, yeah on the floor

Go on and take it off (Take it off)
You got to shake it off baby for me
Come on and break me off (Break me off)
Cause I get what I want and I like what I see me

Need your love, one, two, three
