I'm Mister Love
I'll give you all
All of my heart
If you just fall
I'm Mister Love
I'll give you hope
Deep in my heart
There is your home

I'm a rockefeller
I'm no fotune teller
And I know this love is so true
I'm no casanova
Baby if it's over
Oh I know that I'm feeling blue
Give me all your heart girl
There will be no one
Everytime I miss you
My love is so strong

I'm Mister Love
I'll give you all
All of my heart
If you just fall
...
