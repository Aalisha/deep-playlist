In Cuba, each merry maid
Wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts! They're nice and hot
Peanuts! I sell alot
If you haven't got bananas, don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them, no tummy ache
You'll taste them when you awake
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning that whistle blows
Through ev'ry city, town, and country lane
You'll hear him sing his plaintive little strain
And as he goes by to you he'll say:
"Big jumbos, big double ones
Come buy those peanuts roasted today
