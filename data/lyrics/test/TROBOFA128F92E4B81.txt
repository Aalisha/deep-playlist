And this is how it feels when I
Ignore the words you spoke to me
And this is where I lose myself
When I keep running away from you

And this is who I am when
When I Don't know myself anymore
And this is what I choose when
It's all left up to me
Breathe your life into me
I can feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me

I still need you
I'm falling, falling
Breathe into me
