The sun is rising in the sky
Here were waiting, standing by
Round in circles, round and round
Pulse is racing, can't sit down
The noise of people fills the air
Search for silence goes nowhere
Time just passes, starts to rain
I look at you and I feel your pain

Day after day watching it grow, counting the time
In each and every way the pleasure is mine
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
...
