First Verse
Sittin' In The Classroom
Feel Your Heart Goin' Boom
You Start To Get The Feelin'
And Your Head Begins To Reelin'
And Ya Can't Hear What The Teachers Say
Because The News Is Going Down
About The Rock And Roll Dance In Town
And You Know I Just Gotta Hear That Band Play

Chorus
Tonight X 6, Oh Tonight

Second Verse
Well, Tuesday Got The Letter
The Army Thinks I Better
Get Myself Down There Right Away
It's Not That I'm Lazy
I'm Just Too Crazy
