The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians
Who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, then walk out the door
And deny Him by their lifestyle
That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable

What if I stumble? What if I fall?

Is this one for the people? Is this one for the Lord?
Or do I simply serenade for things I must afford?
You can jumble them together
My conflict still remains, holiness is calling
In the midst of courting fame

'Cause I see the trust in their eyes
Though the sky is falling
They need your love in their lives
Compromise is calling

What if I stumble? What if I fall?
What if I lose my step and I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue when my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble? And what if I fall?

What if I stumble? What if I fall?
