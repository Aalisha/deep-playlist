I know what I'm doing may be dumb
I know I should not be staring at the sun
But the thought of it leads me to temptation

It's the same whatever side you're on
Separated we're delicate and small
And the space between leads our retention

I see you right in front of me as close as you can get
And the greater you will lead as a daydream gets

And it might seem much too far to get back to where you are
But it's close enough with an ocean size love
...
