Better stand back, get out of my way,
I'm coming on strong like a burning flame hey hey hey,
I'm hot tonight

Better take it easy don't you get me uptight,
You'll wind up with me swinging 'cause I'm ready to fight hey hey hey,
I'm hot tonight

I was flying high 'till you shot me down,
Were you coming with me when I hit the ground hey hey hey,
I'm hot tonight

Better look out when you ring the bell,
'cause I'm comin' up fast like a bat outta hell hey hey hey,
I'm hot tonight

When I get hot, you know what I like,
I'm curled up like a snake and I am ready to fight hey hey hey,
I'm hot tonight
