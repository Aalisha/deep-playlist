Destroyers in nature
It's just the fabric of us, our mistakes -- feeble-minded
Moderate -- to severe - idiocy
The "most intelligent" creatures on the planet
An advanced civilization, which says nothing at all...
Humans
Like US.
We, the people
We, the morons
Apparently non-educable idiots

We are horrible people

This is a fire
This is the gasoline
Insects attract to the flame
And turn to pitch all the same...

Our presence here -- threatening
...
