i steal the night away
drivin' my life away, dancin'
i was a romeo
i knew the art of romancin'
i was just one of the guys
and i thought i had it made
i needed someone to show me how to love
juliet oh juliet
the night was magic when we first met

juliet, oh juliet
you know you taught me to fly
you take me clear to the sky
and all the people around the world can stand aside
for me and my baby, juliet
...
