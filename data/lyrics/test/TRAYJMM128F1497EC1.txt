I cannot take the take,
Your condition was nod awake
A selfish cryer, boldface liar,
Robbing all of what you could take in

Stabbed towards a death,
A dirty smelling girl
Shit decisions, no provisions,
Filling veins with juice of chaos

Painted face, olive drab, swollen hole,
Empty bag, sunken eyes, whining dog,
It's times like this you should pray for never

I broke your fucking mold
Then threw away the cast,
New religion and new provisions,
It's amazing you're alive

Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
...
