Well these should be the best days of your life
But you worried all the goodness away
And these should be the times you remember the most
But you haven't got the patience today

Down at the station a driver leaves late
Everyone's day is adrift
Well it's a domino effect and it's lost you all respect
So you'd better get your boss a gift
