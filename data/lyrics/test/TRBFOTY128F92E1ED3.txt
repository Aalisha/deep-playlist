Te de da da da da
Hmm, hmm

You run, you run, but this ain't livin'
You wish you could go back
And begin it all over
But it's over

You fight, you fight, you just keep sayin'
You'll feel better come sooner or later
In no time
It's been a long time

You still got made to turn it
You still got made to lift you up

You got wings but you can't fly
You got so much pain inside
You're very kind
In your dreams you're so high
But you don't live that in your life
You're very kind, you're so kind, hmm

Hmm, you do, you do
You love me baby
I can't fight when you leave me lazy
