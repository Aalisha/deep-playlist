If you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the Gospel plow
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Mary had a golden chain
Every link spelt Jesus' name
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Mary had a golden chain, hold on

If you want to get to Heaven let me tell you how
Keep your hand on the Gospel plow

Waking up without you now I'm on my own
