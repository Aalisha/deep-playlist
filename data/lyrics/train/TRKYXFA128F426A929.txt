I always think about you
I always will
I always wonder what might've been
If we could get time to just stand still
Oh well
It was the right train
But I guess we must've been off track
And I've been
waiting for so long
But now I know you're never coming back
CHORUS


So I'll give up giving in
Quit playing this game I can't win
I wish I could stop
But I don't know where to begin
