Open my eyes, welcome the day
Oh, what a night, hungover again
My body still flows, yet I was on fire
I think I made a date but will I keep it

No, I bet I don't 'cause it goes on and on and on
And I never seem to learn
'Cause I'm happy being stuck in my ways
I don't mean to sound a fool but I got plenty things to do
This life is just for living

Too many times I've heard the sweetest lies
They're always sweeter than the truth
I don't really wanna know, oh, let the sun through my window
Never let love leave you blind
