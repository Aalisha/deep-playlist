I overcame my bone structure and metabolism
I made myself engage in mind-numbing conversation
A fad diet left me with skin, bone and bitterness
Starved myself to a petite listening to repetitive electro shit

Prey to the fairies
She got her wish
Tied up and vacuous
She made the switch
Step into her carriage
Put on the ritz
Saliva laced malicious
Skinny little bitch singinâ€™
La la la la la
