Hearts need a beat, like awake needs asleep
like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake
Oh, Yeah!
Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs the time
like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back

Oh, i swear, i know, i believe it, oh
I can't stop hearing all the singin'
Oh my soul has never had this feelin'
it feels like gold

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that i'm talkin' to you
