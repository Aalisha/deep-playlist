Inside I'm frozen
And outside I'm numb
The present is stagnant
The future looks glum
My face is a mask
My heart is a stone
When you broke up, the pain
cut me right to the bone

Monotone, monotone
Monotone, monotone

Separation, isolation, no punctuation, no fluctuation
Separation, isolation, no punctuation, no fluctuation
Separation, isolation
There's no hope of restoration
...
