Out of this time my spirit flies away
I left behind this restless world
Somewhere out there, beyond the horizon
There's my destiny, feelings of grand mystery

Oh, immortality is calling
My soul is searching for peace and harmony

Now I'm heading for the space, to see the light divine
And this journey never ends, it goes on evermore

I past the universe, and stars so bright
In my solitude, out of all pain
...
