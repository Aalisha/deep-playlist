See, i've been through this before
Had about enough, no more
You think i don'tknow, but i know
All my friends been tellin me so

Who you're with, where you go, what you do
When you're not with me
And it's not like i'm gonna sit around
Watin' patiently

Why, oh why you wanna do like that?
Don't you see it's not the level i'm at
I told you once, not gonna tell you again
