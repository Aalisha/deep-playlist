I'm sorry

Last night we had a fight
Said some things I wish I'd never
The black marks from last night
The tears you cried still on my sweater
I step over the plate that you broke last night
I pick up your clothes that I threw outside
In the cold light of day we can leave it behind
Out of our minds

Chorus
I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you
But even as I walk away
And I say I'm gonna stay
Only takes a moment or two
Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you ... whoaaooh
I'm crazy for you
...
