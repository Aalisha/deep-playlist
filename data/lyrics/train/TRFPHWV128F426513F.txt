Over to under
Enter your wonder, baby
Submerge into me, baby
And take me to higher

Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me

Submerge within the light all night
Til we become the sun
Til we become the sun

See if I'm breathing
'Cause I'm not sure tonight if I'm alive
Words are demeanin' they can't describe

Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me
...
