No no! This face must go!
It will not do, we require another you!
It will not fit,
The place for which,
You are intended,
It must be mended.
That frown won't do,
But we have a cure for you.
A certain remedy,
For all those grave abnormalities.
We'll make you smile,
As you walk the mile.
The cogwheels turn,
The bridges burn,
This cure will stick.

There are no ills,
These pills won't fix.
When ill mouths speak,
These pills will educate the weak.
