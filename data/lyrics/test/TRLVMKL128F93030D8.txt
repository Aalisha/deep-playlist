I know what you're going through
I see myself the same as you
And I don't care about the things I do

I know what you keep inside
Try to fight it try to let it ride
But it seems to slip out before ya catch your tongue

Too late the damage's done
Try to fight it try to let it ride but it seemed to slip out
before I caught my tongue
Too late the damage done

Never mind what I said
I'm alive with a hole in my head
Never mind who I am
I'll survive with a hole in my head

Didn't mean it didn't even try
One word two words swallowed a fly
...
