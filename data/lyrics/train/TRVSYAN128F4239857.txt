Silence is written behind icons
Icons keep the secret of horror
Whispers reach your fear inside conscious
Horror rings deadly horizon
Nails surrounds your body
Into the area of sketched delusions

Orama of my end, which will be eternal
And the smoke of dust will swallow my eyes
Fear to think the moment of my death
Mad along with body shall bury me

What matters is the end
What kills, will soon come
A face will rot my will
A child shall meet me here
