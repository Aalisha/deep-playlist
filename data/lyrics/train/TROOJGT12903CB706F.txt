Samantha, you swore
You'd never turned that trick before
Keep waiting for a war
You'll never win, you'll lose again

Watch her wrap her legs around this world
Can't take that gutter from the girl

Samantha, you burned me out
Samantha, it's over now

Samantha, your war
Was a lost cause before I came
Keep praying
Pray for the pretty things you won't get back

Watch her wrap her legs around this world
Stab the gutter right out of that girl, that girl

Through villages of ether
My crucifixion comes
Will you sing my hallelujah?
Will you tell me when it's done?
