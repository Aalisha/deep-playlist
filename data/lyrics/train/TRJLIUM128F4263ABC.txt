And we hide behind
Lies, Anger, Hate
They shoo love away
Build shells of ourselves outside
It shelters body from cold reigns of reality

Come on
Step out
Of your rind
Assemble strength
Focus
Release
And run to me
You can never look back
To the visions from my past
They fade
And wilt in time
You've got to just trust me to hold your hand, through,
Then I turn and walk away

Eclipse you all
Bleed you, cut you away
Bleed you
And strip you
Of your states of Ain Soph Aur

Eclipse you all
Bleed you, cut you away
I spit upon my plate
And I push everything away
From me

And we sever all ties
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
I become the sacrifice
Spare your life and leave me to my misery

Get off the cross
And save yourself
Run away
You'll be okay

Run
Now get away from me
If I can get my grip
I'll pull you down into the hell
...
