She knows, she grows, she likes the hours
With a little bit of loving from her mother
My little one, she never bothers
About the things that worry you and me She sings this little song that floats along
It's quite a song
And know she's gonna be as free as yesterday
And I know in my mind it's gonna be that way Do I, do IDo I, dub da day
