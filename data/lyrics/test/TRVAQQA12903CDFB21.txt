Storms calm neon skies
Still chilling winds roam the nuclear wastes
Haunting the conscience of a forgotten existence
Civilization's mistake

Peace at last takes it's grip on the land
For a moment time stands still
Existing in the debris of bygone wars
Hope breeds an incentive not to kill

Existence declines, extinction mankind
A lifetime of time slips away

Resurrect mankind sacrificed to power
