[chorus]
One more time
Let's do it again
Show no shame,
Just call my name
One more time
Again and again
Don't you want to
Play my game?

24-7 I will make you feel like heaven
I turn you upside down
I spin you round and round
I put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine,
Let's do it one more time


You spin me round and round and Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and Hit me to the feeling
