I've got a stage and a mic
Which I use to say things you won't like
But I spent years thinking I was alone (Thinking I was alone)
Now I know, now I know, that I'm not, that I'm not
And I'm sharing that comfort with those
Who think that hope is lost

Oh and I'm so proud of where I am
I'm learning where the standard to tread lightly

So hold back
Steadfast you've gotta breathe
And be content, just count to ten
Like all the experts say and hear
The drugs don't seem to work
And they've got a padded room for you
To get your just desserts.
