Eyes black as the darkest lake
Oh wise do you have anything to say
I speak of no working horse
Ever doubt I've felt this good

I ain't gonna reach
who plunders on
Freedom is running in your blood
I ain't gonna let you cause
We're just the same kind
Freedom is running in our mind

Oh, we're waiting for...
Up and gone, clattering hooves,
Clickety clack
They make me move
Go go go with clattering hooves
Clap your hands and rattle your keys
Snap your fingers
Move your feet
Go go go with clattering hooves

Oh, what a feeling
C'mon, let's run forever
Oh we could make it
Oh, am I wrong?
Oh, what a feeling
The wind its takes us places
We took the wrong road.
Now we're going
