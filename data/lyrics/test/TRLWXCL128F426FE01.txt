You see a little girl they call
Louise McGhee
Please do me a favor and shake
her little hand for me
I said if you see a little
her name, Louise McGhee
You know, please do me a favor, shake her little hand for me

I know a little girl
like a car like a choo could
Her little low down way i wish you
had quite when you should
You know I love that little thing
Like a car, like choo you could

Little always, i sure wish you'd quit when you should

Mmm, Lookie here
If I dont go crazy
Lookie here
If I dont go crazy

Lookie here
