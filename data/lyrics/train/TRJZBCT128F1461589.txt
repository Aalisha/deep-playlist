I know how you take your morning tea
You know how I take my time
Then you try to steal my recipe
For making blue love flow like wine

I tick and you tock
I go when you stop
In ever decreasing circles
Ready or not
Baby my groove will get ya

When I talk about love
You just play games
And you tie yourself up
With lust in shackles and chains
When I talk about us
I feel no shame
And I'm never giving up
'Till we talk about
Lovey dovey, dovey stuff

I do smooth and you do rough
I used to think that you were tough
But you're scared
Say that you're not

You're so good at making fun of me
I can always make your day
