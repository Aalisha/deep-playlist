If today was my very last day

If ever there was a day
When there wasn't enough time
If I was too careless to say
You have been on my mind

I know I have passed up the chance before
But I won't to tell you now

I love, I love you, I need, I need you
No better time to say
I love, I love you, I need, I need you
This is a song for you

This is a song for you
