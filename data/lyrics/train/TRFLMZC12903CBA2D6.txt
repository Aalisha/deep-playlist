Meditation, Meditation
We only lickin’ wid a uhm
Meditation
We only coming wid a uhm
Meditation
We only fighting wid a smooth
Meditation
We only coming with a uhm
Meditation
Babylon ripe yeah
Babylon ready yeah
Babylon ripe for a pickin’
Babylon you ready for a pickin’ oh gosh

Babylon fruits ripe for a pickin’
Touch them soft
You see them bus ina you hand
Through them neva know
Nature have a time bomb it tickin’
Babylon don’t instruct I
I instruct Babylon
So long man carry water pan them head
And Ina them eye
So long man and man a function
Under your evil dominion
Jah bus the seals that is not my opinion

Meditation, Meditation
We only lickin’ wid a uhrn
Meditation
Lickin’ wid a smooth
Meditation
We only coming wid a smooth
Meditation
