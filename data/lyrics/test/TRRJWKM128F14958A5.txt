Hello lover your the girl I used to know
With a pretty face
I've seen you drawn in so many ways
can't help but tell you how much you changed
cosmetics and all
it's so hard to believe you were once my girl
oh yeah
ceramic girl you know you're so fine
ceramic girl don't try and blow my mind
ceramic girl.oh yeah
so nonchalant laid back and ready for the world
so much make-up but you were once my girl
you say you do it just for the fun
