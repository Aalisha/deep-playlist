Feeling so strange I'm seeing you clearly now
Your beauty's deadlier everyday
All these people am I the only one
Who found you out
Is no one willing to say, willing to say, willing to say

Why don't you slow down
Turn your head round
Been treading on hearts

Words - but nothing to say with it
You smile and take what you need in any way that you please
Isn't it a shame

Nothing to show from these
Lies - I told you you'd pay for it
Lonely are the days of your life

You spoke in rhymes and rhythms
The sweetest sounds
