it's magnificient
hundred dreams we spent
sold them to our hope
that is what he told

my odd company
paralizing me
it is predictable
that I need your plea

all the things I missed
and the stolen kiss
makes me wanna fly
on golden wings

Take me and fly away
to any other land
I closed my eyes to freeze
...
