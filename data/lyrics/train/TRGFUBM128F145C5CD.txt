Yeah yeah

The weather's hot like hell,
it sort of casts a spell (uhuh)
I want a friendly face
inside a cool dark space.(uhuh ow)

Yeah, summer's begun,
This is were one needs to be two.
Yeah, i know I'm gone,
but baby I'm sold on me with you

Chorus
Come as you are, you can stand,
take my hand, I'll help.
Come as you are, don't be shy, don't deny yourself. (oh)
