In your father's hands, He holds the low sun
In the sky, for a while
And three diamonds shine so bright in his eyes
They cut straight into your heart
Every second, like a shooting star
Leaves the trail, of the fairytale

Walking forwards, reaching backwards
The way things were, the way things are to be
And the love you know, is quiet and still
The memories, torn into the wind
All the colours that you are, so frozen and blurred
Start to thaw
And you are

Another chance, another day
Till he drags his shadow across the sand
And proudly mounts his horse
...
