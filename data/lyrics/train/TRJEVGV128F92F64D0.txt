You came to me like
Lightning upon a picket fence
Shattering my illusion
With shockingly bad sense
And I may never feel the same
But I won't always feel this pain

So let faith fall on me now
I'm gonna be here til the end
If you do not see me bend
Then you know
I will have been bravedancing

You rain to me like ashes
Volcanoes come and go
You seem to have such passion
For someone so shallow
And I may never feel the same
But I refuse to play these games

So let faith fall on me now
I'm gonna be here til the end
...
