I've been up
And I've been down
But everything is just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine it's true
Tougher skin?
Guess again
But not because I don't try, try, try, try, I always do
And I don't want nobody
Telling me I'm nobody

I've got a revelation
I'm a new creation, baby
The world can't bring me down

You think what?
Why the rut?
'Cause if you're towing the line, line, line, those days are through

You know it says it right here
...
