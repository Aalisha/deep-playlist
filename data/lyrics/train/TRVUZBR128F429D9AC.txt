Weaving another web of lies around me
Leaving an endless trail of pain behind me

I don't deserve the love you give to me
How to mend the damage done to you?
I would trade a kingdom for a real life mulligan
To vindicate what I have done

Home is where the heart is
So maybe that's where I left mine
I know I have failed you
But please don't change the lock on your heart

Home is where the heart is
So maybe that's where I left mine
I know I have failed you
But please don't change the lock on your heart
