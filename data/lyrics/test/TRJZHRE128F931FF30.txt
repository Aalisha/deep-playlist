Traded in my tennis shoes
For steel-toed rubber boots
I got my own uniform to wear
They've given me a plastic hat
Earplugs and a funny net for my head
I'm well-prepared

Time comes when you have to choose
Occupation you can use
Well they say it should be something you like
But hard times just don't allow
Poor boy to be choosy how he provides
How you get by

Watch out now here they come
