I'm like a beggar with no luck
I'm holding signs up
On your street corner stops
Like most you try not to see me
You stare straight ahead
Ignore the responsibility
Excuse me... excuse me Mr.
I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
I'm very anxious, eager, willing
What's your billing?

So please excuse me Mr.
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me Mr.
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

For most love comes for free
They don't pay the high cost
Of mental custody I'll pay bail for a guarantee
Please make space for me In the time yet to be
