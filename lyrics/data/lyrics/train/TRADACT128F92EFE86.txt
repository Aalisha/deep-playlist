(Ed Hill/Mark D. Sanders)

I'm fallin' head over heals for him
He's callin' me twice a night then callin' again
When I talk he likes to listen
He says I'm the one that he's been missin'
Somebody tell me that he isn't.

Just another heartache
Just another heartache
Another bad lie another goodbye
Lookin' for another heart to break.
