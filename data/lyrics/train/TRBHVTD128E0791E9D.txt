It's my arms that wrap you up nice
It's my arms
It's my arms baby
Small rooms with record exec types
Whisper away my future lately

I'll introduce you
To producers
I'll write your songs and make them way damn shorter

I'm so confused
This industry has made me cold you'll find
I trusted you to make me shine bright
This is almost getting old
