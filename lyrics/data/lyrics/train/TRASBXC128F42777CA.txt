I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You'll change

You'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises
You'll change
You'll never change

You're never never gonna keep your promises
You said you'd changed
But I'm afraid

It's something I won't live to see
It seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Same old lie, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways

Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben- You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben- You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben- If you don't wanna find me gone, gone
...
