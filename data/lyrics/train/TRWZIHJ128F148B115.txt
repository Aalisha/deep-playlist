Another day goes without any change,
The feeling we live with still remains,
We're stuck in a hole, and we're searching for anything
To hold on to.
There has to be somewhere that we can be safe
From the lives we live each day.
There has to be somewhere that we can be far away...

We have to escape, and I will go anywhere
If you just lead the way.
Escape to a place where we'll be together,
Together every day.
We have to escape...

We could be living how we wanted to, (we wanted to)
...
