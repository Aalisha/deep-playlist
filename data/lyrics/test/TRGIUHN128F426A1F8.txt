I saw you sitting on the pavement
Watching the goose-step of the crowd
You were a picture of rebelliion
A kleptomaniac and proud

Well I should've seen it coming
From miles away
Kiss the pavement goodbye
And say hello to the ice age

Queen Jane
You've got everything to fight for
Queen Jane
You've got everything to lose
Queen Jane
You've got everything to live for

And there's a lot more people worse off than you

I caught him looking for employers
With his macho pressgang crowd
...
