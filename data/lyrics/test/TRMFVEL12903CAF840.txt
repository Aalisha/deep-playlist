A breath of fresh air, that's what you are to me,
when I need that room to breathe your part of me;
Your always right there, I look into your eyes
and I see how hard it is to fight what's meant to be;
I'm giving in, can't fight a love so strong,
girl don't stop keep it coming on and on;
Your like sweet music to that same old song
and the hook of love is all I hear;

Over and Over,
I love you girl,
and I've yet to find someone to come close to you,
Over and over,
...
