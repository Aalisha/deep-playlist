Some you'll get over, some you never let go.
Some you'll forget and some, you'll always know.
Some memories linger, some memory's hard to recall.
Over and over you'll find you laugh through it all.(All.)

All the temptations,
All. (All.)
All the relations.
All. (All.)
All the sad faces.
None with the vaguest idea.

Some you'll remember for something said or done.
