You believe in Heaven
You believe the Devil is here
When you ring your demon bell
You think I'll en up in Hell

[Chorus:]
Oh yeah you're the Preacher
You're the Devil
You're the Preacher
Hiding in the Underworld, that's you

I can't wait to see your final show
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna miss you so
