If I lose my life, I will find again
I will soar on eagle's wings and then
Ever cease from war, rest in Jesus arms
For the Lord, He's good and I am safe from harm

It's the Lord that gives, heard the prophets say
And I will bless His name, though he takes away
I will trust, not fear, naught to be alarmed
For the Lord, He's good and I am safe from harm
