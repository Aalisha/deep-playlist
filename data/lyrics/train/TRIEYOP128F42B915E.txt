Aman aman aman aman
Aman aman aman aman
Aman aman aman aman
Aman aman aman aman
Whyclef JEAN - Rap

Like a flame it's burning up
I can see it taking off
Never felt this way before
I'm so lost in you uuh
We don't even need to speak
I just need to feel your heart
Skin to skin do it sin to sin come on
Baby make me uuh uuh

I wanna get to know you in the physical
I wanna go below
Get you get you all alone
And then we let it go

WHY DON'T WE DO IT?
