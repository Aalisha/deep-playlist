Starting something
Thought could be fun
Started something
Couldn't go on

Danger, heartache
I always knew
There's no winner
In this game you lose

But I still wanna know
How she got in the door uninvited?

Ohh, I got a rocket
Ohh, you're going on it
Ohh, you're never coming back

Cliches, secrets
Stories unfold
...
