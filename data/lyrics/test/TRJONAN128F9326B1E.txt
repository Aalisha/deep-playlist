You probably wish you were
Anywhere but here...
Remember this now 'cos it soon will disappear
You'll find yourself wishing
You're anyone but you.
I'm starting to wish I were
Anyone but me.
And I will be broken by this...
As soon as you wake you will
Find me on my way.
And soon when it's safe you may
...
