This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive
I miss the grinded concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights

I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
