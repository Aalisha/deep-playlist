I got a sixty-five Cadillac
Sparetyre on the back
I got a charge account at Goldblatt's
But I don't have you

I got women to the left of me
I got women to the right of me
I got chicks all around me
But I don't have you

I got a tavern, a liquor store
I got the numbers four forty-four
I got a Mojo and don't you know
I'm all dressed up with no place to go
...
