Captured effortlesly. That's the way it was.
Happened so naturely. I did not know it was love.
The next thing I felt was you. Holding me close
What was I gonna do. I let myself go.

And now we're flying through the stars.
Want this night will last for ever.

I've been waiting for you. It's been so long.
I knew just what I would do when I heard your song.
I fill my heart with your bliss. Gave me freedom.
You knew I could not resist. I needed someone.

And now we're flying through the stars.
