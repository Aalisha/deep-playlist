Oh, we never not gonna go home
We won't go, we won't go
Oh, we never not gonna go phone
'Cause mother isn't home

Oh, sugarbush, I love you so
I will never let you go
So, don't you let your mother know
Sugarbush, I love you so

Sugarbush, what can I do
Mother's not so pleased with you
Promise me you will be true
