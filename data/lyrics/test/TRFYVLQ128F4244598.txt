I object to what I want to see
Not feeling close outside of me
Some distant memory
or something forgotten

I object to what I feel inside
Everyone walks around like a sign
Some kind of cheap paperback novel
You read it once and then it's discarded

Tied up like a knot with what I grew up in
Everytime I change
...
