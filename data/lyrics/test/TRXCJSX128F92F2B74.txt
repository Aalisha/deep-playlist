When this old world gets me down
And there's no love to be found
I close my eyes and soon I find
I'm in a playground in my mind
Where the children laugh
And the children play
And we sing a song all day

My name is Michael
I've got a nickel
I've got a nickel shiny and new
I'm gonna buy me all kinds of candy
That's what I'm gonna do
