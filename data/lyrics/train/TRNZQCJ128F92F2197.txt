well, it's on my mind-
I'm headin back in time,
and when i think of all the songs we used to play,
and then i think of you and it's all right,
i think of you and it's all right.

well, it's this sort of thing that gets me to lose my mind,
and it's the flash-flashy eyes that make it worth while,
and every time when we'd, we'd get together,
we'd just fall in love again

all in all, it's the perfect scene
and it's not anywhere that i would rather be
and it's now, now or never when we're chasing our dreams
and oh, we're getting close now-
don't turn away
