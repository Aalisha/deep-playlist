Because a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
I guess we were never going to be friends
I've never really liked people that are too right on
Mind you, I'd love to turn my back on everything I've preached for years
I bet that's a right laugh

Because a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
And no you can't come back to mine
Because I know that you will find
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
