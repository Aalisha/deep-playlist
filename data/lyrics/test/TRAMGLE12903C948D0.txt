(E.M. Bartlett)

When I was a little boy around the table at home
I remember very well when company would come
I would have to be right still until the whole crowd ate
My mama always said to me Jim take a tater and wait.

But I had to eat 'em just the same
That is why I look so bad and have these puny ways
Because I always had to take an old cold tater and wait.
