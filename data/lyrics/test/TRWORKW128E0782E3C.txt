I couldn't stand up looking up at the faded party
I couldn't stand up looking up at a faded party

It was a mistake pageant
It was a mistake from the start

Couldn't stand up looking up, I'm at a faded party
I couldn't stand up looking at, at a famous party

It was a mistake pageant
It was a mistake from the start
