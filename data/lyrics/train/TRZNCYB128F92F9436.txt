[Reason] Think hard, you are lying here in a hospital bed
Disregard the emotions inside your head
Concentrate on the real world beyond your mind
It's not to late to leave your burdens behind

[Fear] We won't let you go
Take you down below
Dark crypts of your soul
Locked inside your head...
You're better of dead

[Agony] Locked away, she lives in isolation
It's been that way, since he has gone
She been through life of depravation
She depends on you, her only son

[Passion] She won't let you go
Keep you down below
Dark crypts of your soul
Locked inside your head
You're better of dead

[Agony] Where are you, can't you hear her calling?
Nothing you can do, you have no time
There is no one there, to catch her now she's falling
