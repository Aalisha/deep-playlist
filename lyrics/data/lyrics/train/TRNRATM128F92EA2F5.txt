Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be

Take a look through time
As past or present words to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living walls

Broken glass reflections
...
