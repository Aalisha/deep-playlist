So, it comes to the end of the day
And I'm checking out of my hotel room today
It's been two years since I've seen your face
The girl beside me reminds me how you taste
Since I've seen you, I've been beaten down and bruised
And every day I'm feeling more and more misused
I never thought that I would be without your love
Years gone by, you're still the one I'm thinking of

Chorus:
Sweet Savannah, you shine so bright
May the evening bring your favorite night
...
