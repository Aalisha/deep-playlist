Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah oh

Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be
What you need?
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more
Losin' sight of me
I'm lettin' you know this can't go on
This one way street
I'm walkin' alone
This time I'm breakin' free
I'm goin' to find me

I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
(Wanted me to be)
If it can't be fifty fifty
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause baby that's not me

Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you but I can't baby, you
If it's your mama, you want
You know just what to do
I looked in the mirror everyday
I saw myself fadin' away
Your tryin' to mold be into her
I loved you so
I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be?
