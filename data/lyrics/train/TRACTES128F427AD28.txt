Give us your tired and weak and we will make them strong 
Bring us your foreign songs and we will sing along 
Leave us your broken dreams we'll give them to mend 
There's still a lot of love living in the promiseland 

Living in the promiseland 
Our dreams are made of steel 
The prayer of every man is to know how freedom feels 
There is a winding road across the shifting sand 
And room for everyone living in the promiseland 
...
