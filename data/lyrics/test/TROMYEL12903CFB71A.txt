The freedom around my father's grave
now drifted by the winds of war... and disturbed
and all of my sorrows all my pleas
now buried under machines' roar - it is not a dream

May the laughter of children help us in the end

turn the base in our hometown into a bugbane plant

that hold off the aircraft coming like a swarm of bees
and the flight of big grey moths to the flame in the Middle East

Now I was 13 months at sea
And it feels like I'm coming home
This port is a well-known place to me
So I kneel down to touch the stone

And for a minute I thought I could understand
That all is one in all
... here in my Neverland
Then the wind takes it all

Under the sirens of the night
I hear an ancient melody
"Flyâ€œ is a boy who sings for the world
And writing an anthem for too many gods
...
