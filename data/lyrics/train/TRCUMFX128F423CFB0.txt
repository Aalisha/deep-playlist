Man down
This hardened shell is broken
My fate is bound to what I've done
Regrets - I shuffle down the hallway
Precious time - It's all gone overboard
Here is your calm down pill
I'll never be the same - It'll never be the same
With eyes wide open - My body's floating down the river
This live - What have I confined you for? It's all inside - It's all in silence
When the raven gets its way
A Million thoughts are swept away
And then you leave it all
...
