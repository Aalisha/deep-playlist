[CLEF]
Another MC lose his life tonight, lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
O lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

[CLEF]

I haunt MC's like Mephistophales
Bringin swords and Damacles
Secret service keep a close watch as
if my name was Kennedy Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax.
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation.
I Feel like Rockwell, "Somebody's watching me"
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea.
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrit, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit.
It hurts don't it,
the refugees come to your turf and take over the earth.

[LAURYN]: INTERLUDE
See my rhymes are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how the refugees do.

[LAURYN]

Behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
Two MC's can't occupy the same space at the same time.
