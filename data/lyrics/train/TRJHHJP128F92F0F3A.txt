Days and nights and days
Been caught in a rhythm
Can't keep running
Never look
Never looks back
To the promises broken
But can't help wondering
On a day like today
When there's nothing new
What's she gonna do
Another day like today
With the same old view
Chorus:

Stepped out to life
In full bloom
Got lost under the sun
Blinded
She still moves on
Coming undone
When she dreams in color
It's only black and blue
She's like a fading flower
And life's in full bloom
...
