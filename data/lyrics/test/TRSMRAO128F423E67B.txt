[Roger]:
The harder we play
The faster we fall
When we think that we know it all
We know nothing at all

The letter arrives
Like a bolt from the blue
So what's left of your lives
All your dreams lost to you

Say it ain't true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away

Say it's not true
Say it's not real
Can't be happening to you
