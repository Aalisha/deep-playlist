I know that it's ten
And you're stayin' in
La la la la la la la la la
And you're stayin' home
And I'm all alone
La la la la la la la la la

Wont you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water
Bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin'
And I feel fine
I know that you want to
And I know that you do
...
