Oooh (I wanna jazz it up)
In the morning (I wanna jazz it up)
In the evening (I wanna jazz it up)
Oh, I can feel it (I wanna jazz it up)

Oooh (I wanna jazz it up)
In the morning (I wanna jazz it up)
In the evening (I wanna jazz it up)
Oh, I can feel it (I wanna jazz it up)

Jazz it up, jazz it up
Ja-ja, jazz it up (Back to the start line)
Jazz it up, jazz it up
Ja-ja, jazz it up (No wailin' man)

Jazz it up, jazz it up
Ja-ja, jazz it up (Wicked, man!)
Jazz it up, jazz it up
Ja-ja, jazz it up (I'm with it!)

Listen to the drummer, me said listen to the beat
Jazz music makes you move your feet
Listen to the number, me said listen to the rhythm
And when you move off your body, you are movin' it all night
