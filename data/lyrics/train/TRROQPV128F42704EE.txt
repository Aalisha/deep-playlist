Sitting burden on the office chair
Empty mind, empty bank account
If this is your piece
Your piece is a mess to me

Hundreds killed on the Internet
Life delete, all is set
If this is your truth
Your truth is a mess to me

If common sense means no control
You've got it all.
If common sense means no control
You've got it all, you've got it
...
