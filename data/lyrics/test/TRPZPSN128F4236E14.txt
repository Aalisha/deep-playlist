I can not bear this faking anymore
Can't make any decisions
Based on your facts
Won't go down anymore
To the sound of your devils laugh

I can see that all you are
Is just an age long fact
Just have to wonder how
You keep it all intact

All is planned to the very last breath
This whole picture is blurred
All said to the very last word
'god is dead' haven't you heard?
