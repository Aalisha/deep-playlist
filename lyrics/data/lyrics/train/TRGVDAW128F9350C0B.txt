Ooo, I may not drive a new mercedes
But i'll chauffeur my girl, to the edge of the world
I may not wear a golden watch now
But ill be right on time, for a woman so fine

When I love so pure, 
The object of my affection, thats her
She lives on the other side of town
And i know that her father doesn't want me hangin' around
But I'm gonna turn her whole world upside-down
If i make her mine, o mine, o mine
...
