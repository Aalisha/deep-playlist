Goin' through the motions
Tryin' not to snore
Didn't know the gun was loaded
Goin' through my motion

Caught without an oar
Someone said they all were phony

Time out, save the play
Try to make the lie last
Any old way we can
Signed out all the way
When you speak your mind out
Never say what you plan
