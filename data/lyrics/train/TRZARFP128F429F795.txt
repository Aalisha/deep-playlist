Shake!
[Everybody say it!] Shake!
[Early in the morning] Shake!
[Late in the evening] Shake!
[In the midnight hour] Shake!
[When the time's going bad, now] Shake!
Shake with the FEELING!
Shake with the FEELING!

Listen while I'm talkin' to you now
Tell you what I'm gonna do now
There's a new thing going around now
I'll tell what to put down now

You move your body all around
And just shake
Thats the way you do it Shake, Shake, Shake it baby
Shake it like a bowl of soup
