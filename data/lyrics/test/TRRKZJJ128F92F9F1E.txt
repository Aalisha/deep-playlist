I heard it came to town,
A new kind of rhythm,
Spread around,
Sort of set you sizzlin',
Now I'm all through with symphony,
Oh, rock it for me!

Every night
You'll see all the nifties
Plenty tight,
Swingin' down the fifties,
Now they're all through with symphony,
Ho ho ho, rock it for me!

Now it's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing,
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme,
So won't you satisfy my soul
...
