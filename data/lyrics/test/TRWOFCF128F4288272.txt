When I get home, babe
Gonna light the fire
All day I've been thinking about you
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh babe, I wanna feel your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah

Don't know what I do without you
Don't know what I need
And not just another lover
You're everything to me
Every time I'm with you, boy
Can't believe it's true
When you lay in my arms
and we do the things we do

You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
Love you.
Need you.
