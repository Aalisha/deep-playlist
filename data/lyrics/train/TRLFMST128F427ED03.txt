I never wanted to be, like every other child abandoned in childhood drama (oh)
I always felt that I was the exception to the rule but now who's the fool
you won't give me your love your love
so when you left me I filled up that empty place and never told it's still hollow (it's still hollow)
can't you see potential you have and what you dreamed if it's not based in reality
and your denial is a tragedy
and your excuses backed up by love can hinder more than a brave risk you take even if it cracks on this floor
you won't give me your love
you weren't living your love
you won't give me your love
your love
