This is a story about a girl that I knew
She didn't like my songs and that made me feel blue
She said a big band is far better than you...

She don't rock'n'roll, she don't like it
She don't do the stroll, well she don't do it right
Well everything's wrong and my patience is gone
When I woke one morning and remembered this song
Kinda catchy
