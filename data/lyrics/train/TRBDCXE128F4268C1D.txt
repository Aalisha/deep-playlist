Jump, jump
You should know, you should know thatahhh
Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally krossed out
We commence to make you

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya Jump Jump
The Daddy Mac will make ya Jump Jump
Kris Kross will make ya Jump Jump

Don't try to compare us to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad givin' ya something that you never had
I'll make ya rump rump wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna Jump
How high? Real high
Cause I'm just so fly
A young loveable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside-out its wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pump to keep you jumpin'
R&B - rap and bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
And ain't something about Kris Kross we all that
So when they ask do they rock say believe that

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump
Kris Kross will make ya jump, jump
uh huh uh huh
Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya jump, jump
A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump
Kris Kross will make ya jump, jump
