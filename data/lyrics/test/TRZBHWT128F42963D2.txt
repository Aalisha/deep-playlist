Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
You use to call me your angel

Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holding me
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear, every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know

I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you
You use to call me your dreamer
