King of Kings
King of Jews, Messiah
Seductive pain, delicious pain
The drag of the wounds
of the nails in his hands
Writhe and dance apon the cross...
Embracing knowledge of Angels
Begotten not made
This senseless vanity
of the Nazarene - puppet of God, Jesus
The agony is beginning
To lose its sweetness
...
