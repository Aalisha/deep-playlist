Am i wasting all my time
Chasing innocence to find
A time of my life when i should have known better
Have i wasted all these years
Hiding back the tears behind a smiling face
AM I LYING

Cause i wanna do whats right
But i need to understand
do i burn a bridge and call it a life lesson
As these thoughts come floating in
Where the memorys raised to high a price to pay

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the millionth time today
Im still waiting
