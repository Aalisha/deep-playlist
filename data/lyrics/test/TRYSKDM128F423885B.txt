Here's my ghetto story
Been in hell, through the fire
Now gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story
So many reasons to sing this
Now we got the keys to the kingdom

I remember those days when hell was my home
When me and mama bed was a big piece of foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When mama gone a work me go street go roam

I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone
And make him licke bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome

I remember when we run fatta get him knee blown
And mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the Avenue tun inna war zone
An Mickey madda fly him out 'cuz she get a loan

But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and seen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and that is well known
Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone, me say Mikey

We get da kingdom, dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
We have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top, baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

I remember those days when we was dead broke
