You take your entrances anything but lightly
With a smile kept under lock and key
Write these words across your face, backwards for the mirror
Never let your guard down, broken heels won't hold you up forever

Lights out
You're the ghost of a better person
Taking cover in a darkened corner
Haunting anyone who looks your way

Lights out
You're a line from a movie, baby
The one that comes up
When there's nothing more to say

The whole night's novelty
...
