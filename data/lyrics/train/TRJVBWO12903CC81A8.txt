She said, "I never really thought I'd need this"
I said, "My goal is to be cigarettes to you"
It might sound dangerous
But that just means it's worth it

I said, "I wanna get the shakes out, lady"
She said, "You don't know what you're getting into, boy"
This is a story
Where the epilogue is endless

So c'mon, c'mon
Freak out (This audio survival)
Tune in and turn it out (This rock 'n' roll revival)
...
