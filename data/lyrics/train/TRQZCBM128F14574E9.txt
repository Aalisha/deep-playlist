Who is it, who walked the streets of Galilee?
Healing the sick and setting the captives free
Do you know who it is?

Who is it, who for sinners shed his blood?
Now for cleansing all can plunge, beneath that flood

Yes it's Jesus, but do you know who he is

He's the image, of the invisible god
He's the brightness of his glory
The first and the last
The future, the past
