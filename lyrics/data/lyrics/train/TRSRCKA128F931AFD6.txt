A frightening scream pierces the night
A deliverance of an oppressive plight
Terror engulfs satanic life
A suffering of eternal strife

Attack is before you, pray a light might guide you
From mortal fear in your life
A stand to fight, no more wrong or right
The accuser will be judged by sanctity

Stricken by the curse of heavenly sin
Legions behold the final day
Allegiance to the end, a blood feast at the hands
That wash themselves of their foretold decay
...
