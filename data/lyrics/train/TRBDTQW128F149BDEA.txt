so here i go i know this feeling awfully well
i could build a camera custom made to tape record the smell
of the perfume that we used to share until you spilled it on the floor what more
could anyone ask for

i remember you in polaroid
the glitter and the glue
and all that noise
i should probably sort of miss you
but i see you all the time in polaroid

up up
and away in my beautiful cliche
...
