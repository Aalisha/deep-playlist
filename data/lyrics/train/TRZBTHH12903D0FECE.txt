Now this one is designed for 18 and over
over, said 18 and over, over
hey girl, wont you go home,
go home to your mamma, your mamma
go home to your pappa, your pappa
you're too young to be my lover,
to be say me lover, ooh
you must be 18 and over,

I've been checking you out
but you are too young girl
and a girl like you will
cause worries into my world
'cuz if I pick you up girl
it's pain and misery for me
'cuz you're a girl that is so rude
as rude as can be, like boy

go home to your mamma, your mamma
go home to your pappa, your pappa
you're too young to be my lover, my lover
not for me a lover
ohhh eeeiiee
