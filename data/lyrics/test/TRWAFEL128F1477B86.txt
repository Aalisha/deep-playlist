Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

Throughout this
Great big world of ours
There are so many folks
Who just can't get involved

Now they receive you readily
And will deceive you dreadfully
Oh, yeah, it's a reality

I'll just do my best, yeah
To to try and make all those
Phony relationships dissolve

Now I suppose
They could help themselves
So I grow close to surround myself
With love and humanity
