They'll do you harm and use your body and mind
They will make you a slave for lickerish games
And you will get thirsty for love
Thirsty for pain and for tears
In the house of unkinds
They'll take your pride and your virginity
In the house of unkinds
They'll draw your slip down to your knees
Your naked frailty is too precious
A treasure for them all
Your naked frailty will be
Dragged down for abuse
