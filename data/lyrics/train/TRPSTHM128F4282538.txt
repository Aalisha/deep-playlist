What's mine is yours, though you were never mine
My gracious doors are, are open wide
I gave my hand, I gave my whole life too
But you took my plan, and turned it into bad, bad news

From this revelation that I just can't bear

You gotta have some wisdom that you'd like to share

Tell me, how can you judge me
Before we meet?
Tell me, how can you hear me
Before I, before I, before I speak?

My heavy head, my heavy mind
My skinny self is working overtime

And those who heard are left without a doubt
