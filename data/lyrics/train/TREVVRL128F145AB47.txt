Come on up, hey little darling

That was the way when I first met you baby
You weren't right for me
I didn't really care
Act quite naturally

She said
Went on a boat going down by the river
Plenty more supplies
Seen a lot of planes going up in the air

Do you ever get the feeling
That you want to fly like a bird in the sky

Hey lucille, you'll be the talk of the town
Lucille hey, you'll be the talk of the town
She met a young man called johnnie
He played a little mean guitar

No matter how hard I try
I want to fly like a bird in the sky
