These days you barely even say my name
Like you don't really feel the same
I'm wondering what's to blame

These nights I fall asleep wondering where you are
It feels like we're falling apart
And it's only breaking my heart

'Cause if being with you means being alone
And never knowing when you're coming home
Then I guess I'm better off on my own

But I can't move on 'cause that means forgetting
Forgetting everything we had
Instead I keep running, keep running
I keep running back

'Cause I keep forgetting
Forgetting you treat me so bad
So I keep on coming, keep coming
I keep coming back

I keep coming back, I keep coming back
And I keep running back, I keep running back
I keep coming back, I keep coming back
And I keep running back, I keep running back

My friends say that I should leave you behind
And stop wasting all of my time
They tell me that I'm outta my mind
