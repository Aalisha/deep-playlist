The sun just got through going down
On a sleepy little Texas town
Population plus one minus one

A new grandma rocks my sister's kid
Just like twenty years ago she did
The same thing in that same chair
She said, "This one's born to run"

Every day at noon like a chapel bell
Find her Jesus keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong
At the end of the day

I got 5 good years and a tank of gas
Fifty watts and Johnny Cash
A guitar and a broken heart
Just full of things to say

You taught me how to stand those tests and trials
...
