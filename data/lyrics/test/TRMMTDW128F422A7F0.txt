I can't belive it came to this, I live my life with no regrets 
I rise. Every single time you lie 
Stripped down, from all my dignity, you took it all from me 
To me... I'll play that game of hate 

I slither down your spine. Slither! 
As I slither. I slither down your spine. Slither! 
I slither down your spine. Slither! 
I'll take it all away 
...
