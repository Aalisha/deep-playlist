Break out the songs and we'll sing along
I've fallen for you
Where did you come from
Where did you come from?

Our tiny towns and our basement sounds
Pre-packaged for you
Some never get here
Their loss is so clear

And I always saw this happen
I just never saw the route we'd take
I always saw this happen
I learned from your eyes and our mistakes

We live in a fiction
Too good to be true
We're sundowners, all hours
...
