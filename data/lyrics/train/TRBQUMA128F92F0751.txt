Ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class

Ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweaters
Ain't got no perfume, ain't got no love
Ain't got no faith
Ain't got no culture
Ain't got no mother, ain't got no father

Ain't got no brother, ain't got no children
Ain't got no aunts, ain't got no uncles
Ain't got no love, ain't got no mind
Ain't got no country, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no nothing

Ain't got no water, ain't got no air
Ain't got no smokes, ain't got no chicken
Ain't got no...
Ain't got no water
Ain't got no love

Ain't got no air
Ain't got no God
Ain't got no wine
Ain't got no money
...
