Clair
The moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me
Which I couldn't see
And then
The moment I met you again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so
It couldn't be no
But try
As hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say, to me you're more than a child
