You won't need a dime to board in the master's house.
You won't need a dime to board in the master's house,
'Cause he'll sell you a thousand for a hundred and tell you the rest is on loan,
'Til you try to build a house of? your own;
You owe every crossbeam and stone.
You won't need a dime.
You won't need a tool to work in the master's field
You won't need a tool to work in the master's field
