Can you imagine that it's all up to you?
Evil embrace of powers unnatural
You're left in silence nothing more to behold
You close your eyes and visualize the day you'll get away

It's here, it's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher
It's here, it's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Crying alone at night your destiny unknown
Your every being full of rage and hate
Seems like you're running but you just can not hide
It's in a raging fear all solitude is left behind
