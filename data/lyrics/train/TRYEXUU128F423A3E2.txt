She's fresh to death
She'll be the death of you
Seduction leads to destruction
She's fresh to death
She'll be the death of me
She's fresh but not so clean

Cute face, slim waist
She's got 'em in a craze
Yeah I think he's going crazy
When she speaks it makes me grind my teeth
Yet he still thinks she's amazing
And she's been playing games
Ever since '98
Shallow is as shallow does, yeah
Some people never change

She's so fine
She's thinks she's so damn fine
She might be fine
But she ain't worth a second of your time

You're as fake as the moans you make
