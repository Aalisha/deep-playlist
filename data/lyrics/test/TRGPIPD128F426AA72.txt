In Santa Monica, in the wintertime,
the lazy streets so undemanding
I walk into the crowd
In Santa Monica, you get your coffee from
the coolest places on the promenade
Where people dress just so
Beauty so unavoidable,
everywhere you turn it's there.
I sit and wonder what am I doing here

But on the telephone line I am anyone,
I am anything I want to be.
I could be a super model or Norman Mailer
And you wouldn't know the difference
