I had a dollar in my pocket
And dirt on my hands
She was a rich man's daughter
Who didn't give a damn
She had all the boys talkin'
With her fancy cat walkin'
But it was me who took her home
And gave her bed a good rockin'

Cause at the end of the day
Honey when it's all said and done...
I can't get enough of that diamond in the rough
...
