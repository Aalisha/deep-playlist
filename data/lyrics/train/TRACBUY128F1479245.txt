14 people in the club
Ima robot; what, no love?
Backstage she came rolling up
She said, "Do anything and I love ya."

Well, there must be a mistake
Girl, you're way too hot
You could make a million dollars with the face you got
Don't you know my last number was a flop?
She said, "Do anything and I love ya."

Well, I don't do love letters
I'm no good with flowers
If I forget your birthday
Will you still love me?

Well, what are the odds of
One true love?
You say "high"
But I have my doubts

What are the odds of
Me letting you down?
Please don't cry; it's just your love
It creeps me out
