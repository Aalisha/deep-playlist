Your eyes don't lie
They give you away
You say, you say
Everything is different today
Your footsteps fall, all over the place
You're up, you're down
A butterfly caught in the cage

I don't know why I needed you more
I don't know how, you got through the door
I don't know where you were
But back and forth, back and forth

This is the last goodbye I'm ever gonna say
This is the last goodnight I'm ever gonna waste
This kiss is poisonous
If you can't control the way, it enters your soul

One love, one life, one love is better than you tonight

Sunday driver, you never get far
You call, you call, everyone is juggling hearts
...
