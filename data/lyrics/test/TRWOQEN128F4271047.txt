Feel is a word I can't explain
At least not in words that are plain
Make it easy to express
But I'll try to do my best
To hit you where it counts
I just want to build up
A solid bond in your heart
(yeah) a solid bond in your heart (aha)

I'm fuelled by the idea
That this world was made to share
But it never seems to work out
And all we seem to share
...
