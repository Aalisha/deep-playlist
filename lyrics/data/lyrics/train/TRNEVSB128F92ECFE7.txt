Oh the night draws on and on
Now that you're gone
Now that you're far away
My thoughts seem to stray

I sit alone and stare
Even though you're not there
Even though you're not mine
Forever I'll pine

You may call me foolish
Oh I try and you know it'll be true
But I don't wanna be loved
By anybody but you
...
