Times like these, I sit and wonder
Lord it really can't be right
That a love like theirs, so pure and so divine
Suffers one more lonely night

For her faith could move a mountain,
And make a blind man see.
She won't linger in the valley of despair,
As she fights to set him free.

So may his spirit never die,
Or his heart be broke in two,
...
