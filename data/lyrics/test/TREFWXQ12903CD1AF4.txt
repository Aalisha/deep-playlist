“It's late enough,
all your kids should be home.”
The policeman says
as he takes your beer for his own.

to the town line and back and over again
So he winks at your girls
and tells you all “I'll see you later”

I was stealing kisses from a boy

in my house dress,
don't you know who I am,
don't you know who I am.
Standing in your kitchen.
