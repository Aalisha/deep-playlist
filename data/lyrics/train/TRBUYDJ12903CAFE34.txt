Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And thought I act like I cannot hear
Their situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say good-bye
And his answer tears my heart apart:

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

Walking with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say good-bye
...
