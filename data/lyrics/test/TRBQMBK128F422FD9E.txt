You really like gorillas?
We've got just the pet for you
It's the way you're forced to act
To survive our schools

Make your whole life revolve around sports
Walk tough - don't act too smart
Be a mean machine
Then we'll let you get ahead


(chorus)
Jock-O-Rama - Save my soul
We're under the thumb of the Beef Patrol
The future of America is in their hands
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls


Pep rally in the holy temple
And you're forced to go
Masturbate en masse
With the favored religious cult


Cheerleaders yell - "Ra Ra Team"
From the locker room parades the prime beef
When archaeologists dig this up
They'll either laugh or cry
