I've Got Blood In My Eyes For You Trk 18 3: 18

Sam Chatmon - bass guitar, (brother) Lonnie Chatmon - fiddle

I was out this mo'nin, feelin' blue
I said-a, 'Good-lookin' girl can I make love with you?'
Hey-hey-hey, babe
I've got blood in my eyes for you
Hey-hey-hey, babe
I've got blood in my eyes for you-ooo
I've got blood in my eyes for you, baby
I don't care what in this world you do

I went back home, put on my tie
Gon' get that girl that 'is money will buy
A-hey-hey, babe
I've got blood in my eyes for you
Hey-hey-hey, babe
I've got blood in my eyes for you-ooo
I've got blood in my eyes for you, baby
I don't care what in the world you do
