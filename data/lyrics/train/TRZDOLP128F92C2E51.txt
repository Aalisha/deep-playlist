Well I'm lookin' out the window... I'm lookin' at you
Yeah I'm lookin' out the window... I'm lookin' at you
Well I'm dreamin' all the sweet dreams and the memories of the past
Feel so fine honey... Thats why our love should last
Feel so good baby and it's all because of you
I've gotta love ya... I need to love ya... I want to love ya so nice
We're havin' all the time to ourselves
