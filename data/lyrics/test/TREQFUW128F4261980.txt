Folks, here's a story about Minnie the Moocher
She was a red hot hoochie-koocher
She was the roughest, toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Hidee hidee hidee hi
Oh oh oh oh
Hee dee hee dee hee dee hee
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

She messed around with a bloke named Smoky
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
