Crucify me for a lie
While You cut another line to breathe
Holy roller, poster child for fear and insecurity

Well, nothing is holy and nothing is sacred
They'll cut to the bone to get under your skin
I've stolen, I've lied, I've done my time,
But I won't pay for your sin

You don't have to bow your head in shame
Cus I can see right through you and I know that you have felt that way
Never will I bow my head in shame
I live this life with no regret, a lesson for you in respect
