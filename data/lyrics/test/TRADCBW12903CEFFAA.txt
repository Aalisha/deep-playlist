I sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs & one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more

Odin owns ye all

I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me
