Blindfolded... you're leaving me behind
To keep me from the daylight
Where I would find your intentions
Surrounded by unbreakable walls
Left behind chained in an empty room
Crawling in dark, imprisoned in silence
Climbed the ladder too soon
Blindfolded... you're leaving me behind
To keep me from the daylight
Where I would find your intentions
Pertaining to the night
Blindfolded... you're leaving me behind
To keep me from the daylight
Where I would find your intentions
Blindfolded... you're leaving me behind
To keep me from the daylight
Where I would find your intentions
Pertaining to the night
...
