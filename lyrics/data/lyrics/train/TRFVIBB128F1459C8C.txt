Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone, oh

Sleeping single in a double bed
Tossing, turning trying to forget
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed

I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry
'Cause drinking doubles alone don't make it a party
Another sleepless night and it's the same old story
