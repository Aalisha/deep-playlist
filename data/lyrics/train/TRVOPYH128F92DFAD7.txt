Hold on, everything will be alright
Hold on, love is on the other side

When she's down and blue
And you don't understand her, no
You got to see it through
And try to be tender

Hold her hand, yeah
And just show her that you're her man

Hold on, everything will be alright
Hold on, love is on the other side
Oh, yeah

Whenever she needs somebody
To blow off steam to, yeah
You just make her your world
and try to live what she's been trough
...
