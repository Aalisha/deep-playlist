Marched from a burning ship into a rained out parade. with a bottle and a bible the dregs are armed to the teeth.
We traded distinction and praise for the tedious claim that we were wed in the trenches while college boys pine for loveless exchange.

The locals will bury my wandering eyes at the docks of the potters field where the rifles of ranking men are equipped with 21 silencers.
