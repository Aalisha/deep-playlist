(feat. Brett Beavers, Jim Beavers)

I only slept for a couple of hours
In the back of my buddy's truck
I must be runnin' on solar power
'Cause I'm ready to crank back up

And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine

There's a hole in my beach towel
