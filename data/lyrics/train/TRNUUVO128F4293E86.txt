There you are standing strong, I'm a leaf holding on
You believe like a child, in this fire runnin' wild
Oh I love how you see right to the heart of me

You're a waterfall washing over me
I'm a thirsty man, let me drink you in
Well I am on my way, you're a mountain top
When I reach for you, your love lifts me up
All that I want is to be where you are
