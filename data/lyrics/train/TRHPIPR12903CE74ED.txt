Pray for rain to wash over the fires you made
Harvesting of the sustenance coursing thru my veins
New american christ for the weak
Selling utopia, doom is the price we pay

You're looking away, ignoring the flames but you know...

It's an altar of lies
It's an abomination of truth
The end of all hope
Before you're reborn you must die
...
