I'm not going - No, no not me
How can you run from a tragedy
I'm not going - No, no not me
So what if you got a Ph.D.

Take a look around - You'll end up in the ground
Cut in the prime of youth, slain 'cause you tell the truth
It's a mess to confess, to be young and free
Unless you hold on to your dignity

The days are short - the night are long
In the field with the beast - I do not belong
I'm sticking to my attitude
