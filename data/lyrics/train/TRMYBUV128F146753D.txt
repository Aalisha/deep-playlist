A-d-do-do-d-do

Whoever said that big boys don't cry, yeah
You say you never shed a tear
Well, listen, that's a lie

We're all defenseless When it comes to pain
I said boys and girls alike, yeah
We're all the same

It's my party
I'll cry if I want to

Big boys don't cry
As if nothing seems to matter
Big boys don't cry
Oh, yeah, well then why do I
Big boys don't cry
Because nothing in this world Ever matters
