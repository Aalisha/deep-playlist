Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Yeah
Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Bop-Bop Yeah

You forgot when we were strange
Yeah somewhere we got caught
Now every little bird is tame
Their wings are clipped and gulled
Fear puts your heart on ice
For some other rainy day
You only know that your alive
When I melt the ice away

My life, my dreams my everything
Are all yourrrrrrs, baby
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'cause living only happens when you wait

If you go
If you stay
Sometimes better breaking, baby
In the sun
Before its gone
