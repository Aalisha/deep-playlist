Yeah, yeah, yeha, yeah
My love
Here I am reaching out for ya
But there's nothing to reach for
Guess my mind don't belive what my eyes have seen
The blames you gave, you know, and I know
That nobody, wants your, wishy, washy ways
Your mama raised from a child
And spent no time worth while
And I feel, you really come to nothing no
You've gotta change, your style of life
You've gotta change, your style of life
