They say a man can be the coldest coldest
thing on earth
but nothing hurts like a woman
with dreams that don't involve you

What happened to all my dreams
you just trade them in for material things
just because your friends said you deserve
your own
how could you let them break up our happy home
bags are packed and you're on your way
this has got to be the saddest day
can I change your mind girl I'm hurting inside
...
