I never knew what a kiss could mean
Until the first time I kissed you
You took my love in the palm of your hand
And showed me what a woman could do

Now I don't want sugar coated loving
Just silver tongue tenderness
You gotta give me a certain satisfaction
The kind of love you seal with a kiss

Spit it out [(spit it out)], spit it out [(spit it out)], spit it out
If you don't like it
Spit it out [(spit it out)], spit it out [(spit it out)], spit it out
If you don't like it

I can remember, I can recall
When I first set my eyes on you
I'll never forget the thrill of it all
Dreaming of the things we could do
