I can't begin to count the times
I have been by myself
I lie wake my lonely room
Tells me there's no one else
No one else

I reach for the light
It shines above my head
Reveals the bed that you're not in
I reach for the light
It shines across the room
And brings to mind what might have been

I tell myself I'm better off
No one can have me now
I see your crumpled photograph
It makes me laugh aloud
...
