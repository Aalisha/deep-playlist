I was a fool
Too blind to see
I turned my back
On all your needs
What a price
I almost let you get away

You're like the precious air I breathe
Without your love
I'm not complete
Now, I know
And my forever starts today

'Cause it's alright now with me
Yes, it's alright now, you see
I'll be all you'll ever need
This time

I can believe in who I am
Now that you're back with me again
I can see
That what is meant will always be

Let me reach out
And take your hand
I'll make you know
I am your man
