I remember the nights we spent under city lights
This feelings got the best of me
We were floating along to the sounds of a dead end town
but now that's just a memory

I can't figure you out, you've got more fight in you
than anybody else
And here's the part where I start to make my own damn decisions
and make a name for my self

I'll never be what you want
I wouldn't change any part of me
Just to make you stay
You had a piece of my heart
But not enough to just run away
'Cause I know what's best for me

Take all your big plans and throw them away
I've got something in mind before we go separate ways
...
