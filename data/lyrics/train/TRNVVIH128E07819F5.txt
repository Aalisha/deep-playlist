It's 4 in the morning July of '69
Me & my sister
We crept down like shadows
They're bringing the moon right down to our sitting-room
Static & silence & a monochrome vision

They're dancing around
Slow puppets silver ground
& the world was watching with joy
We hear a voice from above & it's history
...
