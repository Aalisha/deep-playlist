Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time

We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
...
