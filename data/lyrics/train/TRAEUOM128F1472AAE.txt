I think that living here is gonna be bad for my lungs
And what to do
When it's five to two
And my bar tab has been rung
Well I forgot to make it seem like I still care
But you keep coming back
Coming back
My God, you're so unaware
That I've got you

I told you once, and I told you twice and it's not enough
He's got a price
He sells advice
When times get tough
Like, "don't get caught in compromising positions"
Well, thanks a lot!
But now I'm caught
