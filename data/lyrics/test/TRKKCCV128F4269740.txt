I've gotta be breaking up with everything I know
If I wanna break ground with anything, I've got to show
Cause if there's one person in the world I've got to please,
It's me, not you
I've got to stand up for what I gotta say
Gotta be lettin my inner light show me the way
To be as much of me as I can let myself be until my dyin day

Cause I (y e a) won't sell myself, won't sell myself to you
I (y e a) won't sell myself to you

I was never the kind of person to follow like sheep
I'm not gonna lie in the bed you made for me
