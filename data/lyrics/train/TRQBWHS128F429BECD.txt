The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtle doves
While the moon was shining down

I asked her then I asked her when
The wedding bells would ring
She said, oh dear, it seems so clear
That this could happen here

Yeah, you are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue eyed Jane
I love you so
