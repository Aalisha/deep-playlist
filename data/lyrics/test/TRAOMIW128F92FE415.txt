Thought that I'd truly found someone,
Thought that the cause was unconditional,
I thought that the games we played we had gone,
With all of our consciousness,
Woke up last night,
In a sweat with fear,
For I dreamt she'd returned,
With everyone for me,
But now I condone,
That love for me,
Was only trickery.

She's left me half a man,
A broken man,
A twisted man,
If a man, is what I am.
