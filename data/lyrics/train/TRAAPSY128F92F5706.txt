The music business got really scared
When punks created their own alternative system
One that was honest and really cared
So they set out to destroy what punk had created
By dividing those involved
Choosing cult names and hatred
The gutter press said punks should spit and fight
And the puppet punks were fooled alright
They began to sniff aerosol and tubes of glue
Because the paper said that's what real punks do
Like spitting on bands covering them in shit
Even though they knew if they were playing, they wouldn't like it
