Hand of fate is moving
And the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet
And so what are you gonna do

Your tongue has frozen now
You've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn
Is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
...
