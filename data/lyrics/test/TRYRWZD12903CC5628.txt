The light shines bright to guide my way.
It keeps me strong for one more day.
Nights aren't as long as they used to be,
yet I fail to tame these haunting memories.

In the future you'll never see,
never see what you've done to me,
made me cry day after day,
I'll make you hurt, I'll make you pay.

In the past you've tried so hard
to make my life the wild card,
I dare you to see
just what it is you've done to me.

Only wishing for this closure
of your illicit exposure
yet I refuse to cry,
...
