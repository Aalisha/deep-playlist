Now there's a sweet young miss
That I like to kiss.
Listen folks and hear me.
She's not my only love.
I have another love
And she'll just have to share me.

But she's five foot tall,
Work boots and all.
But she already knows
She has some competition
In a composition
Called the Polka on an Old Banjo.

Polka on the Banjo
Make that five-string hot.
Polka on the Banjo
Give it all you've got.
Polka on the Banjo
