To see you coming 'round the bend
I just can't think of anything
That could make me smile like you can
When you're coming 'round the bend

I've been in love a time or two before
And all of that experience allows me to be sure
That you're the one
Sure as darkness brings the rising sun

To see you coming 'round the bend
...
