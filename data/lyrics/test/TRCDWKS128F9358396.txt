There? s a Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
Sitting there by the left turn line
The flag on his wheelchair flapping in the breeze
One leg missing and both hands free

No one? s paying much mind to him
The V.A. budget? s just stretched so thin
And now there? s more coming back from the Mideast war
We can? t make it here anymore

And that big ol? building was the textile mill
That fed our kids and it paid our bills
But they turned us out and they closed the doors
'Cause we can? t make it here anymore

You see those pallets piled up on the loading dock
They? re just gonna sit there? til they rot
? Cause there? s nothing to ship, nothing to pack
Just busted concrete and rusted tracks

Empty storefronts around the square
There? s a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
You don? t come down here unless you? re looking to score
We can? t make it here anymore

The bar? s still open but man it? s slow
The tip jar? s light and the register? s low
The bartender don? t have much to say
The regular crowd gets thinner each day

Some have maxed out all their credit cards
