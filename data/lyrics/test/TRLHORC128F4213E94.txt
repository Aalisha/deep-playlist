I’ve been waiting by the radio for someone like you
But the people that are calling in today are few and far between
You were listening

But every day I have to call into this show
Last week I decided to give it a go
I caught your ear when I said

So I guess I’ve got nothing to lose at this request
I want a girl who doesn’t like to dress to impress
A girl with a radio heart
A girl with a radio heart
We’ve never met but we’ve never been apart
A girl with a radio heart
