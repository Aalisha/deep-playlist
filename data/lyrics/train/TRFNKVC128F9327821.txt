Hey honey, listen
I got to tell you
It's been too many lonely days
and too many sleepless nights

I gave you everything you said you needed, ...
I gave you your time, your space
by now you should know what it's all about.

What can a man do?
when a woman is all he's got (bis)

Everytime I see you
I get wrapped up in my dreams
My days are getting loneler baby
since you bagged your bags to leave
