Sometimes it isn't so easy
To have a mind of your own
I can imagine why sometimes
You lose control
Don't treat me like a stranger
I can help you more than you know
I'll just wait until you feel like
Letting go

You're never alone
I'll be right here waiting
I'll be here, I won't disappear
I'm waiting in the wings
You're never alone
If you need something
I'm out of view but I'm watching you
Waiting in the wings

You've got a lot of secrets
Don't keep them all to yourself
