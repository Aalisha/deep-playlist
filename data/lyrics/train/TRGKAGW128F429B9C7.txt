Well keep our eyes so close to the sun 
that we cannot see all the damage we've done 
to not just ourselves. There is no way well make it. 
I know were going under as well.
And well keep our ears so close to the beat 
that we cannot hear you. And we wont move our feet 
to the sound of it all going down in flames. 
Lets put this fire out. Lets put this fire out.

Well well. Were a heartbeat away from hell. 
I know, and its easy enough to tell. 
You know we are a heartbeat away from having no heartbeat at all.

So lets keep the taste locked up in our teeth. 
We wont let it seep out; no we wont let it leak. 
You cant let it show, so maybe you just play your role 
in making sure that nobody knows.
