In the temple [(I was an offering)]
Of the heartless [(I was an offering)]
I was humbled [(I was an offering)]
And reborn into a God

My dear a sensitive soul is just
A tyrant who enslaves
All those around him
To make certain he is hurt always

I don't need a reason baby
Put your arms around me
Hold me real close
Clap me in irons
Come on Caligulove me
...
