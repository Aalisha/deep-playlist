On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind
Too long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone

Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone
