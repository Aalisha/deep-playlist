Shot rings out in the midday sun
Through the kitchen and past my mum
How can I live this way, how can it be done
Want to live like a man not prey on the run
All for a dollar do I find myself
With my eye on my back, never sleeping well
Looking for a way that will get me out
To a place where I don't have to hide and kill
Ticket comes my way from my uncle Jake
Yeah a one way ticket to the USA
