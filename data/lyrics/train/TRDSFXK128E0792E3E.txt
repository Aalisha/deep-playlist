I'm so tired of falling in love, finding it easier to fall out
I can't deny it
I feel it inside, oh, cupid's fire
Oh, you can't hide

I'm falling in love again, ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again and this time it's with you
When I fall, it's always the same
And I'm so tired of playing this game, oh

It's been so long now since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down, I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you now, I just wanna be sure
That you won't hurt me, oh, can you promise me that?

Falling in love again, ain't nothing I can do
