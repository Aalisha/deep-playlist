One more chance to write the book
And one more chance to take the stage
One more chance to set the hook
And one more chance to turn the pages
One more chance to get it right
And one more chance to right the wrongs
One more chance to make it tight
And one more chance to write the songs

One situation we're in
Dont you know, dont you wanna come with me?
Dont you know, dont you wanna come with me?
One more destination we may never see until we...
Rise again, as we reach up to the sun
We will try again
Until this race is won
Give me one more chance...

One more chance to feel alive
One more chance to wind up dead
...
