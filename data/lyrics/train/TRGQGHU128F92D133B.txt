I don't know why, 
I love ya like I do.
After all the changes, 
You put me through.

You stole my money, 
And my cigarettes.
And I haven't seen, 
How to? yet.

[Chorus:]
I wanna know, 
Won't you tell me, 
I'd love to stay, 
Hey, hey, hey.
[End Chorus]

Take me to the river, 
Wash me down.
Won't you cleanse my soul?
Put my feet on the ground.
