White power synonym for coward
Hope you enjoyed your stay
This is your final hour
Terminated lease
Cut off like deadweight
Good bye and good riddance to you
And to all of your hate

Hate crime the product of weak minds
Undernourished thought its ignorance defined
Sheep in wolves clothing
Bred from self loathing
You only hate them because you hate yourself

Your crippled followings a tattered hand me down
I'll try not to crack a smile as you send in the clowns
You can reminisce about the days when you felt proud
