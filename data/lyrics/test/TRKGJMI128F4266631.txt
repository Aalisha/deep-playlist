I wrote this song for you
to say i'm sorry
I know that I was wrong and
you don't like me
Why, why, why
Must you feel this way?
I wish I had the words
I needed to say

'Cause you and me
We disagree
On everything and everyone
I only want to be your friend again

I hear you're blaming me
for all your problems
