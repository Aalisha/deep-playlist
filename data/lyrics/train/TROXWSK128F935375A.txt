Standing at the door of the pink flamingo, crying in the rain.
It was a kind of so-so love, and i'm gonna make sure it never happens again.
You and i, it had to be the, standing joke of the year.
You were a sleeparound, a lost-and-found and not for me i fear.
I tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt, and me in a suit, well it just wasn't me.
You're used to wearing less, and now your life's a mess, so insecure you see.
I put up with all the scenes, and this is one scene thats gonna be played my way.
Take your hands, off me.
I don't belong, to you, you see.
Take a look, at my face for the last time.
I never knew you, you never knew me.
