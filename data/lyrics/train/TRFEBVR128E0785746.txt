This thing called love, i just can't handle it
this thing called love, i must get 'round to it
i ain't ready
crazy little thing called love
This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
it cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night
it swings, it jives
it shakes all over like a jellyfish
i kinda like it
crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
