Another drop falls from a flower
And it seems it could take an hour
(I'm) drowning I can't breathe
I can't cope with this bleak sensation
I feel killed by anger and frustration
This won't be our last good-bye

A blast of wind has blown out your candle
It's a pain that I could't handle
Tears are bursting out of my bleeding eyes
I cant't cope with this situation
...
