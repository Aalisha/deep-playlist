As I watch the fiends they slaughter
I listen to their voices in awe
It's my destiny, death is calling me
I will burn down what is left
They will suffer when I stand
I will summon lives, I will end all life
For those who desire to tyrannize
For those who slay to prevail to live
Ride along my side and we will
For those who live in peace so lifelessly
For those who run and hide from their enemies
