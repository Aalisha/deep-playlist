Mmm
Mh hmm

Oh oh
Oh uh...

Just one moment
In the blink of an eye
Did I miss it?
Then you said your goodbye

Heaven help me
There's a hole in my head
Cuz my last memories
Were the words that you said

Said you didn't wanna lose me
You said you needed time to breath
So tell me what the hell do I do now...

Left an open door
Can't use words no more
Quietly insane
Till I see ya, till I see ya

I can hardly wait
Patience has been great
...
