Ode to the guy read about in the news
Born by mistake he was born to lose
Never had much luck
With the pounds and the pence
Blamed everybody else
He said he never had a chance
Ship on the waves hole in my side
One foot in the grave and it's just my size

21st century crime in the city
And you're looking guilty as hell
...
