Haunted by your regrets
you're trying to escape from reality
Torn between love and them
you're running from a steal away from me tell me when
All is said and done (where do you go for love)
where do you go for love
So lonely and confused you feel so out of place
Remember, I'm only a prayer away
I've been waiting here, tryna make it clear
I want you to see you can come home (please tell me)
When will you realize, love never dies
You can always come home (shoopbadowaoooweeooo)
You feel like you've gone too far and you're dying as you watch your bridges burn (yeah)
Now I've repaired the reach, my love's repaved the way for you to return
Come on tell me when
