Parisian skies
Shadows beneath your eyes
All we have now
(And the arc of your brow)

You came to leave these shores
An inkling in your pores
We came to bid farewell
The tears began to swell

Oh, I don't think she knew
I can't forget her

The dark withholds
And lives unfold
We always slept so well
Our bodies seemed to gel
...
