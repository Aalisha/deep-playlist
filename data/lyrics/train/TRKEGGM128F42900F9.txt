There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance
What would you think of me now

So lucky, so strong, so proud?
Never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in

Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
...
