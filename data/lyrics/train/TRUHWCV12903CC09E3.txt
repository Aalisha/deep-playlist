Everything I thought was true, turned into a lie
After all the time we spent, what is there to pry

This is my dawning day the old will change, with haste
Will you let our future fade away?
Lay beside the moonlit ocean, gazing into the sky
Then i cried up through the blackness, waiting for our reply
Its been so long since I saw you, but its been the time of my life
Now that its all over, I want you to go die
die
