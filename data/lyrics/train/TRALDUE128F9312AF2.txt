I'm running out of ways to make you see
I want you to stay here beside me
I won't be okay and I won't pretend I am
So just tell me today and take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back

It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind
Only love
It's so simple and you know it is
You know it is

We can't be to and fro like this
All our lives
You're the only way to me
...
