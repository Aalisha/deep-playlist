Bring that big bottom down
Bring that booty to the ground
Bring that big bottom down
Bring that booty to the ground

Shake that curly, girly, high
Way up in the sky
Shake that curly, girly, high
Way up in the sky

Bring that big bottom down
Bring that booty to the ground
Bring that big bottom down
Bring that booty to the ground

Shake that curly, girly, high
Way up in the sky
Shake that curly, girly, high
Way up in the sky, come on!

Check the technique, then I've got it
Checkin' all MC's mighty proud
And makin' them ladies shimmy shake
When it comes to shakin' he takes a break

You don't play, he gets there to the limit
Pretty girl, get up and get it
Just like that, girl, keep it comin'
And if you're leakin', I'll do the plumbin'

Yo, homie, your mother goes on in here
'Cause, baby, I'm thumpin' on thought, dear
So gimme that shimmy shake you left
Girl, give it up, don't make me bad

Shake that shimmy, baby
Shake that shimmy
Girl, go rock, rock that shimmy, baby
Shake, shake, shake, shake

Shake that shimmy, baby
Shake that shimmy
Girl, go rock, rock that shimmy, baby
Shake, shake, shake, shake

Shake that shimmy, baby
Shake that shimmy
...
