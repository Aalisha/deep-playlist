You know I can't stay at home
With all this time to kill
You know I can't sit still tonight
I've gotta make some noise
I'm jumping up and down
I've got to get out now
I wanna shout out loud

Oh you make me be alright
It's like the tippermost, toppermost high
Oh it's you - you do
Crack up your face and give us a smile
Because tonight I just wanna go wild
