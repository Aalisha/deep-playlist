If I gave you my soul
Would it make any matter?
And if I broke all my bones
Would you glue them back together?
If I gave you my eyes
Would you see it all my way?
And if I said I was wrong
Could I start on a new day?
Oh yeah

Now we get our ideas
When no words are spoken
Built it all up, now everything's broken
