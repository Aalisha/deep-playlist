Illusion, Illusion
Illusion, Illusion

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah

Hoping that I'll never have to say
It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion
Follow your emotions anywhere
Is it really magic in the air?

Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion
