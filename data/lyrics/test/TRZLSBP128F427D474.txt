Im so sick sick sick and tired
Of working just to be retired
I don't want to get that far
I don't want your company car
Promotions ain't my thing
Name badges are not interesting

Its much easier for me see
To stay at home with Richard and Judy

A way a way oh, oh oh, away from here
A way a way oh, oh oh, away from here
A way a way oh, oh oh, away from here
A way a way oh, oh oh, away from here

I'm fed up of early mornings
Wake up calls are getting boring round here
Feet dragging on the pavement
The same people with the same arrangements
*Irony* can be quite funny
Making other people money
