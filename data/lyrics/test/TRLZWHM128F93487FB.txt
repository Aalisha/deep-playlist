(Everlast)
Yo I? mma take it back to the old school like Red Dawn
And blow the fuck up like Lebanon
You ain? t my first or my second, you my thousandth born
And I put you on all that shit you on
The originator, kid, look what you done did
Snitched, told a fib, sent feds to the crib
I ain? t under arrest, I? m David Koresh
Bring a strap and a vest, send your mother my best
Bring all your big guns and your funeral clothes
Cause my rap? s gonna feel like six Wacos
Make a new set of laws and we? ll still break those
Get a new list of drugs, we will take those
Standing on the block in my b-boy pose
Nike sneakers on my feet and my wrist stay froze
Chilling on the corner in a b-boy stance
With a gun in my pants and some blood on my hands

(Slaine)
Once upon a time not too far in the past
When people said what they meant and lived life fast
There was a young man who was misled
By another motherfucker, this is what he said
Once upon a time less recently
I had to walk around with the piece with me
There was a young man who was misled
So I put the gun to his head, this is what I said
