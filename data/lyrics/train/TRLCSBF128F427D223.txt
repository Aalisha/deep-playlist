Call me a doctor of defense
Maybe I'm a fix (Baby I'm a mess)
A diagnosis you'll forget
Call me baby call me crazy, yeah yeah yeah
Take these pills everyday to kill your apathy for living
Yeah for living, yeah yeah

(This is) This is the sound of your body under fire
(These are) These are my eyes finding you in the dark
We are the voices of an underground choir
Save your breath you won't be heard

I found the villain in your bed
A blanket full of lust (a pillow you can trust)
So is this what you call love?
