All hail the Beauty Queen!
At the top of the heap, it's so pretty up there,
Yellow veins in the clouds eliciting affairs.
Burning holes in the pavement with her 1, 2 stilettos,
Ruby red lips, and thigh-high innuendos.
She speaks without care, there's paint everywhere...

This corpse is a cover girl
Lounging beside a gutter romance.
She smells of skinny cigarettes and cheap perfume...
