There you are again
I see you all the time
We haven't really met yet,
But you know, I don't mind
'Cuz I think today's the day
I'm gonna go right up and say to you
Would it be alright
If I called you up sometime?

There you go again
I let you get away
At least I've got more time
To think of what I might say (like)
"Couldn't we be good" (or maybe)
"Don't you think that we should find
Some quiet little place where we'd make love all day?"

Come and talk to me
