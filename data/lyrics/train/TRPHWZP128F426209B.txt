Even though you want it
You really shouldn't think about it
Treason is a tar pit
It's so tacky to preserve alone

Can you live like a crow? There's your answer
As you pick at my bones with your friends and
Their barren tongues won't fill your lungs

Love tends to dry
 (And you can find it in a heartbeat)
In hands that don't try
 (And leave it tangled in the bed sheets)

Love tends to dry
 (You burn your bridges in the backseat)
In hands that don't try
 (And show up widowed on the high street)

Come on, say you've done it
Though we don't have to talk about it
The stains left on the carpet
Scream loud enough for all to know

Do your legs fail the floor? There's your answer
A mistake with a sword needs a ransom
But you've got no jazz to have the cash
...
