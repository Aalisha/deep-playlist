I can't imagine all the people that you know
And the places that you go
When the lights are turned down low
And I don't understand all the things you've seen
But I'm slipping in between
You and your big dreams
It's always you
In my big dreams

And you tell me that it's over
Wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover
And your restless, and I'm naked
You gotta get out
You can't stand to see me shaking
No
Could you let me go?
I didn't think so

And you don't wanna be here in the future
So you say the present's just a pleasant interruption to the past
And you don't wanna look much closer
'Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed
And it did
Because of me

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone
And I'm sleeping in your living room
But we don't have much room to live

I had these dreams in them I learned to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rock star
And there was hope in me that I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
Well, I don't think I care
And if I hurt you
Then I'm sorry
Please don't think that this was easy
