all these politics, it's a deception
falling on america's weak
they say we're keeping ourselves down
we sold out on half ass trailer park dreams
so now we're living with rednecks, racists -blk/white hatred
i'm trying so hard to love my nation
underfed, overbred, i just can't get ahead
it's not about the races or the revelations

people shooting up the blocks because of empty pockets
fighting with the cops because of empty pockets
...
