Tonight, I, I just want to talk to the ladies, oh fellows your cool but girls

If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him,

Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know

Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation

But whatever it is, you should try to stay together

You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember

Well, today its not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey

Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved about
him

It was the real small things, go on and laugh but its true

You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house

But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries

And helping in the yard and painting and repairing and huh, paying the bills

But you know now, all I have is memories and regrets
