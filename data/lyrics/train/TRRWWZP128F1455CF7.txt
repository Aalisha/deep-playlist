Record boss said we would be a smash
Yeah, go straight to number one
He talked of hits and tours and lots of cash
And all the time it wasm't on
And I beleived every word was true
Yeah I swallowed every line
I believed every word he said
And I didn't find out in time

(Chorus)
We were betrayed, betrayed, betrayed
Betrayed, betrayed by rough trade lies
