You may find,
That my appetite gets its way
It keeps on growing and growing,
Before you know it I'm a bee swallowing prey

And it is clear,
It is clear
It's as clear as a fucking bell
The more I wear off on you,
The more I seem to wear your smell

Come on, get away and save yourself (come on)
Turn away and don't look back (come on)
Get away and save yourself (come on)
Grey skies are turning black

'Cause I will always,
Hurt everyone I love
If I were you,
I'd run away
'Cause it's true that,
I will always,
Hurt everyone I love
...
