You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give...
Won't lie and say this lovin's best...
Leave us in emotional peace
Take a walk, taste the rest
No take a rest

I see you digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
No need to live in a lean-to
Your troubles must be seen to seen to
Money like it's paper, with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis
Though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper

Walking through the suburbs though not exactly lovers
You're a couple, 'specially when your body's doubled
Duplicate and then you wait for the next Kuwait

Karmacoma... Jamaica and Roma
