Could you hear me, if I called your name outloud? Could you see me, with you head struck in a cloud?
How can you see, that I'm in love you, if you just walk on by, Head up high! Hung up on yourself! Oh! Fall in love (fall in love) lady love (lady love)
Be my lady, please lady love.
You could touch me, if you would just put out your hand, I'm always near you (always near you) trying hard as I can, To make you know, Dear, that I'm in love with you
But you ignore me so,
Runing to and fro!
