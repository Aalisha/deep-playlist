I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
Now I'm blaming you for everything

No more holding it in
How many years can I pretend
And nothing ever goes the way it should

No more sitting in this place
Hoping you might see it my way
'Cause I don't think you ever understood
That what I'm looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

I'm so far away
I've been changin', but you'll never see me now
(I'm so far away)
Now I'm blaming you for everything

No more waiting for the end
