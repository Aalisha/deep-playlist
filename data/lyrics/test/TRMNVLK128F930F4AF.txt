I'm going on a date tonight
To try to fall out of love with you
I know, I know, this is a crime
But I don't know what else to do

My love, you're in a magazine
My love, you're doing fine, you're on tv
You work hard and then you run away
From chicago to cleveland you made me pay
You made me pay

When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing
I would trade my mother to hear you sing
When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing
...
