I got your runaway smile in my piggybank baby
Gonna cash it right in for a new Mercedes
You were worth the hundred thousand miles
But you couldn't stay awhile
I got your little brown shirt in my bottom drawer baby
And your little white socks in the top drawer
You were always leaving your shit around
And gone without a sound

Yeah I'm the first to fall
And the last to know

Where'd you go?
Now I'm heels over head
I'm hangin' upside-down
Thinkin' how you left me for dead

California bound
I got a first class ticket to a night all alone
And a front row seat up right by the phone
'Cause you're always on my mind
And I'm running out of time
I've got your hair on my pillow
And your smell in my sheets
And it makes me think about you
