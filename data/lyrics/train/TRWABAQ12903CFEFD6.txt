Life is full of lots of up and downs
And the distance feels further
When you're headed for the ground
And there is nothing more painful
Than to let you're feelings take you down
It's so hard to know the way you feel inside
When there's many thoughts and feelings that you hide
But you might feel better
If you let me walk with you by your side

And when you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
