We're walking within a shadow
Where echoes of different times resound
Looking for memories to relive
In yesterdays that can't be found

Through different eyes we keep looking for what we lack
Changing minds take us away, and you can't go back

And staring into ageless eyes
That shared secrets too dark for light
...
