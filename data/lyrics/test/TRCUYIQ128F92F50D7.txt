I want to beat you up
I don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry
I want to take you down
I know that you will see in glory

I want to beat you in
I'll make you feel my sorrow
I want to take you out
I'll come find you tomorrow

Every time you leave
I go down
I'll just wait for you to turn around
And kick your head in

I want you to let it drop
I don't care, 'cause I won't feel sorry
I want to mess you up
...
