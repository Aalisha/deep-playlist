My grandma and your grandma were
Sit-tin' by the fire. - My grandma told
Your grandma "I'm gonna set your flag on fire."

Talk-in' 'bout, Hey now ! Hey now ! I-KO, I-KO, un-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-n?. - Jock-a-mo fee na-n?

Look at my king all dressed in red
I-KO, I-KO, un-day. I betcha five dollars he'll kill youdead
