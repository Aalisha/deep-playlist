I can't stand this tension
I'm pulling out my hair
I sweat blood, day and night for you
You know this can't be fair

Tearing at my very soul
Wounding me with words
Shaking, as I lose control
I must be on the verge

You've even got me crawling on my hands and knees for you
I'm just your private clown, and there's no trick that I won't do

Ah, baby you've got me jumping like a monkey
I'm so crazy, I'll do any trick for you
