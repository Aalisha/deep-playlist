In the bible, one thousand years B.C.
there's a story of ancient history
'bout a fellow who was strong as he could be
till he met a cheatin gal who brought him tragedy.

Oh, run Samson run, Delilah's on her way.
Run Samson run, you ain't got time to stay.
Run Samson run, on your mark you better start,
I'd sooner trust a hungry lion than a gal with a cheatin heart.
