Oh oh
Can we try
Oh

Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay

Listen
Sit back relax your mind, your dinner is waiting
The more I see you girl my heart beat is pacing
New lovers mentally we knew what we were thinking
No waiting all night long let's start the love making
Can we try

Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
I love you baby come with me
'Cause I love you
Tonight I'm gonna make you stay
I'm gonna make you stay

Can we try to make up for the lonely daze?
