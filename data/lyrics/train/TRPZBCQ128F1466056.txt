Smells on the air
See there, it's crushing
The final impression
The stains on the paper
Where words fell like water
Unearth all the changes
That never did matter
I think its beginning to freeze here

Caught in the rage
And the fire of things
All the brightness that burns me
I'm fumbling through
Like a child in the dark
When the nakedness comes
I am shocked by the colour
The glorious way your skin

Comes alive
And I never thought we'd make it back so soon
Might be nice
But I knew you'd be your own destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Here, please forgive me
How could we escape
All the bitterness
...
