A drunk, and hungry bear losing his hair, 
Living on a boat right off the coast he said, 
"Ain't you got nothing else to do?
Just look at my head son.
Is it lost, or under fire, 
It's my only one.
Ain't you got nothing else to do?"
Well, sir I was bought for the lessons I was taught, 
But the Bull and the Goat, they tried
To drown me in a moat.
So, I'll be on my way, with a kindly "Good day."
It's enough to say
You're simply in my way.
(I got something else to do.)
