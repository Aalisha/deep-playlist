You're the infection, my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew that, I knew it

You're basic, but hard to define
Simple, yet somehow sublime
Know you will strike again
I knew that, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumb ass song
Yeah, that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
that's all that you will ever be
