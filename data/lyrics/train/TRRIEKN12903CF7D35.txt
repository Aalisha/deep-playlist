Ummmmmm...
Company always on the run
Destiny is a rising s... un
Oh...
I was born 6 gun in my hand
Behind a gun
I'll make my final stand... hey
That's why they call me

Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die, oh
Till the day I die
Till the day I die

Rebel souls
Deserters we are called
Chose a gun
