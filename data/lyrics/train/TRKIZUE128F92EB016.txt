A shapeless piece of steel
That's all I claim to be
This hammer pounds to give me form
This flame, it melts my dreams

I glow with fire and fury
As I'm twisted like a vine
My final shape, my final form
I'm sure I'm bound to find

So dream a little
Dream for me
In hopes that I'll remain

And cry a little
Cry for me
So I can bear the flames

And hurt a little
Hurt for me
My future is untold

But my dreams are not the issue here
For they, the hammer holds

And the water, it cools me gray
...
