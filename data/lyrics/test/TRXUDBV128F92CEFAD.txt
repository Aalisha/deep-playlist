I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try
Any love

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love
...
