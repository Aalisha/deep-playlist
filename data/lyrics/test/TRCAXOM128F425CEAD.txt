Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
Yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh oh, yeah

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria
In excelsis Deo

Ooh, no, yeah, yeah
Shepards, why this jubilee
Why your joyous song prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Ohh
...
