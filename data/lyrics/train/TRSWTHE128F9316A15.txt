Where are you hiding, I'm searching for you.
Are you so scared that you don't know what to do?
Say what you want I believe it's nothing new.
No tears to she'd it's just the game between us two.

Invitation inside of these walls.
Revelations of destiny calls.
Your endless screams I still hear them in dreams.
