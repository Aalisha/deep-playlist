Let the telephone ring, it's about to get physical
It's just you and me on a late night creep
Plan on making you moan but first let's get the mood right
I got the '76 Don Perignon and a dime bag of smoke
So let's get it on, come on

It's okay, it's alright, we're gonna do it tonight
It's okay, it's alright, we're gonna do it tonight

Get the bath water ready, it's about to get kinky
I imagine that body so soft, I won't know 'til you take your clothes off
Don't you be afraid, I wanna be your sex slave
