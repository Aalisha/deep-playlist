[Master P]
Dear Mr. President i live in the hood
Where people live bad
But say its all good
And my homies slanging and robbing
Caught a misdameanor felonies
We cant survive it
And three strikes niggas out it
But we dont give a fuck cause niggas down here bout it bout it
One nation in god we trust
But then you say Saddam ain't gon fuck with us
(ugghhhhh)
Now you see how we feel
Niggas set trip, ride and gang bang
Thats how they get killed
You run from the press
We run from killers and jackers
And wear bullet proof vest
...
