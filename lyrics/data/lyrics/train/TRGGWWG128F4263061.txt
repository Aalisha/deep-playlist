*** verse: 1
Em		 d/f#		g c
We've known her ever since she was a kid
Em	 d	 c	 g
She was the kind of girl who repeats her mistakes
Em	 d/f#	 g	 c
Her parents never minded what she did
Em	 d	 c	 g
She was a fallen angel with dirt on her face
Am	 g/b	 c	 d
But past a certain point she stayed behind
Am	 g/b	 c	 d
The two of us could never read her mind
Am	 g/b 	 c	 d
The million ways she had of killing time

*** chorus:
Em	 d	 c
So we just gave up
Em d c
