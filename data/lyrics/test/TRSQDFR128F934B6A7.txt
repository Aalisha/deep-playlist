This world is a cemetery. Often I visit my plot.
And listen to the winds ripe with trichloroethylene.
This stagnant "air". Sometimes it speaks to me.

of manufactured scraps foretelling human downfall.
Grisly. Obscene. Toxic. Motherfucking desert.

Sifting through the ghosts of human consumerism
I find myself searching for body parts
