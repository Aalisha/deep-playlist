I'm gonna follow you, 'til I wear you down
I'm gonna follow you, 'cause this here's my town
You don't know these streets the way that I do (I do, I do)
You can't turn it on and off the way that I do (I do, I do)
Ooo, ooo...

I'm gonna follow you, 'til I know your timing
You'll turn some corner soon, and find you can't get by me
You don't know these streets the way that I do (I do, I do)
You can't turn it on and off the way that I do (I do, I do)
...
