I can't do it
I can't conceive
You're everything
You're trying
To make me believe
'Cause this show
Is too well designed
Too well to be held
With only me in mind

And how
How am I different?
How, how am I different?
How, how am I different?

I can't do it
So move along
Do you really want to wait
Until I prove you wrong?
