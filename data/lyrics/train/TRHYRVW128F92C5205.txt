Is she goin' out tonight, is she wearin' your shirt,
is she driving your car.
She was the one who was most likely to,
but she never got through and she never got far.
And if we look at her yearbook picture,
I'm sure we'll see a face that looks a lot like now.
She always wanted to be accepted.
She was only rejected anyhow. And...

Renee remains the same.
Renee she'll never change.
She's the same.
