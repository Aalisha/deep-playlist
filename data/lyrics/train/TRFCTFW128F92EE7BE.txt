Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughing
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get there
We'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna
Put you way down here
And you'll start crying
Ninety-six tears
Cry, cry
And when the sun comes up
...
