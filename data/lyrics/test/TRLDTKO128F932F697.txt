Well, there was seven years between us
Seems that all my friends were right
That we can? t survive on your bedroom eyes
And a Spanish guitar

When we started this it was paradise
Not just Bethnal Green
And it's just not right this waiting game
Making a cuckold of me

I can be as cruel as you
Fighting fire with firewood
I can be as cruel as you
Fighting lies with lies
(If you need time)

And it? s just not like me to lash out
But enough is enough
Tell me what the others can do
That I can't
