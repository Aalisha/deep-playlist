When passion's lost and all the trust is gone
Way too far, for way too long
Children crying, cast out and neglected
Only in a world so cold, only in a world this cold
Hold the hand of your best friend
Look into their eyes then watch them drift away
Some might say, we've done the wrong things
For way too long, for way too long

Fever inside the storm
So I'm turning away
Away from the names (calling you names)
Away from the stones (throw sticks and stones)
'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us

Keep your thorns
'Cause I'm running away
Away from the games (fucking head games)
Away from the space (hate this head space)
The circumstances of a world so cold

Burning whispers, remind me of the days
I was left alone, in a world this cold
Guilty of the same things, provoked by the cause
I've left alone, in a world so cold

Fever inside the storm
So I'm turning away
Away from the names (calling you names)
Away from the stones (throw sticks and stones)
