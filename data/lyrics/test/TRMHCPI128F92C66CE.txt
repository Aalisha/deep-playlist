Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me anymore
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get my anywhere

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night
