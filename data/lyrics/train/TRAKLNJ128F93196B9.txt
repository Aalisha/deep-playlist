The reaper stood before him in the room
His melancholy smile matched the gloom
He tried to rise but fell back where he lay
Tried to speak but stumbled as the sentence slipped away.

The room grew far away and strangely still
He caught the reaper's eye and felt a chill
He thought he saw his mother's smiling face
As sunlight filtered softly through the yellowed curtain lace.

He thought back to the days when he was young
He heard the children's choir in which he'd sung
His letter floated softly to the floor
The reaper took his hand and led him gently through the door.

We Must Cross The River

Take my hand and I will lead you safely
There's no need to be dismayed
Though it's dark there will be no danger
There's no need to be afraid.
If you wear the cross your wife once gave you
You will find that it is blessed
Should you find that you are growing weary
You may lean on me and rest.

We must cross the river
We must cross the river
We must cross the river
Together.
