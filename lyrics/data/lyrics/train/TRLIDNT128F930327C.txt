Want you to stay in a subtle way
Like I'm walking again, all on me
Step slowly, you know that you fall between
Dark places, what a simple web we weave

We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Know my soul
Know my soul
Well, all hail
Prison queen
Iron bars
Iron heart
Iron bars
Everything
