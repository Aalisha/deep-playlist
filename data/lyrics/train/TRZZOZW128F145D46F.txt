Just for you I could fly
Just for you I could walk the oceans
I would cross all divides
To satisfy your whims and notions

For you I could change
Just for you I could beat the system
I could take every blow
Survive upon a poor man's wisdom

And if you want I'd chase the world away
And when you cry I'd kiss the tears away
...
