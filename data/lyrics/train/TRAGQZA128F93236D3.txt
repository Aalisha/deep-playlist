By Karen Brooks and Randy Sharp

Come To Me when her lies have broken love down
Come To Me when your heart is no longer bound
Come To Me and know you'll never be lonely
If you'll only
Come To Me

Take these dreams of mine and make them come true
Take my word no one can love you more than I do
Take my hand and know you'll never be lonely
If you'll only
Come To Me
Come To Me

Careless love is at best unfair
