And i would surrender the last empire tonight.
this has gone far enough to remove these walls that stand for you.

to never return here again.
(for once we are alive)
the fire in the sky . . .
to never return here with you.
(just once you are mine)
will lead us tonight.
this is where we've always belonged.
a place we thought we'd lost for so long.

set the fire the flame has gone.
saddest eyes, the lies i shunned.
its on fire the flame has won.
and in time you will see what you've done.
