Acquired mind with acquired someone
You don't know it feels so low
Said, she left he or he left you
Still not quite sure what to do

No words left just left enough
The only time I used to have
I just wished that I could lose it

No words left just left enough
The only time I used to have
I just wished that I could lose it

Acquired mind with acquired someone
You don't know it feels so low
Said, she left he or he left you
Still not quite sure what to do

No words left just left enough
The only time I used to have
I just wished that I could lose it
