Simmonds/Peterson 
Mystifying Music ASCAP/Savoy Brown Music 
Everybody says they want it 
When they think you got it 
If you don't know you have it 
Everything is just fine 
It's a blanket situation 
This life of mine 

People say get real 
Get a job, get a life 
Stop wasting your time 
You only get one try
