I know there's no hope in holding up this weight.
It just won't float.
Man, I tried, but the tide.
It knows no sides.
If that's what's not fair, 
Then what could be wrong with my life?
(If that's what's not fair, 
Then what could be wrong with my life?)

Maybe she needs love
To put the bottle down.
