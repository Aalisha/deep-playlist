Bring your pipes and bring your swords
I'll meet you in the lowland
Tune your banjo, don't be late
It's time we all we're going

Swing your arms and clap your hands
Gather 'round and sing
Round and round till we fall down
Doing the lowland fling

I'll meet you in the lowland
Meet you in the lowland

Leave your troubles and I'll leave mine
...
