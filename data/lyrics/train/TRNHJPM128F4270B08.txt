(Together, together)
Oh, oh we could be on a desert
Lost without a place (place) to (to) go (go)
And we're so in love, in love with each other
That we wouldn't even (even) know (know)

(Oh, I) don't care (I don't care)
Anyplace, anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long as) just as long
(We are there) as we are there, baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just you and me) just you and me
(Woah) oh, how (happy) happy (we'll) we'll be (be)
