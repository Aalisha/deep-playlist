While you're honky-tonkin' 'round
All you do is run me down
Now we're parted
How cold hearted can you get?

You're tellin' all your friends
What a rascal I have been
Now we're parted
How cold hearted can you get?

I remember back when I was
Tall hog at the trough
Now my money's gone
And you have really fluffed me off

You're giving me the blame
