Give me a reason not to keep sleeping
When I'm awake I feel like I am dreaming
The world is shrinking, every street's the same thing
I can't reach that far but there are people disappearing

How can I pretend to know my own mind
The more questions I ask the more I find
I'm lost at home, out of time
The coins I flip land on their side

I'm holding my breath at your end of town
