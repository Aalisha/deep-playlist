Base
Jaxx
You keep on giving me the hold up
(Hold up)
You know I wish you'd make your mind up
(Mind up)
'Cuz when we get it on its so, so
(So, so)
You used to be my Romeo
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
'Cuz you see my dear I have had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo, yo
(Yo, yo)
You used to be my Romeo
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(Hoo, hoo, yea, ooo)
Let it all go
(You used to be my Romeo)
