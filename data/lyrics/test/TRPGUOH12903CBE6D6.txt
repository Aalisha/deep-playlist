Eyes of envy stares at me they hope I fail
Anything to make me disappear
All the lies, all the tricks deception
You want what you cannot have

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

Kill them all
I will kill them all
If they come too close to me
Kill the enemy

For many years they have tried to take my throne
But when I dress for war they retreat
All the words, all the talk behind my back
You will shake like a leaf if we meet
