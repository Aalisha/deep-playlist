(Spoken:
Take a lot a entertainers, sing songs
'Bout the things they experienced in life
Some entertainers sing songs that they-a,
seen other people experience in life
Well, I'm gonna tell you some of the things
I experienced in life)

The old lady got mad with me the other night
Packed that overnight grip
Got the house by myself, just me and the dog. Ha, ha
Sometime ya know that your animal layin' in the floor, lookin'
at you like, say, "Uh, you done messed up buddy"
It's that same old thang

(Sings)
Same old thang, baby where ya been?
Said, same old thing, woman where ya been?

Been gone two days, today
I'm sittin' here all alone
I been waitin' babe
Waitin' by my telephone

Said, same old thing
Woman where ya been?
It's that same old thing
Baby, where ya been?
