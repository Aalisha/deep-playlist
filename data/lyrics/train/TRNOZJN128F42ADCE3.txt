Smell the despair in the air tonight
Filling up your lungs as you cry for help
It's like guns in the middle of streets
Pointing at your head, I don't care to speak
Won't you understand my apathy, my insanity?

Watching you die
Watching you die
Your blood is on me
I'm watching you die
Watching you die
Your blood is on me
I'm watching you die

Watch as your life fades away
Your pain is masked by your decay
It's like acid dripping in
I see it burn but don't wipe the skin
It's not my fault once again
