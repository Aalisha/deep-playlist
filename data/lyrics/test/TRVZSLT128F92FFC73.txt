When Mom and Papa first laid eyes
On me right from the start
They knew right away a lover was born
I'd be breakin' lovers' hearts
(Breakin' lovers' hearts)

At a very early age, yeah, I began to show sign
That a stone cold lover was born
Lord, I'm gonna let it shine, yeah
(I'm gonna let it shine, yeah)

Girl, if I can't love you
A reel can make gumbo
A drunken man don't stumble
A seein'-eye dog can learn to lead the blind

A bee don't deal in honey
The Beatles ain't got no money
