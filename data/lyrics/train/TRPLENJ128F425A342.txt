[Verse 1: Izzy G]
May 21st my mama gave birth
I was growing up in the city
with the shitty, places where you didn't not
remember any faces with no free spaces
I was 5 years old when my dad left me ice cold
then to myself I told I ain't gonna fold
I'm gonna survive this shit, I ain't gonna quit
I was playing cool, cause I never went to school
I took a tool, and broke the rule
I was a fool
I was seven years, but I never dropped any tears
I lived with my mom and my older brothers
who was growing up one after the other
we still live in this got damn world
like I told I was never seen and heard
