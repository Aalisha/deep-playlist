Remember David's eyes
The way he used to hypnotize his young
Remember David's words
The words he said to us when we were small

Remember David's hair
The way his long hair fell across his brow
Remember David's smile
I wonder where he's gone to now?

The world keeps on turning
Everybody's asking questions
Tell me David, what's the secret?
Tell me David, what's the answer?

Remember David's eyes
The gray-green eyes he hides his world behind
And all the things he saw,
He saw for us when we were blind
