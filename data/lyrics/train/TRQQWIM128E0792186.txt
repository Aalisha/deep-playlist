Tonight I watched the lights go out in your house
Wondering how I could get so deep
And you could still get sleep
In vain I blame my trembling on the cold air
But I can't hide that I've relied on you
Like yellow does on blue

And you're my
Good feeling
I'm kneeling
Inside a room she paints me blue
And you are
My reason
For breathing
Inside a room she paints me blue, again
...
