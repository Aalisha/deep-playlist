Stay, you don't have to go
Please stay with me
Boy, I wanna play
You ain't gotta go, just stay with me

There ain't nobody here but you and me
And I must say I'm glad you're here with me
We're so close and I got it so bad
I wanna give you something that you never had

We're always together, we're never apart
You keep showing me new things, stealing my heart
I'm tired of holding back and taking it slow
Tonight's gon' be different, I'm just letting you know
'Cause I want you to

Stay, you don't have to go
