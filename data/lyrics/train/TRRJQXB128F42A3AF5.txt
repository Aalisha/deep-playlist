Here we go

I've fallen, yeah I've fallen before
I thought I knew exactly what was in store
When I met him got more than I bargained for
And I'm not overstating, over exaggerating
Horsing around or playing
When I'm saying I've

I've gone off the deepest end
Not jumping, diving in
He's a perfect ten times ten, times ten
And I'm head over heels
No, head over high heels
High heels

I'm dreaming in colors I've never seen
My heart is bursting wide at the seams
I've taken my smiling to the extremes
