One two, is this on?
Yo Jimmy hit me with that Triple H
Ha ha ha ha
Yeah you let the music keep playin' mister dumb shit
Yo tell me what time it is now
Yeah, just kickin' it up in here
It's our time
Yo, here comes trouble
Not gonna listen to anybody
Tell me who and what to be
Not tryin' to be like anybody
Draw the blood you make from me
Cause I lead the blind, lead the blind, lead the blind
Our time! Our time!
Our time, it's time
Our time! Our time! Our timmmmme!
Not lookin' back cause you've had enough (yeah)
You don't know what trouble is
Game of politics, sissy troubles (one time, read your mind)
All these rules, stupid rules
