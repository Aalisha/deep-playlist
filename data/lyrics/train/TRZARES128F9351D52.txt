I'm counting the street lights
It's all i can do
While driving myself crazy trying to get to you
Feels wrong at the right time
To reveal my hand
It's like i'm doing the worst i can
To make you understand

Maybe one day you will know
How hard it is for me to show my heart
And all the love
Running through my soul
Maybe one day you will know
...
