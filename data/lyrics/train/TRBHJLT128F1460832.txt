Gotta give you love oh cherry
Dance for me there's only you
Play the barrooms just for pennies
Wish I wasn't just passing through

Tell me your secrets, tell me no one way lyin' now
We are golden, we are golden
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone
Into the highways of thei night I roll alone
...
