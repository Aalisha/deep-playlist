Sitting in a rocket ship, perpetual motion
Takes me for a ride, I
Feeling teracoda
As I wake amongst the, moments of my life, I
Slipping into clean blue jeans I stumble

And when the morning finds the sun
You are with me now
And as the day begins to come
I'm telling you (ohÂ…) I'm still in love with you
