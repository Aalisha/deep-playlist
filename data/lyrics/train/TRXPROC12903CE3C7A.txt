If you can't decide, I should step aside
He is well and good and does what he should
But I just can't understand what you're doing with my hand
On the longest day of the year
This night should never end, no this night should never spend
Could you walk away?

Don't you touch me, just be cool
Don't you touch me, I'd fall over for you
