Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head
But I just want to live each day
To love her for what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind
But, very well, I believe I know you-very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can face-very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream
My woman want to be a superwoman
And I just had to say good-bye
Because I can't spend all my hours start to cry
But, very well, I believe I know you
