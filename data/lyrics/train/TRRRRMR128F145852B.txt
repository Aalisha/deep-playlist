Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up takin' over
Rock you, house you
People get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight
Off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People move on

And yes it's time to grow
Spent enough time to know
To believe in you is blind
You only tell us lies
So now that we've agreed
It's time to end your greed
The unanimous decision
Is to rock you

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up takin' over
Rock you, house you
People get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight
Off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People move on
People move on

You shake a million hands
Make a million plans
Then give a promise
To the poor
And millions to a war
We tried to beg and plead
Still you ignore our needs
So the only way to teach you
Is to rock you

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up takin' over
Rock you, house you
People get strong
(Come on people sing)
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight
Off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People move on
