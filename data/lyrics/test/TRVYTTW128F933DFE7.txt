When you're coming home and it's getting late
I was, on the ride of fate
Two eyes light up the screen
Ooo the prettiest face you've ever seen
You.oo in the depleting light
Tip toe through in the middle of the night
You say, I want what you got ooh

And the rocket launches at the sun.
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting by the telephone
Somebody in Kansas City loves me
Somebody is waiting too, all alone
