Jo:
Come join the party ' come on get up off your seat
Doesn't matter who you are, we all dance to the same beat
Come put your hands together ' shake your little feat

(Whay-ee-Yay-ee-oh!)

All:
Buenos tiempo ' with these friends of mine
Buenos tiempo ' we have good times
Buenos tiempo ' it can't get no higher
Buenos tiempo ' thru' the streets of fire!

Chorus:
And once you've started up
You're gonna dance until you drop
It's a feel good thing ' it's an S Club thing
And when the rhythm hits you you'll never wanna stop
...
