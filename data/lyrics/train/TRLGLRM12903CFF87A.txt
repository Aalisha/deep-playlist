From the soul to its waste
The Common hates his evil twin —
Everything invaded
In its simplicity

How did you get inside me?

Still all fascinated
Invaded — by everything

In the first morning light
The touch of death covering skies
Everything invaded
And all the fears inspired

How did you get inside me?
...
