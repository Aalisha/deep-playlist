my names billy jo mckay
i just turned 16 yesterday
im gonna get the nerve one day
to get outta here
my ma passed on 3 years ago they said
it was cancer and it took her slow
and ever since then i've been
sayin no to my daddy and my tears
now when you come down our road
you gotta watch the bump
right there across from
the garbage dump
you can find me outback
