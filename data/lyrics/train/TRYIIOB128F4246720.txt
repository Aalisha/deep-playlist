The other night when we kissed
You told me I was yours forever
But when I woke up the next morning, you were gone
Come back baby
Come into my arms

You, you showed me how love could be
Just show me how much you need
You've always been by my side
Oh, baby that's no lie
'Cause I, I've always been true to you
I've always loved one, that's true
Oh baby, can't you see that it's you
You know that I love you so

[Chorus: x 2]
Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel
Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real
I've always been too much for you it burns inside
