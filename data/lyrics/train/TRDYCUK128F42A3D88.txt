Well, Mamma was exhausted after she had me
Took two nurses to hold me and one nurse to slap me
Doctor turned to Mamma and he shook his head
Wiped the sweat off his brow and then he said
"This boy's way off the charts as far as I can tell
Ooh, brr, Mamma, he's a double XL"

By the second grade, I was five foot two
Fifth grade, I was wearin' a size 12 shoe
Eighth grade, I was shoppin' at the Big & Tall
And the coaches had me playin' High School football
Uncle Roy said, "Boy, you'll make the NFL
Ooh, brr, son you're a double XL"

Double XL, double XL
Don't call me on the phone, just ring my dinner bell
