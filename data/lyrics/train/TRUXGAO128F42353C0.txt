Smile, she said and if you want
I'll look the other way
Until you regain your melancholy disposition
Or until you get over yourself

You're such a European S-O-B
Could you exist without your irony?
I guess that you're afraid to alone or be alive
Or be a boy without a girl

Monday morning, feeling alright
What's wrong with this picture? Nothing at all
Open your eyes, there's nothing but blue skies
