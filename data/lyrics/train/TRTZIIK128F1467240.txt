Sing a song of love
Sing it, then the sun will shine for you
Sing a song of love
It's the song that bring your dreams come true
Play it like you feel
It will never let you down, my friend
Sing a song of love
Yes, it will help you when it comes right from your heart

Sing a song of love
Sing a song of love
