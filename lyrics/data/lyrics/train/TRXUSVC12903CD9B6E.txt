Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine
1992 Love Album
While You Were Out
While you were out
spreading the gospel
According to whatever
you believed in at the time
Her majesty's axemen cameth
and closed the hospital
The birthplace
of out bonny baby Brian

Yesterday they took away
our bus stop
Today they'll try and take
our happy home
Tomorrow I'll be burned
as a witch
...
