3 pm on my feet and staggering
Through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
I got carried away
Sick, Sick of sleeping on the floor
Another night another score
I'm jaded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times- lets face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?
Stella would you take me home?

2 am I'm on a blackout binge again
