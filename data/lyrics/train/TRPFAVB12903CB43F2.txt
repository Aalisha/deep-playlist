Readin' Pimp
Playa-istic shit
By dino boys
Tryin' to get these hoes for every nook & cranny
And make 'em join
The winning team
Ain't nothin' but realness
I know they feel this
Ain't nothin' but sponges
Waitin' for me to leak or slip & spill this
Game I got at an early age by watchin' all the G's
Rat heads get nothin' but cheese
And drop down on they knees wit ease
I make 'em blow me
Then I tell that ho to blow my homie
Ho, don't ya know me?
When you say you love me, I make you show me
If you ain't never sucked no dick, you best recognize
Don't be surprised when you see my nut
Splashin' between your eyes
Don't even know these hoes
They come up out they clothes for me
Feelin' like a camera man on spikes
When they pose for me
I watch 'em rise
Slappin' that ass like they was in the Kentucky... Derby
Bouncin' on my dick
'cause these hoes love to f**k me
I don't get sprung
I keep 'em trippin' on this game I give 'em
They dirty mack me
But ain't f**kin' wit my playerizm

Playerizm
Playerizm
Shootin' nothin' but that playerizm
Playerizm
Niggas hate me for my playerizm
Playerizm
All I give them is that playerizm
Playerizm

Playerizm
Playerizm
Shootin' nothin' but that playerizm
Playerizm
Bitches love me for my playerizm
Playerizm
All I give them is that playerizm
Playerizm
