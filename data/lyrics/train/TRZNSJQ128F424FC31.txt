Sorry for the pain you're in
All the lacked up people that clipped your wings
I'm sorry for the feelings that left you twisted

Sorry for the love you lost
Thought you spent it on things that never returned
I'm sorry

Sorry that you wouldn't believe
All the love from your friends that you couldn't recieve
I'm sorry your miracle girl is rested

Sorry that the light burned out
You tried to hold on for the fear of the doubt
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
