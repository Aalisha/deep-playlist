You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you'd be like heaven to touch
oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you
Oh, in the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
the thought of you leaves me weak
there're no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
oh, did let me know that it's real
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
and if it's quite all right
I need you baby
to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby
don't bring me down, I pray
oh, pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
let me love you
You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you'd be like heaven to touch
oh, I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
and if it's quite all right
I need you baby
to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby
don't bring me down, I pray
