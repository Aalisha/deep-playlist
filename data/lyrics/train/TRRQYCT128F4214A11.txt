(50 Cent)

Yeah, G-Unit, Haha.

I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
Girl you look like someone that I done fucked before
I've been around the world
I've met all kinds of girls
Girl you look like someone I done fucked on tour (Uh huh)
(Getting paper things change) I'm rich bitch
(You done heard of my name) 50 Cent bitch
(I'm a P.I.M.P.) I'm a pimp bitch
(You done heard of me) Cause I'm the shit
? At first they didn't want they want me
See a nigga gettin' paid they want push 'n pull me
You see these ho's chasin' a nigga
I have them in the hotel chasin a nigga
50 like a lolipop lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady
Oh!

(Chorus)

Groupie love,
Gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
Gimme gimme gimme that groupie love
When you see me in V.I.P.
When ho's around me
Man they give me that groupie love
Come gimmie gimmie gimmie that groupie love
Come gimmie gimmie gimmie that groupie love
Tonight you wanna fuck wit me
It's alright wit me
