Life could be a dream, life could be a dream
Do do do do, sh-boom

Life could be a dream (Sh-boom)
If I could take you up in paradise up above (Sh-boom)
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart
(Hello, hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom-a-boom)

Day dong da ding-dong
Sha-lang-da-lang-da-lang
Ah, whoa whoa zip
Ah bo da do da dip, whoa

Life could be a dream (Sh-boom)
If only all my precious plans would come true (Sh-boom)
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
Life could be a dream, sweetheart
(Do do do do, sh-boom)
