You said, to put on a happy face on a high school stage
But I read what you really meant, your handwriting on a Bible page
You waited like you told me though we knew it right away
It took eight and a half more years to finally say

I fell in love with you
And that love became something new
It keeps getting stronger than we ever could have longed
Love keeps growing more love

When we got the news, we had to call our families
And start painting the room a nice, bright blue
Our vows, they started breathing and they took on flesh and blood
And we held them in our arms and tasted God was good
