There's something I must say
There's something I must do
I planned it all this way
Designed it just for you
Do you wanna be with me
be with me at all
Do you have to be so cool
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew

Chorus
I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough
