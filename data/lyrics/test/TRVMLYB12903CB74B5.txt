My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go... and if I know
When I finally get there
Taking off my glasses

Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine...

Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something

Hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey

People keeping score
So ya better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else
Got your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in my own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine...

Busy holding on
...
