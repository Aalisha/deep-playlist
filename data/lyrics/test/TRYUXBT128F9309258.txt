So you made a u-turn at the roundabout 
You didn't even look behind 
Is there something we need to talk about? 
Tell me why you changed your mind?

And I don't know what I said
But it stuck in your head
And now I guess you're seeing red
ha, ha, ha

Now we're drivin' on a different road 
Tell me where you wanna go
