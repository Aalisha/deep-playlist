This much delight, fills columns to new heights
All these things about me you never can tell
Colors run prime, paint a picture so bright
All these things about me you never can tell
You make me sleep so badly invisible friend

Turn the dial on my words
I can feel they fall short
Turn the dial, chime alarm, chime alarm
...
