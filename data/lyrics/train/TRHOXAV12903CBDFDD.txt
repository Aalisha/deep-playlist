One day, the last day, it was beauty to hold,
Take back, I would take back, I would claw back,
What they stole

Hold on just a little bit longer,
Just hold on just a little bit longer,
I hold you, when you’re dead in the water,
I hold you, when you’re dead in the water.

Cry out, just you cry out,
Will they answer, your call,
Sense of, make some sense of,
Just don’t try me, at all
...
