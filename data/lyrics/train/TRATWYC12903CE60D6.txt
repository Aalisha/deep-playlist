I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
My beating pulse crawls to a strange height
Please calm it down

I need a strong pull from your little lies
Or I'm going down
'Cause I built it all up from the inside
And you burned it down

'Cause when you took your love away
You let go

I feel the world fall from the inside
It's coming down
...
