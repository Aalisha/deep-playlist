People... trying to tear us apart
Trying to rip out my heart
People talkin'
People talkin'

Livin' is full of misery and pain
Somebody called you a dirty name
Keep on walkin'
Keep on walkin'

I love you more than this cruel world will ever know
I wanna be your girl forever
I don't wanna let you go
If I could change things
I would die and return
Another name and
Knowin' everything I've learned
...
