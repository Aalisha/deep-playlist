High above the clouds
Bring on the trolley
Release three loons
For a screw-top red
And as we watch the Earth diminsh
Will it linger on the finish?
Rest's assured when the bottle's dead

We'll leave a jet-trail across the sky
Just like Armstrong and the guys
Vapour trail against the blue
I'd get off on getting higher
Is it over the Moon for the frequent flyer?
