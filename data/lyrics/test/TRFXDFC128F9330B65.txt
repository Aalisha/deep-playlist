Hey everybody, it's good to be here at the Crusty Canteena
We've got a real special show for you'll tonight
Featuring my new best pal, this guy
He is an idiot

So what are we going to sing about, SpongeBob?
We are going to sing a song about friends
What kind of friends, SpongeBob?
Well, listen up and I'll tell you

Who's there for you when you are sad and down?
Idiot friends
