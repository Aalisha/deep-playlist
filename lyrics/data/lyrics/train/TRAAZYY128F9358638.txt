It's gettin kinda heavy!

Yeah yeah
It's gettin kinda heavy!

Verse 1:
See I was raised,
In a good home with morals and all.
Got my degree.
Made momma proud and worked real hard.
Bet she never though't I'd end up w/ a guy like you.
Thugged out, hood grill, hustles w/ a caddy,
big dreams, dirty south nothin like my daddy.

hook:
But I---------- love this man
and I can't stop(Uh oh)
He's like a force of nature
nature
excuse me but I love his dirty drawers
and ------I'm in love with a thug
and proud of it
He's like a force of nature
and nothing you can say can keep me from him. (Him)
