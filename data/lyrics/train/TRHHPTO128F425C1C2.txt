From the faults in you to the ruin of we
From the eyes to the hands to the nothing
Nothing desperately we

From the front lines can it be seen
We adoring every move you make
Subtle things lost to life

Beyond the competing, we are the strangers
Falling ever forward through the web of you
Subtle lies lost on life
