And everything will come to pass.
And it all happened in the dash
I saw the numbers on each side
But all that mattered was the line

When you left so many came
To see the stone they had engraved
It all happened way too fast
It all happened in the dash

And everything will come and go
And we will never really know
Just how much falls in-between
Or we'd say everything will be.

But we can't sum up every page
With just one cover and one name
It all happened way too fast
And all we had becomes a dash
