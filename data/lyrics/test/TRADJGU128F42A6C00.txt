Killa! Jones! Freaky! Santana! Come on!

Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake

Yo, who wanna mess with me, or come mess with me
Be a mess to clean, call me Mr. Clean
Way I glitz and gleam, trigger team
Click the Beam, hit the fiend get on me, lookin' like I'm nicotine

But it's all for the green like Listerine
Had to diss the queen, thinkin' I'm gon' get her jeans
I ain't Ginuwine, ma, my mission's mean
All my nigga team, fix the fix, get the cream

I sit in Bahamas with Alyssa Milano
Got the Crist' and the ghanga and it's gettin' un-karma
Comma, now she cryin', she missin' her mama
Just a steppin' stone for me now, I'm hittin' Madonna
And she twistin' the fauna as we sit in the sauna
Guess it's just my persona, got her kissin' my condom

We're the Dip, so cut shit
Ma, twist your hips and lick your lips
We're the Dip, so cut shit
Ma, twist your hips and lick your lips, c'mon

Ma, you straight frontin', let's get the date jumpin'
See your booty panties, ma, shake something
