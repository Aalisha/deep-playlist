See a dog upon the road
Running hard to catch a cat
Car is pulling to a halt
Truck behind me doesn't know
Everything is in the balance
Of a moment I can't control
And you're sympathetic strings
Are like the stirrings in my soul

I could go at anytime
There's nothing safe about this life
I could go at anytime

Find the meaning of the act
Remember how it goes
Every time you take to water
You swim against the flow
