Sad night, the weeper of starwind sky
Take me where the shimmering lights are fading out
Through the shadows of hate
And through the fires of grace
I followed the voice in the night
Beautiful as black sky
But nothing I found

My thoughts are captured by the magical chants
Of the spirits, but I cannot see them with these dead eyes
Lost I am in these dismal streams
Lost I am forever in my life

The snow is falling on the withering leaves
I am left in the cold
The shadows are crying in the moonlight
Is this night the last of my life
