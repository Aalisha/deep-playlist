I'm getting ready for the function at the junction
And baby you'd better come on right now
Because everybody's gonna be there
We got people comin' from everywhere

We got Ling Ting Tong from China
Long Tall Sally from Carolina
We got 007, the private eye,
And he's bringin' all the guys from "I Spy"

Come one, come all, we gonna have a ball
down at the function at the junction
And baby you'd better come on right now

We serving egg foo yung and barbecue
...
