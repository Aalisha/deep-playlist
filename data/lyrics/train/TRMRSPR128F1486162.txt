Who said that money was everything
Well that's a crock, you know what I'm saying
When the well runs dry
Say goodbye to fair weather friends
If I need a hug
And feel like crawling under a rug
If I fell on my face
I know that you'd be there to help me up

Cause it's you, only you that makes me strong
Cause there ain't nobody, no
Gonna make me live my life alone
A friend won't leave me lying in the road
While the others they just pelt me with their sticks and stones
...
