Umm-hmm
Now, there's a new dance
It goes like-a this low
I know what you're thinkin', babe
Child, it ain't The Jerk, n-no

Now, if ya come here to swim
Now man, you're out a-luck
The name of this dance
Child, they call, The Duck

Hey Lord, you run down to the river, Lord
(Come on baby)
Then you get a duck
(Try your luck)

Oh Lord, you start to flap your wings
(Come on baby)
Child, until you get enough
(Do The Duck)

Now, come on, baby
(Come on baby)
Come on, baby
(Come on baby)
