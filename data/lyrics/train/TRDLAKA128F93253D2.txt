Walk the hidden ways of mysterious, iniquity lands.
Paved with roads of thorns.
Light has diminished to none.
A world of total splendor,
Ravenous for devotion.
Where all gods possess the thrones.
Worshipped by those with no will.

With no emotion, they kill dissimilarity
Indisputable allegiance to wicked ways.
Overthrown all their teachings.
The abrupt failure of now impaled beings.
Their temples burn in blazing fire.
