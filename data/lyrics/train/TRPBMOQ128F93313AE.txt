back 2 the basics yeah(repeating Fading in to the track)

(Ginuwine)
no one can ever take my place,
im coming back to make this claim,
i talk it cos i tote big things,
and never will i fall off

i work like im broke as hell,
but still got tucked away 8 mil,
could quit if i wanna right now,
but i wont cos i love it, yes i love it.
