You said I’m always saying sorry for the same old things
I’m sorry for the drugs and how much I drink
You said I say it so much it doesn’t mean anything
I’m sorry my love, but I had to leave

I hope most of you will never know
What it’s like to let it a love go
Leaving everything at home
Everything you’ve ever known

I can’t fix this from a phone
I’m sorry you feel so alone
It’s like I told you,
You’re better off without me, I’m sick of saying sorry
So far from home

You keep calling and complaining that I just don’t care
