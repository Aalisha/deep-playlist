Oh no one will forgive me,
The psycho system doesn't want me,
What am I supposed to do?
I'll be a lower than low dosser.

I know I miss it and I bought it,
No b-l-ow I could have snorted,
I didn't mean to blow my cover,
But either way, there was no other,
Oh yeah!
What they gunna say?

[Chorus]
Oh what have you done?
You dirty Rock 'n' Roller,
Oh what have you done?
You dirty Rock 'n' Roll

The papers give me disappointment,
I'm a celebrity appointment,
I've got no butter for my toast,
...
