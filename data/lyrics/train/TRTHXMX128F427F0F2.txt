Ask a lot of questions, people are so scared,
Given all the reasons we don't care to hear,
Around the whole wide world, it's happening every day,
Hide in the places, y'all know where they are,
To beat the heat of the city, her clothes were all white,
In a courtyard of concrete, my uptempo prize,
Yeah say, what you got, it's already gone,
Yeah say, what you got, it's already gone,

I step a little closer, i whisper in her ear,
I speak with conviction, this is a lesson in fear,
Fear for tomorrow, tomorrow's come today,
And with the drag of addiction,
See this is how we were raised.
