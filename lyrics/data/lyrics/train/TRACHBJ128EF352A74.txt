The wind in the willows plays tricks
On all the boys out for there kicks
Looking for numbness and chicks
In other words in search of the infinite fix
I got my hands in my pockets
Looking for a change
Like I'm looking for a room in my house to rearrange
From the flip flop top
To the cozy little bottom
She's got my hands locked
No way to stop 'em
Baby down the bar
You know she's looking wild
Floors me cold
...
