Another boring day is close to the end
We share the last glass of wine
Much too tired to move, head on my hands
Avoid to look into your eyes

Let's watch a movie, watch a comedy
Watch pornography
Fast food for our minds
The rich man's far too fat
I don't like his grin
But all the women try to mate with him
