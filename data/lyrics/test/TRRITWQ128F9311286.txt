My soul starts spinning again
I can't stop feeling
No, I won't stop feeling
And the fun's not fun anymore
I can't stop feeling
No, I won't stop feeling

You leave me here on my own
You leave me here on the floor
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel it
You can't feel anymore

Feel anymore
Feel anymore
Feel anymore
