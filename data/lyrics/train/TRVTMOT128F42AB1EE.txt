Woah
Yeah, Yeah

Woah
Yeah, Yeah

I wonder if you're going down
Well, we all know you get lost
And then get found
And then I wonder so

I cant believe that's what you said
I wonder in my sleep
I can't believe that's what you heard
Can you not defeat

I can't take this
No, I don't like it
I don't know where you are

You know she's dancing at the disco
Woah, She's dying on the floor
