Too late to leave, blinded by the last night
Too far, too late, too deep
To escape from the hands of this night
Winter has our hearts, it finally tore us apart

The cries of loss, ripping wings
We are frozen on the lake
So close to watch her die
But too far to leave together
This tomb of ice finally ripped us apart
...
