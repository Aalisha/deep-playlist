Close your eyes
It's easier that way...
A golden cup
And a toast to kings
Lost and decayed, we are cut beyond our saving
But we are home now, the room is still warm.

I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
Bless these shadows and tested every one
They can't steal our love tonight.
