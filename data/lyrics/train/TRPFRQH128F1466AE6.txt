How many times have you heard, how many times did you say
"i think I'm going crazy! you're driving me out of my mind!"?
We know it's just an expression, a silly little phrase.
Not the doorbell, not a bird call .
Koo koo.

How do you drive someone crazy?
To where?
In what kind of car?
Maybe we find a road map.
I'm sure it's not very far.
