If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

I don't admit it
I play it cool
But every minute
That I'm with you

I feel the fever and I won't lie
I break a sweat
My body's telling
All the secrets I ain't told you yet

Oh oh
I struggle to contain
Whoa oh
The love that's in my veins
Oh oh
And how it circulates
Oh oh

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
