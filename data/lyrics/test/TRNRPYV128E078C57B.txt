No motorcycles,
no Jap cars,
no waterbed sales,
no dirty movies,
no man strippers
turns on her lights

She only plays with the big boys
She don't care about you
Cheerleaders, another dealers
she's doing them all

She's not a good deal

In elevators, in strange places
she only likes to play
But only one, a good as place
makes her so wild

It really makes her bloom
It really makes her bloom
