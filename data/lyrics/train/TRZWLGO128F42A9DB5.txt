Wake in the morning, feeling low
I don't sleep at night
Oh you've broken my heart
Here in the dark moonlight

I see a rainbow, I don't know where it goes
Going to follow my dreams
Oh someday baby
There gonna shine for me

I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
Yes I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand

I know the story, I know how it goes
