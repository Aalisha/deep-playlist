When the sun sets above
And there's nowhere to hide
Her refuge, the dark black sea
She hails only one
It's the dead of the damned
Her moan whales, through sea to sea
Her eyes glow a light

Her lust that is sweet to kill

In through the night
Your day slips away
Casting two shadows
When she is after you

In the black of the night
Her mist roles in
