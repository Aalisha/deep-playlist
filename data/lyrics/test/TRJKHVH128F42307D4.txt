1, 2, 3
I drive you crazy, shaking my money maker
You lookin' at me all the way over there
Don't be shy, baby, just come on over here
Keep it up, don't quit and maybe you can get it

So tripping all over my body
Tell me, don't I look exotic?
I know you wanna get me
First let me take a selfie
Oh, I'm hotter than a toaster
Me and my home girls close up
I see was I never it's down
You ain't never seen none of that fun
