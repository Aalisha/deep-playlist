Jack you've spreading round for so long, now I'm so tired
The only thing you can go and do is get yourself fired
And with your pay cheque, just like the last one
When tonight's through it will be gone and so will I

This is been a long life, now mine is nearly through
I've had a lot of time to think now I must speak to you
Tell me am I dreaming as I look around
We can't afford a descent life for those with their feet on the ground

I feel it my duty to try and pass it on
This wisdom I've acquired.
I understand the nature of life
