Beg
(Lady's and gentlemen put your hands together)

Gotta you gotta
Gotta you gotta
Gotta you gotta
(Lady's and gentlemen put your hands together)
Beg beg

Used to tell me you where my best friend
Used to tell me that your loyalty
Would never end
Say you'd always have my back
As soon as I hit rock bottom
You were no-where to be had (no no)

Don't not give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If your searchin forgivness
Don't not give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If your searchin forgivness

Gotta you gotta
Gotta you gotta
(Today's letter was B and the word was beg)
Gotta you gotta
(Beg beg)
