Gather up in the arms of your pity
the sick, the depraved, the desperate, the tired
all the scum of out weary city
gather up in the arms of your love
those who expect no love from above

I ask you this, which way to turn
I ask youthis, which sin to bear
which crown to put upon my hair
I do not know, I do not know
...
