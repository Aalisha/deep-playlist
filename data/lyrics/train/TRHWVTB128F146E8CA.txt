Two sides twist and then collide;

I'm coming through. (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission,
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in.

All the cards begin to stack up,
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime,
But it's you I can't deny.
(You I can't deny.)

Dull heat rises from the sheets.
I'm both a patient boy,
Well, and a jealous man. (Am I coming?)
But double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven,
