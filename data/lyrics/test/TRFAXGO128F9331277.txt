Tell me do u wanna
go home with me
Tell me do u wanna
go creep with me
Tell me do u wanna
get wild with me
Tell me do u wanna
go home

Tell me do u wanna
go home with me
Tell me do u wanna
go creep with me
Tell me do u wanna
get wild with me
Tell me do u wanna
go home

The dance floor is jumping
the music is pumping
I'm checkin out your groove
bout' to make my move
across this crowded room
cuz I'm scoping you (baby)
I'm feeling confident
Just came from the bar
Sick of wondering
Who the hell you are
Cuz I'm wanting you
What a nigga gotta do?

Tell me do u wanna
go home with me
Tell me do u wanna
