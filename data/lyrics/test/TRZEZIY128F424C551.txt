Warning sound of sirens, waking you up
This 5-piece mayhem crew will force you to stop
Striking with power, no hesitation
We'll turn your head in less than an hour
Welcome to our nation

We will ease your pain
We'll ignite the flames

Underestimated, head to toe in dirt
Keep your distance for your own sake, try to stay alert
Despite what you think, despite what you say
You better take a tighter grip because we are here to stay

We will ease your pain
We'll ignite the flames
