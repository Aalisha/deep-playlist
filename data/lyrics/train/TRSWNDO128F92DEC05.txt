Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrilling in spite of the chilling weather

Sleigh bells ring are you listening in the lane snow is glistening
It's beautiful sight we're happy tonight walking in the winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird here to stay is a newbird
He sings a love song as we go alone walking in the winter wonderland
