You know what, I'mma make it do what it do baby
I'mma make it do what it do baby

Now baby I just wanna take your freakin' clothes off
Kiss your body while I take your freakin' clothes off
Leave them heels on while I take your clothes off
Leave them lights on, let me see you go off

Ooh, baby that's my body callin' your name
Ooh, and baby that's your body doin' the same
So act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me
Act right, don't show me, back it up, now put it on me

Now what you wanna do, you wanna get high, you wanna get fired up
What you wanna do, you wanna get sexed, you wanna get tied up
Get your rodeo wired up, baby girl lift them thighs up
I think you betta wise up 'cause I'm about to rise up

Now what you wanna do, you wanna get high, you wanna get fired up
What you wanna do, you wanna get sexed, you wanna get tied up
Get your rodeo wired up, baby girl lift them thighs up
I think you betta wise up 'cause I'm about to rise up
