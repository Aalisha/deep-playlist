HOME! To my destiny dear
HOME! I can rest without fear
HOME! For the soul who has found he is half not whole!
HOME! Place where I find relaxion
HOME! For some natural action
HOME! From the cold an the glitter and that is not gold!

At Home by the fire
You only desire to Go out and get in a stew
Could get you in trouble
Get home on the double
You're dreaming! You dream can come true
where you knew it would right from the start
