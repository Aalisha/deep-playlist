Lucille, you know how I feel
Put me behind that wheel
Lucille, you know how I feel
Put me behind that wheel

'Cause every waking day's just the same damn thing
I get up and go to work and then I sleep again
It's just my days and oh they never change
I was I could just run away

Lucille, you know how I feel
Put me behind that wheel
Lucille, you know how I feel
Put me behind that wheel
