(Marc Byrd/Steve Hindalong)

Lord of Heaven and Earth
(Lord of Heaven and Earth)

Lord of all creation
Of the water, earth and sky
The Heavens are Your Tabernacle
Glory yo the Lord on high

God of wonders
Beyond our galaxy
You are holy, holy
The universe
Declares Your majesty
You are holy, holy

Early in the morning
