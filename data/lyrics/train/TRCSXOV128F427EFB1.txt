You belong to the gang and you say you can't break away
But I'm here with my hands on my heart
And our families can't agree, I'm your brother's sworn enemy
But I'll shout out my love to the stars
So wait for the stone on your window, your window
Wait by the car and we'll go, we'll go
When first we laid eyes, I swore to no compromise
'Til I felt my caress on your skin
Well, how soon we were betrayed, your sister gave us away
And your father came all unhinged
