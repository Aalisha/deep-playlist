It was a rainy night
The night the king went down
Everybody was crying it seemed
Like sadness had surrounded the town
Me, I went to the liquor store
And I bought a bottle of wine and a bottle of gin
I played his records all night
Drinking with a close, close friend
Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all
But even in the darkest of night
You can always hear the king's call
You can always hear the king's call
Well, they put him away in Memphis
Six feet beneath the clay
Everybody was crying
