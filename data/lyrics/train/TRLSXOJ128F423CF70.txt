I'm the type of girl who likes to kick a ball around
The park
And sometimes likes to escape with my friends from
London in the dark
It's silly that you get upset by these things that I do
You have to accept that this is me and this is who I
Love to be
I'll never change for anyone especially not, especially
Not you

You don't have to be intimidated by me
I swear I won't bite I'll play with you nicely
I'm so full of all your stupid insecurity
So if you can't take me for all that I am
