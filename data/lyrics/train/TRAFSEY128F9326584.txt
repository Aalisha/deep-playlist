I got no money--I got no faith
I got no interest in the human race,-- But I don't mind
I got no credit--I got no sense
I got no advocate for my defence--But I don't mind
Life is easy--but the price is high
And there's so many things that I can't buy
--But I don't need to know the reasons why
I'm throwing stones at the wind
Pull the string, make him sing,
He'll do anything that you want him to,
They tell him he's free,
Between you and me,
He's throwing stones at the wind
...
