It could've been me
But it was you
Who went and bit off
A little bit more
Than he could chew

You said that you had it made
but you been had
The woman no good, no how
Thinkin' maybe the blood is bad

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe
