When you're tryin' to make your livin' makin' rain
You got to put on a real good show, tell the people anything
You got to get the Lord's attention any old way you can
Maybe He'll show a little mercy and start cryin' for the lined

Rainmaker, rainmaker the land is parched and dry
(It's a rainmaker)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the rain fall from the sky
(I'm a-talkin' 'bout)
Rainmaker, rainmaker the crops are gonna die
(Now listen to me now)
Rainmaker, rainmaker make the Heaven's cry

Well, some say I work miracles, some say I'm just insane
Many a time I bet my life that I could make it rain
One time I had a whole town beatin' the drums
And singin' through the night
We watched the morning sun come up and not a raincloud in sight
