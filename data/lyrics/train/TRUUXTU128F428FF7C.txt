would you believe in any word I say
I wouldn't mind but somehow I got
lost along my way
the borders you seek are what I left behind
all I can see is just an
apparition to the blind

you may not know me
but I keep your hand in mine
for what you show me
and sometime
you may find

why I'm here
and there's nothing I can give
but the simple fact I live
why I'm here
if I cast the days away
...
