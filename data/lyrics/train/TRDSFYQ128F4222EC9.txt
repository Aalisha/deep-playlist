Black Uhuru,
Natural Reggae Beat Lyrics

You better be ready to
Catch the reggae train
You better catch the fever, to
Make you move and groove
It's not the punky honky
It's a natural reggae root
To make you keen tight
Keen tight.

Cause you know
The tribute right
Oh Lord lead and guide
I & I in the earth
Cause they try many times
...
