Fashion fascists out in droves,
Some with powder up their nose ...
And the money men who had to steal away.
Telling stories who they've had.
Who's a no count, who looks bad.
Then they turn around and say how much they like you ...
Like you ... Like you? No.

I love to hate you... I love to hate you ... I really do.

Playing games with people lives
...
