Just let me walk
This road of life with you
Step by step, uphill or down
No matter where it's leading to

Reach out and take my hand
If you should find a hill along the way too steep to climb
(Lean on me) Lean on me
I'll never let you fall
(Lean on me) Lean on me
I'll keep you standing tall

Oh, somehow together we'll make it
Please let me dream

The dreams that you're dreamin' of
...
