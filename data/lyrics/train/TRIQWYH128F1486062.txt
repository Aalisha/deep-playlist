Lease could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's this? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's this? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's this? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's this? (I may be paranoid, but no android)

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
