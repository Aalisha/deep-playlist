Put your body in it
Put your body in it
Put your body in it
Put your body in it

Put your body in it
Put your body in it
Put your body in it

It's a shame
You waited all night long to dance
Who's to blame
When I'm givin' you another chance

This is it
Get on up and be yourself {Free yourself}
Only you've got the key
There's no one else

Don't be afraid, no
I'm waiting just for you
And if it takes you all night long
I'll see you through

Put your body in it {Dancin'}
Keep on dancin'
You can do it
Non-stop now
{Move your body}

Watchin' you
I know you can get to it
? Cause when it's hot
Ooh, there's nothin' to it

Give it up
Dancin' is the only way {Only way}
Don't let it stop
Feelin' better every day
...
