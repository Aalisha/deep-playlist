While some sore heads will rue last nights endeavours
And make Sundays vow that they won't get so leathered
Dads shout at lads so they foul number 7
There's no need for fighting they're only 11
A little introduction to the state of things

What of the woman who stands by her fella
Despite the bruises brought on by the stella
To cook and to clothe and to clean and to screw
Is not the sum total of all she can do

They claim that the threats high, oh do me a favour
Control you by fear so you don't know your neighbour
