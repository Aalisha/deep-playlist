And I awoke in utter horror from the noxious dream
Was it, in fact, a dream?
The vision, the smell, the screams
I can't hear my voice
I can't see myself
Vague emptiness
There is no sound, no sense of touch
Non existence

This room is empty, and all I see is white
No exit... nothing in sight

The jaws of insanity begin to drip
In this labyrinth of non-existence
