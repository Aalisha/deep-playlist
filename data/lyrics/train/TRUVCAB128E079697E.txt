(Tony Yayo)
Yeah, yeah (c'mon!)
These rich sluts love me like I'm Morris Chestnutt
They hit me on the 2-way, beggin to link up
My wrist is blinged up, canary and blue
For them project chicks, that be actin new
I got 3 trucks, 2 Coupes, all in a month
Blowin hundreds in Northern Light, stuffin the blunt
Catch a stunt in the drop Lambo
My P.O. think he Rambo, but I'm still holdin on that ammo
Everybody rat now, spittin on the beat tapes
Dirtball niggaz, can't even pee straight
My mansion shit, moved in the West wing
You broke-ass niggaz couldn't buy a chicken wing
Stop it money, I'm out for the profit money
And that advance that you got, be my pocket money
Yeah my transporter's cute but got a real flat chest
Put a brick in her bra she a 36 F

(Chorus: Tony Yayo)
You got diesel on your strip, that's that G shit
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-U-nit
You got your bitch movin bricks, that's that G shit
