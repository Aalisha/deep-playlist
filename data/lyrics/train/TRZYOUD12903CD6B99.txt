(Cenicero, cenicero)
(Mi coraz贸n de cenicero)
(Cenicero, cenicero)
(Mi coraz贸n de cenicero)

You are the birth and you are waste
You are the one who took my place

A leap of faith I could not take

A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make
A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make

(Cenicero, cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi coraz贸n de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Cenicero, cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi coraz贸n de cenicero)
