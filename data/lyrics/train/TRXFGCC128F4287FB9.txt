Take another chance on love
We've all been hurt before
And you should take that chance on me
No one could love you more
Just think how we could spend our nights

We could be dancin' in the dark
Dancin' heart to heart
We could be dancin' in the dark
So come, hold me now
We could be dancin' in the dark
Dancin' heart to heart

I might be actin' selfishly
But you won't give your heart to me
And I know all the reasons why
