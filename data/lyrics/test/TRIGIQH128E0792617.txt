Goddamn your righteous hand

I eat innocent meat
The housewife I will beat
The prolife I will kill
What you won't do I will
I bash myself to sleep
What you sow I will reap
I scar myself you see
I wish I wasn't me
I am the little stick
You stir me into shit
I hate therefore I am
Goddamn your righteous hand
Goddamn ooh Lord, Goddamn ooh Lord
Goddamn ooh Lord, Goddamn ooh Lord

Pseudo-morals work real well
