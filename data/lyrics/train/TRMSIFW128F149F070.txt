Cut your heart out.
Count to ten.
Where incision begins, illusion will end.
Dispose love, her crying embrace.
Shatter my hope into pieces.
And I'm left to pick up the pieces.
Every word that you spoke was just poison and I choked.
Everything that we had meant nothing to you.
Kisses burn my lips with sick sadness.
