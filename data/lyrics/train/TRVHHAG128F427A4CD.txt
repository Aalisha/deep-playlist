(Tom Shapiro/Steve Bogard)

I got a headache from the work day
And a heartache from last night
Anything that could've lately did not go right
They say time is the ticket
But I sure ain't got the time
With a little jingle in my pocket
There's a mission on my mind

I've got some pain to kill
Hurt to heal
Anything I have to do I will
So come on baby let's take a ride
Way on over to the other side
Of this low-down, lonely, no good way to feel
I got some pain to kill

Gonna find me a party
