I kissed her lips in a perfumed pavillion
And all the subtleties that we could find
Blowing grace notes through my mind

Oh, but her hand brought such sweet pain
The kiss, yet all powerful, saved face twice
And turned your bad seed to grain
Ripping the roots of my heart again

I held her hand in an unchanging moment
She was feeding me love like she was holding a spoon
But her head was turned by a raging moon
And she would be gone by the next afternoon

Hollywood memories are made from times such as these
But, I wouldn't feel sorry for me if I were you
