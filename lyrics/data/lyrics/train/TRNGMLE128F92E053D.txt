Congo just hear da tune,
Rise inna the palace
inna Ethiopia you there, you know

Well I say woe onto those
who are wise in there own eyes
and yet they prudent in them own sight
Remember say you got,
wolf there inna sheep clothes
Yet things will be alright, oh culture

Living in Rome my people how safe you are
away from your home I say you're oh so far
He has been crowned for fighting so many wars
Black belongs to the throne Melchizedek read the stars
red gold and green honors the earth, fill my heart with joy
You unfold, prince and princess makes your convoy
The land of love filled with righteousness for I and I
keep I safe in your arms Emperor Selassie I

(CHORUS:)
Hail King Selassie, Ethiopia's own devine majesty
Emanuel, holy, holy
Take us home Marcus Garvey
