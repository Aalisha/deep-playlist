Half a week before the winter
The chill bites before it comes
I'm a child of the pleasure
Daddy brings before he runs

He sits behind a desk of mahogany
He whispers dreams into my ear
And though I've givin' him his empire
He delivers me my fear

The unicorns are riding high
Powerful in coats of white
...
