Standing at the terminal I can almost hear the music
Coming from the cold and chilly L.A. night
And when we get to the gate, baby
All of the things that were said
Will they turn you 'round and bring you back
Will they bring you back
Will you come back home 'cause you know I'm waiting

The Light Of Love is always on
You know my love is getting stronger and stronger
The Light Of Love is always on
Keeping the night watch
