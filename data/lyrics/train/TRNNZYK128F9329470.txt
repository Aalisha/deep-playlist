would i lie to jesus
just to breed the consequence
could it be a reason
just a feeling once again
would i seize the minute
that it takes to understand (understand)
understand

guess we're back from scratch now
i don't need a hit again
tell me what's the plan now
is it too much to comprehend
could it be that easy
to catch the plane
catch the plane

would i lie to you
could it be enough to understand
that we're back to reality
you know
