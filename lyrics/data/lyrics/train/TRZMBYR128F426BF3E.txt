He raised his hand and said, "They'll need a place to stand"
And created what we now call the land
He raised his hand and said, "They'll need a place to fly"
And created what we now call the sky
And then He gave life to a man and a woman
 (A man, a woman)
And said, "The rest is in your hands"

So many years have passed since these two people loved
Three billion represents the children of their love
Too many tears have fallen from the eyes of the people
But who decides that

Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
To bring their children back together
Let's give Adam and Eve another chance
