Lovely fingertips on my lips
I don't think I'll get, get, get it
Oh, it's so fun to love someone
Try, try to get, get over it

Your fat cherry lips
Your fat cherry lips
Your fat cherry lips

Lovely fingertips on my lips
I don't think I'll get, get over it
Broken fingertips on your hips
I don't think I'll get, get, get it
