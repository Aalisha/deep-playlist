Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted

She never told me but if she tried
I was a little too young and it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling
It's simply killing and over spilling on me

It goes on and on and on and on and on
It's over spillin' on me
It goes on and on and on and on and on
It goes on and on, y'all

This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace, hope and harmony
