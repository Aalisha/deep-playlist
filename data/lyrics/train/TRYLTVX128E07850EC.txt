Wishin on a shootin star
But dreams alone wont get you far
Can't deny your feelings anymore
The world is waiting right outside your door
What are you waiting for?

C'mon here's your chance
Don't let it slip right through your hands
Are you ready for the ride of your life?
Your dreams are riding on the wind
Just reach out and pull them in
Get ready for the ride of your life
The ride of your life

In your heart
You know what you must do
You only have yourself to answer to
Don't let fear of falling hold you down
