Somewhere tonight a woman cries alone.
Broken vows from the love that has gone wrong.
Her dreams and plans lay shattered on the floor.
Forever ain't that long anymore.

Just down the street he tries to wave goodbye.
His world has been destoyed because her love has died.
He watched as she just walked out the door.
Forever ain't that long anymore.
