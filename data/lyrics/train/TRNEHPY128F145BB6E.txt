Windows in a silent room,
Sunlight burns the walls to black.
Angles and dimensions melt
While colors drip and pillows crack-
Reflections of my memories like pictures pasted on a sheet,
A ribbon film of seperate frames
Lying curled up at my feet.

The film is just a snake-design
And the photographs are fading fast...
These are not memories of mine-
I have no future... no past...

I have seen a thousand afternoons
Dissolve into the night.
Like sugar crystals on a spoon
They disappear from sight.
