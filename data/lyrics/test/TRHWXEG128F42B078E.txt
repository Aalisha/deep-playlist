The signs above my head are clear to all
An underachiever but a true believer
Who never had a hope in hell

I am the soldier
I am the soldier
Who fought a war for nothing
I am the damage that a dream does
I am the damage that a dream does

Sing it out
Sing it out yr not alone
You are not
You are not the only one
You are lost and now yr found
Sing it out
Sing it out

Sing it out
Sing it out yr not alone
You are not
You are not the only one
You are lost and now yr found
Sing it out
