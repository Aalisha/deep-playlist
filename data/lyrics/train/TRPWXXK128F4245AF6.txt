There ain't no tale to the story
'Cause it's all been done before
A finger that leads you
The fate that sees you
And who's to blame for it all, yeah
Flying high on cloud nine
Take me to your star
Won't you join me on the velvet glide
And open up your lovin' arms

'Cause I'm a hellchild
Howlin' at the moon
'Cause I'm a hellchild, hellchild
...
