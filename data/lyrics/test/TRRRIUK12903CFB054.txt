I wish I could believe in something bigger
More than these trees
These winds, these oceans
I wish I could believe what they tell me

I saw, I saw, I saw my brother pack his bags and leave
We made our goodbyes
And now he is settled down in the city
Where he doesn't have to be himself

He used to play an un-tuned guitar
While he sang about me and he sung about the stars
I used to dream about another time
And now it's all clear
...
