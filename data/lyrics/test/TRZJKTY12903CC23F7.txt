And I can't see why you're cryin loud.
Right down the street you're walking proud.
You fiend. You crave.
You're trippin now.
So in the street you're lyin down.
Wasted down on the couch.
Wasted now you're in doubt.
The sun strikes back.
Breathing.
To burn you down.
Melting.
And in your room.
Wasted.
You're in full bloom.
And I told you. . .you're goin down.
You spit a mouthful of lies.
Another spirit dies.
I'm gonna soften you up.
