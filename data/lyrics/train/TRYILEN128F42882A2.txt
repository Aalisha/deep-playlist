(Big Boi)
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggaz
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fuking head
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped cuz them niggaz over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, servin the loyal customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggaz be wanting drinks and shit from the fuking sto', yo
But that's aight, tho', cuz I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
