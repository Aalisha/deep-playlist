Told me this morning, find myself a job
Chicago's Okay, but these times so doggone hard
But you, go ahead Eddie
That's one thing I don't enjoy
She said everything is okay Eddie
You're nothing but a bigtown playboy

Walk the streets all day, come home late at night
Everything I say darling you know it ain't right
