She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
Like a caged up tiger, she's pacing the floor
Oh, the night is young and the moon is full
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
And when she gets like this, I gotta let her go

She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere
She can turn it loose and howl
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door
When she winks at me and smiles
She's in a foot stompin', honky-tonkin'
Love making state of mind
