The man in the back smokes a pack and a half
Sayin "one more time before we go"
The lady in the front wants to roll with the punches
Just one more shot and then she'll know
Everybody's feelin' alright
Runners on an endless flight, so high

One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio

The pretty boys stand just as close as they can
Silhouetting lovers, such a sight
Nobody stares, hey why should they care
...
