The cardboard box that I use to mend my shoes
has shrunk to a couple of square feet
My diet consists of dandelion-roots
Sleeping on a dirt bed with thorn-sheets
Both of my socks are getting kind of stiff
since I ran out of toilet paper
And I don't think that I'd ever change anything even if
I would come to see my state as a failure

My ambition
needs nutrition
for me to do something about it
