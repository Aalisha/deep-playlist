On a Monday
I was arrested
And on a Tuesday,
I got locked up in jail
And on a Wednesday
My trial was attested
And on a Thursday
Nobody would go my bail

Yes I'm gone
Aaaalmost most gone
Yes I'm gone
I'm almost gone
Yes I'm gone,
I'm almost gone
And I ain't going to be seein' them pretty women no more
