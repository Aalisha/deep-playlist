Wild talk - see what I mean
She's the one, she's the mystery queen
Wild talk - that's what she speaks
She's the one, she's the mystery queen

The temperature's rising,
My emotion on scale
It's gettin' higher
Run, baby, get out of your shade!
Was this love an affection, yeah?
It don't mean nothing to me, yeaheaheah
When she starts talking
It's killing ...

Gimme, gimme wild talk - see what I mean
...
