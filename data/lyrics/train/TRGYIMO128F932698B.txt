Pretty girl, pretty girl.
Why do you cry? When you look into the mirror,
tell me what do you see inside? 'Cause you're 
so pretty girl, pretty girl. (What are you crying for?)
Woahhhhh. Pretty girl, open your eyes. If you could see what I'm seeing you would understand why (i call you pretty girl, pretty girl). You aint gotta cry no more.

Whatcha see in your reflection is (not the truth).
Cause girl whatcha thinkin is perfection (your perfection starts 
with you). So, just like you, what can i do? If I'm a pretty girl, wanna be pretty too.
