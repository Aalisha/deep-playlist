He doesn't mean a thing to me
Just another pretty face to see
He's all over town, knockin' 'em down, ahh, honey
And I'd never let him next to me

Well, he's the kind of guy, who thinks he's smart
He's the type that always looks the part
It's all the make, it's all the take, ahh, honey
And I'd never let him touch my heart
