Something for nothing, a bargain, a steal
Used cars on credit card, lost another wheel
I'd like to get it for free
It's what the price should be
I just wanna pay less
I just have to confess
Quality and value, always wanting more
Tip my hat to the taxman, the revenue does poor
You get what you pay for
