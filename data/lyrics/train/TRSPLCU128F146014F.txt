The word is about, there´s something evolving,
whatever may come, the world keeps revolving...
They say the next big thing is here,
that the revolution´s near,
But to me it seems quite clear
thats it´s all just a little bit of history repeating.

The newspapers shout a new style is growing,
but it don´t know if it´s coming or going,
there is fashion, there is fad
...
