ou've got a taste for me and now it seems
I'd better give ___ from your dreams,
Of possession and of control and it's
Set to build up because you want my soul
You're a cannibal, got me in your sights.
When I think you're full, there's your appetite
You're a cannibal, always so needy,
Everything's a battle with you what's it gonna be
You're a cannibal, got me in your sights.
When I think you're full, there's your appetite
Your a cannibal, ever more you crave,
Depends on what you eat baby, master to a slave
