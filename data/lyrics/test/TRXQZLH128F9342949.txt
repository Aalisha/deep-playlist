He wears his hat o'er his eyes
And he's trying to keep it on
Says he's sick of living his life
And he's tired of being alone

No one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine

Got a new sleeping bag
Got no place to sleep it at
Left my dog on the ranch
