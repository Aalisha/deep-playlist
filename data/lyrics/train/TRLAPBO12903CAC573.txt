Starlight shimmers everywhere
There's a certain something in the air
Can you feel what I feel in me?
It's in the air, electricity oh, oh

Glimmering under neon lights
I can see the look, that's in your eyes
Like a shooting star in a galaxy
Making it's way to the heart of me

I'm the one
Love me, love me, love me, love me
My pulse is racing and I'm feeling high
Never-ending starts tonight
When you do what you do to me
Come on and let yourself feel the need in me, oh oh
