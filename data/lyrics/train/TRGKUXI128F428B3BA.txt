I've had my share of disappointments
I've been struck by love
I've been stuck for love
And I've been blind for love
And wasted time for love

I've always lived by my Momma's words so
Never been a fool for love
Tell you like my Momma told me
Remember that you're royalty
And it takes a real man to see

Love is fulltime
Over time
All the time
Now see if he ain't man enough to see
Then you gotta roll
Gotta go
Gotta leave

Love is fulltime
Over time
All the time
Now see if he ain't man enough to see
Then you gotta roll
Gotta go
Gotta leave

Tell me, what good is candy, cards and roses
If only he'll hurt you again?
Just to say that he's sorry again
In my opinion he's the sorriest man
And you can do much better than him
Don't be afraid
To open up your eyes recognize and see
