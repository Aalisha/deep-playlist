Oh looky here I am burning again
Thought it was real but your love it was only pretend
Oh looky here I am walking away
I turn around if you beg
If you beg me to stay
This time I don't think so
I had enough of your romance reflow
Heart breaker with an ego
You were doing some things that could've been illegal
Make sense out of nothing at all
You were pretty much evil
But I've got more to say
No I never, never met nobody, body like you
That ain't no compliment, that's the truth
You're nothing but a cold heart covered in gold
That's why, that's why I'm leaving you
