Wont let ya rain on my parade
No I wont let ya rain on my parade

Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
This is my parade

You hear the beat beat beatin' of the drum
Yea I hear em coming down the street lookin' at me sayin' (oh)
The main attraction if your lookin' for some action better follow me
We Headed to the after party

But if the rain falls down
I'll keep on walkin' you can keep on talkin'
Talkin' up the storm now
I will stay strong got my marchin' boots on
Moving to the song all damn night long

I'm young and I'm having fun so im gunna celebrate
If you wanna play then follow my way but if you dont then get out of my way

Wont let ya rain on my parade
No I wont let ya rain on my parade

I'm gunna take it one step out of town
Dont get out of line
I'm keepin it going just so you know
