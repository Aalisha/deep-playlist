Ain't no love, ain't no love, like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, set off in my bones
Ain't no lonely days, ain't no lonely lonely lonely nights
Every little thing that she does
I know the girl's alright

'Cause I ain't never, never, found me a girl
Love me like you do, to love me like you do
