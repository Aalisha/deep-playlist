Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the dark
My love will follow you
My love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you
Oh my love will follow you

My love will follow you
Down every highway of your soul
You can leave me far behind
My love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go

So close the door
