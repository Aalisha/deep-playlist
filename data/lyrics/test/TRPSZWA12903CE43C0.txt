At our parties, there's two guys for every girl
At our parties, there's two bodies for every cannibal
At our parties, there's two cooks for every entree

Whatever you want, you got, you got

Just don't ask me to wait around 'cause I will
And nobody ever makes up their mind
And it's that which makes me wonder what crazy really is
'Cause everyone seems to be just a little bit

Some more than others
And at our parties, we use sign language
Sign language, sign language
God, come on

We all stop for pedestrians
But as I stand here
Feeling all the braille of your back
I realize I may never have to see again

Because you can lead me anywhere
Anywhere you want
