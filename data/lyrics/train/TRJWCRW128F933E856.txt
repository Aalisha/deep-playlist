That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I

Damn, I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh yeah

But my knees get weak, intensive

When you give me k-kisses

When I'm your lover and your mistress

When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

That's M O N E Y, so sexy, I

Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yeah
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
