Bottle of wine and an old 45
Rifle in the corner that her grandfather left her when he died
Said no surprise, I've had to use it quite a few times
So Jay, don't you ever let us down, don't you ever
I'll have to shoot you and no one will hear a sound

Bruised and bloody, I'm lying on the ground
And I am aware that I let the poor girl down
Now I'm dying as a message to the town
This what happens if you fuck around

And meddle if you want trouble
Trouble, then you should meddle
But don't ever meddle with Emily's heart

She said, get your coat, come on
To the dog track with the money right
Yeah, we had some fun, left with more 'cause we won
I was under investigation on suspicion of doing her wrong
