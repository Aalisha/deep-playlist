Razors edge outlines the dead, incisions in my head.
Anticipation, the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you DIE

Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane!

Innate seed
