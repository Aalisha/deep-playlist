Before you tell me to go
I've got to let you know
How you're makin' my temperature rise
I let you use me
You tried to abuse me
You tell me you're not very nice

I'm not your social security
I'm not your star opportunity... yeah
Oh baby, you can have me absolutely
Won't you give me

True confessions
True confessions
True confessions

That's all I'm askin' for... yeah

I do things to make you
Crazy inside
And baby that's one thing
...
