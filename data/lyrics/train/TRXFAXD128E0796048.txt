The ceiling's too familiar
Laying slackjawed on my back
and words spill out like puzzles
as she tries to fill the gap
But my lover's not my mother
And the hands that wipe my ass
Are the hands that once caressed me
I don't want them to detest me

And I will not burden those I love
I will not be a spoon fed bird
...
