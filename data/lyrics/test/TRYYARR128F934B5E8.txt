You're steeling my pride, while my unrest grows
I'm moving but failed all my veins
Protecting or breathing, I stopped in between
As the arms of the night opened wide
As my life burst out, into madness I see
At midnight the flames are burning me
I've chosen my fear, I'm forced into hate
While memories are turning to fate
