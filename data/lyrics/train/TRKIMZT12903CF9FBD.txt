I wouldn't mess you, wouldn't wanna stress you
'cause we're friends and I don't want that to change
but last night when you kissed me goodbye,
don't know why but I was feeling strange
like I didnt want to leave you, wanted to protect you, wanna see you smile all night
I thought maybe I was crazy baby, but when you touched me it felt so right
