I, I'm stuck in love with you
I can't bend these pimping rules
No more than I been flexing them
Buddy love, Spandexing and if you ain't know

I play by rules an I'm ma keep on
At least that the plan but if you keep on
I might be forced to leave game alone
(You hot like fire)
It hurts to the touch

You burning pimp my game
(I'm avoiding)
Long talks on the phone
'Cause you might have me gone
My lady, if you keep on

(On, on, on, on)
Moving your hips right, my lover, keep on
Smacking your lips right, my lover, keep on
Calling me papi, my lover, keep on
Thinking 'bout me, my lover, keep on

Rocking Prada, my lover, keep on
Working it out ma, my lover, keep on
Doing your damn thing, my lover, keep on
Making me sing this song about you

No captain save her, my moor dawdle goings
...
