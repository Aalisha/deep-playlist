I want to smash it up for all the workers
Who spent hours into nothing
I want to smash it up for all my sisters
Who got caught up in this funky system
I want to smash it up just like a locust
Like a satellite shooting rockets
I want to smash it up in every way I can
And right now I think I want to be your man

Smash it up yeah when I'm down

I want to smash it up for all the kids who
Who got fucked up just like their parents did
I want to smash it up, the gods and masters
