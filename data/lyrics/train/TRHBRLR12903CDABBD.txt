Mother was angered, father pretended
I love you more than I can say
I will be lonely, if you don't need me
Loving me ever remain
So come in my arms tonight
And fly away with me

Oh, dreamboat, take us up and bring us to the sky
Dreamboat, let's go sailing through the starry night
Dreamboat, heaven will be not so far away
Let us be forever there to leave me never
Dream a little dream each night and day
