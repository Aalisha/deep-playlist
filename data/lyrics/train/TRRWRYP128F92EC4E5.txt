The demons were planning on having a party one night.
They had beer, Jack Daniels, and pretzels,
there was red wine, some white.
They were celebrating how they crusified Christ on that tree.
But Satan, the snake himself, wasn't so at ease.
Well, he took his crooked finger,
And he dialed the phone by his bed,
To call an old faithful, to see if he was dead.
"Hey grave, what's going on, did my plan fail?"
Grave just laughed and said, "The dude's dead as nails."

*chorus*
On Friday night, they crucified the Lord at calvary,
But he said, "Don't dread, three days' later I'll live again, you'll see!"
When problems try to bury you, make it hard to pray,
It may seem like Friday night, but Sunday's on the way!

A tranquilizer and a horror filck, couldn't calm Satan's fears.
So Saturday night, he calls up the grave, scared of what he'd hear.
