What is the use of words
If they don´t make her seen or heard?
She watches dust to dust unstirred
Though left behind
She is too weak to grieve or blame us,
We who leave.

There is no hour of bliss
When ignorance can lead to this.
Don´t let the hand of time be kind
And smooth her gently from my mind.

Let me be troubled.
Let me be troubled.
