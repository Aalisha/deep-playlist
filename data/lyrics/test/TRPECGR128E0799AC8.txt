She was like nothing I've ever known
Her eyes shined like diamonds in a field of snow
Man that destiny led her to me
Made her feel that life was now complete

Now a thousand days have passed and nights gone by
You can see the glow slowly fading from her eyes
Though she denies her pain and her dismay
Know I said this to her anyway

Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry (makes you cry)
You'll end up killing
All the love you have inside (have inside)
Can't hope to see the sun in you
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by
Don't let real love pass you by

I know you're nervous but take it from me
'Cause you deserve so much more than you recieve
Listen to your heart and let it show
Dont hold onto your pain just let it go
Let it go

Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry (makes you cry)
You'll end up killing
All the love you have inside
