Think I'll take a walk
And maybe it'll clear my head
Lord I'm so confused maybe
I'll just stay here in bed

'cause I like when you invite
Your friends around
And I like it when we spend
The night on the town
I even like it when we're
Caught in a crowd
I don't know why but I can't decide
I just want to treat you right

But it ain't that simple
Every choice is hard to make
Baby ain't that simple
Hey hey hey
