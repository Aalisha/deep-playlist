This world can take you by the hand
And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one way is wrong
The flesh is weak, but love is strong
And she's all I see between the devil and me

The gates of hell swing open wide invitin' me to step inside
I'll be your friend, he calls again, I know it's him
...
