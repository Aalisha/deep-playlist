Stupid on the Steinway
So sick upon a Steinway
The sailors drown
See them talk and see them drown
And see them drink and fall around
Upon the floor
Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again
Lonely in a crowded room
The radio plays out of tune
So silently
The radio upon the floor
Is stupid it plays Aznavour
So out of key
