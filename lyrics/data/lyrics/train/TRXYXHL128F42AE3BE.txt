Baby!
You don't wanna make me cry
or I will fill you with the emptiness inside.

Okay! Alright!

Baby!
You don't wanna say goodbye
or I will soak you in this rich formaldehyde.

Cause you're beautiful tonight
and the stars are burning bright.
And I give this curse to you
like there is nothing else to do.

So let the purple sky explode.
Let it shower with us toads.
Let the scarlet river flood
