Hey Cesar!
when are you picking us up?
cause we got
flights that we gotta miss
waves to catch
we need sleep and we're pissed
gotta go
cause we've been dreaming of this now

hi-voltage running thru my lips
and I don't give a fuck about the p.a. system
the president is taking you off the grid
well I hope you survive the neo-liberal threats

breaking down
coming up unwound
in the end
what the fuck are we supposed to do?
blowing a fuse
what the fuck are we supposed to do?
blowing a fuse
