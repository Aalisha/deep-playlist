Well, I ain't too sure about this so-called trial seperation
I mean it's been three whole days
And I don't know if I can take anymore
And I know I'm the constant source of your frustration
But here I am again knockin' at your door

And i'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
'Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good at not lovin' you
