I said a hey you guys
look who's awaitin' outside.
Well she got style you can see it in her feline eyes.
When she starts movin' you sure can tell
When she starts shakin' she's raisin' hell.
I said a hey you guys

Do you remember how she left that floor last Saturday night.
When the cat broke loose well she darn near started the figh
Well she may be flashin' like a neon sign
But you can't touch her 'cause she's mine all mine.
I said a hey you guys look who's awaitin' outside.

And then the cat crept in and crept out again
The cat crept in and crept out again
So I open the door for that high-heeled paw
