Every mornin' praise I sing to Thee
You're slow to wrath and swift to bless my soul
Your love endures unchanging, oh Hallelujah

Cover me with Your grace
Shine on me with Your light
Take Your arms, hold me tight
Keep me caught in the moment

Cover me with Your grace
Shine on me with Your light
Take Your arms, hold me tight
Keep me caught in the moment

Every night I pray myself to sleep
I look to You and plead, my soul You'll keep, yeah
You endure unchanging, oh Hallelujah

Cover me with Your grace
