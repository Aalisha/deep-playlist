Squalid conditions, unsanitary
Vermin, infested, dwellings ordinary
Plagued rats, lice and fleas
Cohabitating human race

Subliminal terror spawns
Onslaught of the plague, mass extermination
Mourning, and sickness, disease and prevalent
Invading, bacilli

Eradicating all the world
Hysterical panic builds
High fever, chills and buboes boil
Lymph nodes swell, inflicting blackened pain

Delirium, violent emerods
Blood letting fails to ostracize
Septicemic human bordered death
Black death consumes populace at crippling velocity

Chaos reins supreme in plague ravaged cities
...
