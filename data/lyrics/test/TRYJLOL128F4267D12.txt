Ridin' the storm out, waitin' for the thaw out
On a full moon night in the rocky mountain winter
Wine bottle's are low, watching for the snow
Thinking about what have I've been missing in the city

And I'm not missing a thing
Just watchin' the full moon crossing the range
Ridin' the storm out, ridin' the storm out
Ridin' the storm out, ridin' the storm out
