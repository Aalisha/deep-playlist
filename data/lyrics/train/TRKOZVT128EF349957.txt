Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah

You had the sweetest boy in the world
Without a doubt you were the envy of every girl
You're the kind that's never satisfied
You want every boy to pass you by
But the tables turned (the tables turned)
'Cause his words tell you're done
Now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
You thought it was fun to make the boys run

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
