Seven tears have flown into the river

Seven tears are runnin' to the sea.
If one day they reach some distant waters

Then you'll know
it's sent with love from me.
Here I stand
head in hand
Lonely like a stranger on the shore.
I can't stand this feeling anymore.
Day by day
this world's all grey
And if dreams were eagles I would fly
