Down down down rudup do, let's go steady again
Down down down rudup do, let's go steady again

Let's go steady again like we did before
Let's go steady again and be lovers once more
Wear my ring around your neck like you used to do
Don't you know it's wrong to break
Come on baby let's kiss and make up
