Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Oh keep your heart for me for someday I'll return ad you know you're the only one I'll ever love

Too many miles
Too many stars
Too many moons to change your mind
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong
When the stars come out remember you are mine
