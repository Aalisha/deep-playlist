The drought lives on in minds that starve
As children grab their guns and line up to die like dogs
And our hollow headlines, oh, they just prove to warn
Yeah, calling in the time's read today,
"If you're not confused then you're not well informed"

You don't need to see something to know it needs to change
It must be easy to believe in nothing
Turn around and walk away

This silence echoes, the joke is never grasped
...
