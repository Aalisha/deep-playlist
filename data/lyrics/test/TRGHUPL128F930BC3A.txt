"This is!", "This is!"

Words, Words forming in my brain
I plead insanity but feel inanity
my wits permitting
I feel my weight of old reaction
thought caching, I play the game
around the flip floor, suction
check out, with me lick lips
spinning turn it on, flip my switch
sean is gonna sing from the beggining
words tend to distraction, this is your
madcap rapper this is my condition.

check, ... tied your hands behind your back.

Dreamer, Dreamer. Keep on dreaming

And the devil caught you at the game
these words keep sprawling in your brain

feel the connection to mother earth and
the father of the earth move wide isn't it
...
