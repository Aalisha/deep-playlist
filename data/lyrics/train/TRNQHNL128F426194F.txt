i walk with a head full of fire,
and a belly full of hunger pain,
uncontained rage takes hold 'til i'm numb again,
clear the air like summer rain,
it's just another day seen through the eye of the hurricane,
runaway train of thought, my sore knuckles say love and hate,
huffing shakes straight 'til i suffocate,
b-boy unengaged til my brain's buzzin', ain't nothin' changed,
decorate grey skies with colour- spray paint tornadoes,
fallen angel with a worn halo, moonwalk on a rainbow,
multi-verse space ghost writer, spit a day-glo one-liner,
the tongue tied long timer, invisible ink specialist,
i think devilish, sipping on a alcoholic beverage,
livin' with benefit cheats and no-hopers, stoners!,
deadbeats who sleep on the sofas, socialite soldiers,
glued to the motorola, worldwide like coca-cola,
weed network, exert energy the head-nod expert,
trenchfoot puttin' in legwork, the wordsmith,
still lifted off the first spliff,
...
