Slaves to the slaughter
Marching on to your death
Like a cannonery of beast angels
On the bones of a million dead
Through the womb of night
Into nuclear fire storms
Neuro-active limbic death
Vengance be fulfilled

Primus tyrant
Nuclear retributionist
War-smith despoiler
Wickedness for the wickeds sake
...
