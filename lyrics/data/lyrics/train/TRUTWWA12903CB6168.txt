{"Ohhhhh, Teddy Ted!"

[Smooth Bee]
Teddy Ted, that's what I said
He and Special K are like Barney and Fred
(Greg Nice) Smooth Bee is MC's
We grow from roots to trees and then leaves
When he's strollin, high-rollin
All the girlies on the block he's controllin
He's Teddy Ted baby, livin care free
You don't scare him, so don't fear him
We're all equal, so be peaceful
