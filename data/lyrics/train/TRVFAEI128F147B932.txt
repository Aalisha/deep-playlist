as i step outside this bitter conflict of life
i ponder if her cries can stop the star from flight
the fall wind blows
off the ocean
as it whist by the tips of trees
who were silent
just like i am
at the sight of their dying leaves
and i've just returned
from the first time we have heard
realizing what i had
guess i'll never get it back
oh-oh
and look at how windswept my life's become
since you left
your nowhere but my spinning head
she use to walk
beside the pier
as the break water disabled
the coming swirls
so i run there
to find lover all strewn all about
...
