Didn't expect any of this
But it was really nice
Didnt want you to cause a fuss
But it feels alive

So Thank you very much
Its really nice to know
That you enjoyed the show
And I want you to know when to go
Cos this should be a thrill
But it feels like a drill
Now you must let me go, let me go

I just imagine that I'm you
