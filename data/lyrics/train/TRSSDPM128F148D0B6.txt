You're perfect in the way
A perfect end today
You're burning out their lights
And burning in their eyes
I love you, sugar kane
A-comin' from the rain
Oh, kiss me like a frog
And turn me into flame
I love you all the time
I need you 8 to 9
And I can stay all night
Your body shining

And I know
There's something down there, sugar soul
...
