Let's go, let's go, let's go, KL
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, hey, let's go, let's go

Hey, there sexy lady over there
Hey, girl, what's up
Girl, you looking so good
Girl I swear that I wanna have you on my team
No bench baby girl, you can start for me
Number one

It's okay if you wanna, girl
If you wanna hold the bar down, girl
Cause you stand out, girl
Anywhere that you are, girl

You the number one stunna in here
Girl, you got me thinking about getting outta here
And going to da crib
If you're wit me, baby girl, are you wit me
You're like something outta a dream
Face like Heliana and a body like freak
