I don't need to fuss
I don't need to fight
I wanna party
Coz I'm feeling alright tonight
Classy but simple
Sneakers so clean
When I step in the venue
I know they know me 

[Chorus:]
I'm so cool, I'm so fly
I'm so fresh! Fresh!
I'm so cool, I'm so fly
(Bah b-bah, bah, bah, bah)
I'm so Fresh! 

Lady I see you
Looking my way
I know that you want me
