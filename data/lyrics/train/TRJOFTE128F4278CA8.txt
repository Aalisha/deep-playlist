I've been goo-goo ga-ga since the day we met
Call me the biggest the fool the world's seen yet
I go all to pieces when I hear your name
I admit that I've gone insane
Light in the head, weak in the knees
Girl you got me beggin' baby please, please, please.

Crazy 'bout you baby what can I do
Crazy 'bout you baby.
Crazy 'bout you baby I'm in love with you
Everything about you makes my heart go boom

Girl I get the shivers everytime we touch
This ain't your ordinary schoolboy crush
Spend all day dreamin' how it's gonna be
When the sun goes down and you're next to me
Kissin' and a huggin' and a lovin' all night.
