Ah, uh, uh, oh, ah, uh, uh, oh
Ah, uh, uh, oh, ah, uh, uh, oh, na, na, naii
Ah, uh, uh, oh, ah, uh, uh, oh, Tinchy Stryder
Ah, uh, uh, oh, N Dubz, ah, uh, uh, oh, yo

It was nothing but a quick thing
Kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring
Watch how it glistens

It was done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called, don't go
Now it's just you and me on a love row

Dappy like dino, us two, tip toes, duck dive, get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now were deep in way past intro
Dappy explain yo

See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You're number one

See I don't understand how you're number one
When it was just a fling before, now you're the one
See all I did was blink twice, from my homie to my only
Number one
