If I believe in lo-ove
yes i believe in love
Once said thats true
Girl, I made a sacrfice for you - ah
For the bingie man ya jus need to go thru - ah
Everyday you make my grey sky blue - ah
I always wanna teach you soumting new - ah
But you caught up within your worl' - ah
I see you mixed up within your mind - ah
Always wanna be some one else
And never wanna be your own self
But a home and away now
Your missin' all da charms - ah, yeah yeah ya
Home and away girl
Away from your arms - ah, yeah yeah ya
Home and away girl
I see you missin' all da charms - ah, yeah yeah ya
Home and away girl
Away from the bingie man arms, yeah yeah yeah
And girl i'm so happy that i made it thru
This song i'm singing is jus' to let you knooww, yeah yeah
Can't afford to be sharin' you
