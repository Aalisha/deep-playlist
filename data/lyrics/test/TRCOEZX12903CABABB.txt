The sun is rising up on the east side
A chance for everyone
I've been dreaming of the city for a long time
Far from my home town
(You...) I see... (Will see...) My dream...
(Your dream...) for real... (Come true...)
(You...) I will... (Will rise...) will rise...
(Above...) above... (The room...)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear (Love, release our mind)
Not going to mess around (You are what you want)
Mum and Daddy would be so proud (Time is taking lies)
City please don't let me down (You are what you mean)

Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
Can you help me hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
