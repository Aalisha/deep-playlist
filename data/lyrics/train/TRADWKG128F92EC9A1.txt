You were watching me eat
You were watching me sleep
You were a willing sheep
And I was little-bo-peep and
You were writing it down and
You were looking for cracks but I
Look good with a knife in my back

Valentine,
I'm all mine
Valentine,
I'm all mine

With a flick of my wrist and
With a twitch of my lid
I'll make you wish like hell
...
