So long I've waited for you to come to me
anticipated what I would say.
And no one could know how it feels to be
in your embrace again
so tender.
Yes
there were times I could not hold on
Each day that came a little more hope was gone.
I'd look into my heart to see what I had done
And now I can't believe
the day is finally come!
