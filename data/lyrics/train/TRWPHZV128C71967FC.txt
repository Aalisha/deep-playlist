I can't believe she's goin'
I said please show me
What selfish seeds I plant along the way
Black harvest today

The empty bed she left me
Cold on one side
Can't believe, only me
Shadows in purple thrill me

I cry myself awake each night
I can't believe that it's true
Here am I, where are you?

Can I cope with today?
My love is leavin' me
Still I'm hoping she'll stay
My love is leavin' me

But I'll control my feelings
...
