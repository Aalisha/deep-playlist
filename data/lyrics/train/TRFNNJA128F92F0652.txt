Been standing here for ages
Watching the valleys blossom and burn
The pyres of yesterday smells of losing you
Preserved we are, portraits (in the glassy depths)
I picked up the shattered mirror, put them in water
Cold as my dreams

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead
