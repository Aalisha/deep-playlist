Did you think it wouldn't show, you're here with me, but I'm so alone
And now this house don't feel like home, I can't believe how much we've grown
So far apart, so far away, you just can't hide something as plain as day
I think it's safe to say, that's it's just no good

And I don't need you in my life, the way you cut me like a knife
You burned me once, but now that it's done, you'll never burn me twice

Now that it's all been said and done, do you like what you've become
Now that it's all but over, you haven't changed, and what a shame
...
