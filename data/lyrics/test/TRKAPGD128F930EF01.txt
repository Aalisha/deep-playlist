Sin and its ways grow old
All of my heart turns to stone
And I'm left with no strength to arise
How You need to be lifted high

Sin and its ways lead to pain
Left here with hurt and with shame
So no longer will I leave Your side
Jesus, You'll be lifted high

You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high
...
