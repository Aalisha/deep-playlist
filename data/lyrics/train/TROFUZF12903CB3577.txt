One, two, one, two, three

Looking forward to seeing you
Why it's been such a long, long time?
Looking forward to feeling your
Love has been so heavy on my mind
On my mind, all the time on my mind

Had a chance to look forward
To be part of your love in my dreams
But I can't be happy with
Fantasizing instead of the real thing
The real thing, not my dreams, the real thing

There are no words that can express the way I feel today
