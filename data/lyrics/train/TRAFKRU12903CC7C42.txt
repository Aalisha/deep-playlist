Always thought she'd stick around
always thought she'd stay
Now he's searching for the ring
the one she had to throw away
beach comber casts a shadow
long as his beard
never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared
she left him in this crazy state he's in
scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring
oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger
she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer
there's a rhythm to his madness
a rhythm that he's in
...
