On the freeway, all the cares have stopped
'Cause the big news has dropped
All the phones are ringing
It's got all the neighbors singing

Police chief is calling the detectives
Navy SEALs are being selected
President is calling his advisors
Greenpeace is putting out flyers

We've got ourselves a little situation
It's worse than an alien invasion
Jennifer has got a cold and
Everybody's got to know

We've got ourselves a little situation
It's worse than an alien invasion
Jennifer has got a cold and
She can't complain to no one
