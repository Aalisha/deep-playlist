Oh how I missed you,
Oh how I needed you today,
Oh how I missed you,
Oh how I needed you today,

'Cause life is like a waste of time,
When you're not by my side,
When you're not on this ride,

So pack your bags there's nothing to it,
Call in sick and stay,
With me everyday,
Call in sick and run away.

Have you been dreaming?
Have you been wondering the same?
