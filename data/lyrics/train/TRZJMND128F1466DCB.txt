Look through the window
Look through the window
Look through the window
I'm looking through a pane of glass

Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
I'm looking through a pane of glass

I'm so restless
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
We talk about this and we talk about that

I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
