You are good
And your love endures
You are good
And your love endures
You are good
And your love endures
Today
Lord let your glory fall
As on that ancient day
Songs of enduring love
And then your glory came
And as a sign to you
That we would love the same
Our hearts will sing that song
Lord let your glory come
You are good
