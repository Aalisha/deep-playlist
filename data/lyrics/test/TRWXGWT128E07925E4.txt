Where my ladies at
Where the fellas at
Now where the dogs at
Where the cats at

Pussycats
(Yeah all the ladies)
Keep it tight
(Say what?)
Even if they bark all night
(Now lemme see y'all wave your hands from side to side)
With a knick knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone

Momma, you should've seen what he done to me
I said "Momma
I should've took your advice"

'Cause Palo was a woman's thorn
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
Stay away from those hot boys
'Cause I don't want you to get burned

Pussycats
(Shut 'em down, shut 'em down)
Keep it tight
(No matter what they do)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
'Cause if he hit it
You gonna be all alone

Pussycats
(Said shut 'em down, keep it closed)
Keep it tight
(No matter what they may do)
Even if they bark all night
(All night, all night)
With a knick-knack patty wack
Don't give a dog a bone
