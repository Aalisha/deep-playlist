Hello, goodbye, I wanted to see, but I guess I
I don't have the strength to speak tonight
It's tricky sometimes
When you wanted to run, you'd always hide
You can't find the truth behind the lies

Another day and I'm on my feet
But the street feels like it's sleeping
I'm on a mission and it ain't too sweet
Yeah, you're the reason, I'm afraid
Said, you're the reason, I'm afraid

But I want you to know, it's killing me
I think I gotta let go 'cause it's killing me
You're gonna do what you want
But you better believe, it's killing me

Love never dies
It's the reason that I won't compromise
...
