How men be so greedy
When there's so much left?
All things are God-given
And they all have been blessed
Why can't we be humble
Like the good Lord say?
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Oh, that's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Let not your heart be troubled
Let mourning, sobbing cease
Learn to love your brothers and
And live in perfect peace
...
