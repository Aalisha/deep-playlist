Loving you, is easy
cause you´re beautiful
every day of my life
i´m more in love with you
loving you
i feel you soul come shining through
and every time we, ooh
i´m more in love with you
la la la la la, la la la la la
la la la la la, la la la la la la
doo-be-doo, doo-dooooo
a-a-a-a-a-ah

no one else can make me see
the colours that you bring
stay with me, we´ll grow old
and we can spend
each day in spring time
