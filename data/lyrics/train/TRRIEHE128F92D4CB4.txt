I'd like to dedicate this song to Little Junior Parker, a cousin of mine who's gone on but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name, by singing

I don't know why I love like I do
After all the changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay, hey, hey

Take me to the river
Wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground
