Well lately I've been thinkin'
About some good home cookin'
Just like I havn't eaten in the longest time
Now I like potato chips now please don't get me wrong
But I haven't tasted momma's rhubarb pie in so very long

chorus

Rhubarb pie in the summer
Rhubarb pie made by my mother
Nothing better in the winter
Than rhubarb pie after dinnner

Twinkies may be better
Than a hole in the sweater
And the hole in the sweater
beats a poke in the eye
If I had my choice I'd leave this
...
