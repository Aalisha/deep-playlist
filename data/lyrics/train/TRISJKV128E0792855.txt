Now see I try to keep the peace
But your lies is killin me
Yo ass is in these streets
On them bogus late night creeps
You said you were with your boys
Then tried to switch it
Go head with the bullshit
Cause I ain't none of these bitches
The truth is coming to get cha
Pain is about to split cha
You done put your hands on me
And Dre is about to get with cha
I done messed around and spotted you
Like you was famous
Now you got the dumb look on your face like
What cha name is?
Nigga I know what cha game is
You done lied to me so much its painless
Boy you took mommies first seed for granted
Now your cheating ass is about to be strained

Cause most of ya'll niggas can't deal with the TRUTH
Be hatin when you woman start hit you with the TRUTH
Trying to turn it all around when you know it's the TRUTH
And you always running away from the TRUTH
You lied til you make yourself think it's the TRUTH
Undress the lie tell what you got TRUTH
