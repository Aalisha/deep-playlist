You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love,
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony,
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.
