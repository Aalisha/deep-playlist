We are addicted
Addicted to your habits
We are distressed when
Youâ€˜re not around

Keep the fire burning
Keep the smoke coming
(Smoke)

Our days are wasted
If we don't receive your comfort
You cast a spell
You silence every sound

Brothers become enemies
Prepared for any felony
Craving for felicity
Ready for atrocity

You strike a match and you smile
And all I can do
Is smile together with you

You lace the wine with a single tear
