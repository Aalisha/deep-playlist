Oh you're so far away, I can't share anything with you
So come on over here, for a moment before it's too late
I got no more time, for sitting around
For sitting around, fantasizing
So I want to
So I want to
So I want to
So I want to feel you, So move a little closer
I want to touch you, so move a little closer
Feel you, so move a little closer
I want to touch you, so move a little closer
