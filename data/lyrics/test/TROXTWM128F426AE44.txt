I've been all around this great big world
to Paris and Rome
And I've never found a place that I could
really call my own.
But there'se one place where I know
the sun is shining endlessly
And it's calling me across the sea
so I must get back to SAN BERNADINO.

I remember when I was sixteen
my daddy said to me: You could travel
round this universe until eternity
But you'll never find that peace of mind
that you've been dreaming of.
