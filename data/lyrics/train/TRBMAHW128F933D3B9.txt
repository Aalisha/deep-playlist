(Dicky Barrett/Nate Albert/Joe Gittleman)

when he left, he showed up at my door, different than he was before
I was scared, and he was way off track I thought he wasn't coming back
he told me, people were out after him and talked of places that he'd never been,
on a mission, and sworn to secrecy, different than he used to be
back, back, and we're glad he's back on track! It's good to have him back, he's back
back, back, and we're glad he's back on track! It's good to have him back, he's back
when he was gone, he slept out on my couch in the daytime he was always out
