[Intro: Defari Talking]
Yeah this for all my inner towners
My Los Angelinos
From Pico to Rosecrans
From Lincoln to Crenshaw
From Crenshaw to Main
Uh Huh

Municipal, What (it's the city)

L.A.

[Verse 1: Defari]
Call all the women and all the kings men 
The Jewel of Los Angeles is back again
DEFARI
Colder than Ice, hittin like dice
That are fixed, the cold trick pulled in front of your eyes
I'm goin Back to back back 
Kobe and Shaq
Catch me flying down Pico with a Laker Flag
While every squares all U.S.A 
I'm all L.A
Black and Brown town get down with Nig's & Eses (S.A's)
And white boys downer than most niggaz 
Especially when it come to hustling hard for these figures
L.A
Where the sun shine every day it's all good 
Sticky ass loads and haircuts in Inglewood
Classics sittin on rallies or D's 
Yall Niggaz can't fuck wit these
(Ah!)

[Chorus]
Life amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost angels 
In the city we work the angles
And Live amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost Angels
