Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken,
Piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling,
Unburied corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment,
Torso's torn in two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue,
Butchered for human stew

Crawl into the cadaver head first,
Eat your way through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards
Is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck up vomit through intestines
Leaving nothing but bones

Violently cutting, seriously hacking,
Sounds of death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets,
Blood spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head,
Smearing remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking,
Sounds of death fill the air

Blistering flesh, another death,
Stiffened bones, morbid groans
Evil minds, brains oozing slime,
Feel the pain

Body weak brain contorting,
Fluid flowing from your organs
Veins torn out, Mangled
