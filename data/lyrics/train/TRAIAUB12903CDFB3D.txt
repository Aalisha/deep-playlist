Why boasteth thyself, oh evil men
playing smart and being clever, oh no
I say, you're working inequity
to achieve vanity, yeah, if I sow I sow
but the goodness of Jah, Jah
I'doreth for Iver

If you are a big tree,
We are the small axe
sharpened to cut you down (we shall)
ready to cut you down, oh yeah
