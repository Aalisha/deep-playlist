Fingers blistered from the nightly scratching
at the window which won't open
far enough to let air in.

The house wins.
Oh the house always wins.

Feral cats are screaming
At the clouds beneath the window
With the crack so small that nothing gets within.

The house wins.
Oh the house always wins.

You don't have to be alone to be lonely,
You might as well give in.

Telephones are howling
At the cats out in the alley
...
