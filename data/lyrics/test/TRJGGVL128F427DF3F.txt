Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy".
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to you...

But it was just my imagination
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married.
and raise a family.
in a cozy, little home out in the country
...
