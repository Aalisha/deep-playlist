We're guilty as charged
It's staring us in the face
We missed our last chance
Now Bevan spins round in his grave
Time to charge the gates
We're guilty as charged
There's no love left in the left
We're guilty as charged
The party is close to its death
Slowly moving west
Come play your part
We're crying mayday
