Yeah, tonight's your night, baby.
Whatever you want, whatever you need, it's on me.


Oh, how do you like your love served? Tell me what you think you deserve.
How do you like it?
How do you like it, how do you like it, baby?
How do you like your love served? Girl, just give me the word.
How do you like it?


Here I am for your pleasure. I just wanna make you happy, girl.
Baby, no no no pressure.
Satisfaction guaranteed, if you want full service, baby, pull up on me.
I wanna caress you, and maybe undress you, oh yeah.
And maybe undress ya, oh yeah
I'll do all of that and more, give you the love that you've been waiting for.
I wanna fulfill you, oh, I swear that I'll thrill you, oh yeah.
