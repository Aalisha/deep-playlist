I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be misunderstood

I'll never understand
How my fellow man
Can live behind the wall of fears, yeah

We need deliverance
From this ignorance
'Cause the world, it hasn't changed for years

In the garden we were started
To know the difference from right and wrong
And I'm singing my song

I don't wanna be misunderstood
Walking in the light of brotherhood
I don't wanna be misunderstood

Don't look at me with judging eyes
Open your heart to all mankind
I don't wanna be misunderstood

We're just flesh and blood
Running from the flood
Don't you know we're all the same, yeah
