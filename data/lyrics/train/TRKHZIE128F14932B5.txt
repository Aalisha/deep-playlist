Come on everybody I'm back in town
Gonna bring you up, gonna shake you down
Gonna set you up to another place
Gonna wipe that smile back on your face

I'm calling all the home girls in L.A.
I've got some thing good, gonna come your way
All the fine girls from old Times Square
I love your style and savour faire

Don't want your conversation
Don't want to talk about trust
I want excitation
I want your Dirty Luv
Dirty Luv
