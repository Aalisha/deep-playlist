Beautiful feather hovering overground
We're similar
We're both being pushed by the wind
Through the air
To wherever
Haven't I seen you before?
Haven't you been here before?
As we both sit here together
Whatever
As the wind blows...

It's so supernatural, It's so supernatural
Let it fly

Wonderful words lying in the grass
We're similar
...
