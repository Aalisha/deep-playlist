We can do it nice and slow
It's six o'clock
It's getting dark
And we're all alone
So dim the lights
Lock the door
Baby come on
'Cause I've waited for this moment
For so long I don't want just anybody
Who wants to get it on
I don't think that I can hold my feelings
Back no more
So baby please stop
Oh it's getting hot
Girl you better not
Why you always wanna tease me
I don't wanna waste no time
So bring your body close to mine
We can do it nice and slow
And easy
I don't wanna waste no time
So baby just let it all unwind
