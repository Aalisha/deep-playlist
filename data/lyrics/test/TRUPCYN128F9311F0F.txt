Here comes that rainy day feeling again, and soon my tears will be falling like rain...
It always seems to be a Monday,
Leftover memories of Sunday always spent with you.
Before the clouds appeared, and took away my sunshine.
Here comes that rainy day feeling again, and I'll be dreaming of you baby in vain. Your face is always on my mind, girl,
I'm hoping you're soon gonna find, girl, your way back to me,
'cause if you'll say you'll stay, the rainy days will go away...
