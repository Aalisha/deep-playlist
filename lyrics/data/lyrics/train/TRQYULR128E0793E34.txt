(Keith, Skeoch, Hannon, Wheat, Luccketta))

One two three four!

I can't believe this fucked up world in which we're livin' in
Still I do the best that I can
Always got me on the lookout for a getaway
Runnin' hard, I'm a rock 'n' roll man

I know we can make it [and go, said that] all you gotta do is sign
Tellin' you all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll

[Chorus:]
