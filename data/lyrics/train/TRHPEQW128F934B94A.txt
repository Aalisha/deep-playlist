Blackened skies surround me
When I cut my veins
Everytime it is the same
Ash is falling rain
But why?

Floating down to earth
Burnt human remains
Choking all who inhale
This ashen falling rain

Wading through a sea of black
The mothers hunter their young
As starving beasts, a carnal curse
Apocalyptic dwellers, thin and grey
...
