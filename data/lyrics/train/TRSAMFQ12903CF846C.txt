(feat. Treach)

[Chorus]
Only if you want it
Yes I really want it
[x4]

[Eazy-E]
Can I get an eye open up
Eazy locin' up
smokin' up
much dust like a nut what
give it up for the real stuff
shut the what up
back the shut up what
hustler from the hood hoe
hopin' and mud rub
the finishin' touches
would sure went rubbers
comin' in bunches
could serve like lunches
hold ya horses here's where the source is
not very tall but never took a short kid
with a clip to claw
wouldn't draw Mcgraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw
a naughty shorty, sporty with a forty
a laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy
...
