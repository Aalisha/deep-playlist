Because your reasons are as cool as ice
And your mind somehow paid the price
You'll pay it again--somewhere--on down the line
When you're there I'm sure you'll stare
And I'll be behind you

Because your day is a clock of grey hours
And your smile has those tallest powers
But sometimes, Jezebelle, it shines like the sun
...
