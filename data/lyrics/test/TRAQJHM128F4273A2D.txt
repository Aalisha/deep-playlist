Won't you touch me baby boy
I need happiness so let's rejoyce
Feeling motion trip your body
You'll be forever my baby boy

Just caress me baby boy
I need a little love and you're my choise
Feel sensation lift your body
We'll be together my baby boy

My my my my my baby
My my my my my baby
My my my my my baby boy

My my my my my baby
