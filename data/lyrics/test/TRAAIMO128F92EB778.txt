I'd stick around if you tell me I'm yours
But don't leave your keys for me, open the door
Nobody's getting hurt here if nobody cares
Nobody's getting lost if nobody's going anywhere

And darling I know that you can't be sure of anything anymore

I wanna love you like it ain't no secret
Like I'm not ashamed to show
Nor would I ever, oh never never
Oh never let you go
I'll never let you go
