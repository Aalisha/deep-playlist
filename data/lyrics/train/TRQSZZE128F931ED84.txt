This means you to me now
The atmosphere, the lines
This whole place somehow
These people with their faces
The music and the sound
Familiar but strange
When you're not around
And this means you to me now
The corner by the bar
Belongs to us somehow
I'm watching my glass
But can't see why my beer
Always taste so special
When you're with me here
