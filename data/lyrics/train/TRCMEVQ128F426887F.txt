Push, shove
Push, shove
Don't you push, don't you shove
Don't you push, don't you shove

My daddy would go crazy
If he knew what his baby
Was spendin' his life doin',
I know I'd be in trouble
He would cut out on the double
At the lifestyle I'm pursuin'

* I wanna be a toy!
I can't be treated
Like no ordinary boy!
I wanna be a toy!
I can't be treated
...
