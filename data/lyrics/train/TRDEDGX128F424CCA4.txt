This is a story about elisabeth bathory
her blood is ourselfs...
clean, hungarian blood...
Dark castle,
occult carols sound,
woman... crying
... eternally satisfied
elisabeth did not slept tonight
her gouth ensorcelled through black eyes
the dead girls are courting her
upon deasdly magic circles lines
she pierce needles under ladys nails
...
