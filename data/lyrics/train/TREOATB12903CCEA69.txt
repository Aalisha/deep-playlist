Jowes after 999, turned frankenstein
And led the squad, black leather prod, in pillage and decline
The houses houses that were slain,
Attention we would gain,
The mindles fun had just begun, now done we will remain
The slashes have all healed, the history is sealed,
Inside our minds, its all behind the havoc we have wield

[Chorus]
