I can't get a girl
cuz I ain't got a car
I can't get a car
cuz I ain't got a job
I can't get a job
cuz I ain't got a car
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car
Don't you know where you are

Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America, lost
Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America, lost

I got a mom but I ain't got a dad
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom
