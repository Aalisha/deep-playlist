Grrr, yeah
I mean we all men, we all men
We know how the shit go, love one, fuck another
I mean, it is what it is, it is what it is
I mean, we knew what it was
When we became a part of it
(Yeah)
Ain't no sense whinin' about it now
Feel me? It's like

There's something on your mind
(What?)
I can see right through you
I know your girl been treatin' you wrong
(Yeah)
But she ain't no good for you

Why do you hold it inside
(Uhh)
Boy you should let me know
I just want to make you right
Wanna be the one you could cry on

Baby, it's like I love my wife
But we goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight
You got time for a nigga or is he still with you?
Wanna meet at the same spot or should I come and get you?

Aight, I'll be there in 10, be in the front
I been gettin' what I need so I'ma give you what you want
One-on-one, 'cause you know how to talk to Dog
You walk the dog and understand New York is hard, baby

So you, you ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
Uhh, I ain't goin' nowhere
When you wake up I'm gon' be right there

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I ain't worried about shit
You're here with me
