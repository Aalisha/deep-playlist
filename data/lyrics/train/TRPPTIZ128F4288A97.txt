(Grand Puba)
Yeah
I'd like to send this one to my favorite girl, uhh
Momma momma momma
Ohh momma momma momma, yeahh

(Lord Jamar)
Yo she was young and so tender
Had a baby born Knowledge God day of September
It was her first child, baby boy little bundle of joy
She married Larry, for 9 months she had to carry
me and she did it gladly, but sadly
things didn't all work out, so she merked out
Pregnant again with my brother Wise
My grandmother let her in, she had tears in her eyes
Now she's back at the crib, with 2 kids
She gotta get a job, she put all her faith in God
Naive to the world; believed all the stories
she received as a girl, she had one more seed
Another boy, reality, now that makes 3
All from a man that she hardly ever gets to see
She did the best with the things she was blessed
And I know I cause drama and stress
to my momma, so I wanna just say yo.

(Chorus: Puba (Brand Nubian))
I always loved my momma (she's my favorite girl)
And I always loved my momma (she brought me in this world)
See I always loved my momma (she taught me right from wrong)
Cause I always loved my momma (you only get one, you only get one, yeah)
