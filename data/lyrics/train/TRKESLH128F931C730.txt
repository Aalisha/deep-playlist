You're telling me that I'm the most important thing to you
But can't you see you're killing me with all the things you do?

And I really want to believe it's impossible, I really want to believe it's all a dream
But I just can't seem to wake up, I just can't seem to turn on the light
One step off the edge and the world will seem all right

You did it again, yes you in the mirror
You put your faith in a cruel world
All my dead friends come to haunt, harm and hinder
Never letting go, here to drag me down to Hell
