Look, as far as I can see
Your head is blockin' my TV
What you want for me to say
I said, "Whatever, go away"

What is it that I adore
If you pay me then I'll tell you more
You're looking for some reason why
I'm arrogant (that's right)
And I'll tell you what

Hey, sometimes that's how I do
(That's just how I do)
(That's just how I do)
And if you feel that bad
Maybe it's not for you

Hey, sometimes that's how I do
(That's just how I roll)
(That's just how I stroll)
And if you feel that bad
Maybe it's not for you
