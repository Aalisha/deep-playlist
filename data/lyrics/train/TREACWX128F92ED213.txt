I'm so exited I can't get past one, two, three
I'm so impatient, it's everything you do to me
A little fire mixed in good with desire
Makes my heart sing like a choir
I'm on a respirator whenever he leaves

Cause you stop my heart
I can't focus on anything
Cause you stop my heart
And you get to beat it back again

Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my
Bum bum bum bum bum
You, you stop my heart again
