“Stupid me, why did I sign?” I ask myself as here I find myself sinking in the quicksand of your crime
Have I not done enough for you? Now that you've taken the best of me we're even so why don't you let me leave?
Read what you signed - it tells you that you relinquished all your rights
I can't breathe, I'm in trouble - I never knew that I could bite off more than I can chew
I can't breathe, burst my own bubble - I'm not your fool I'm through with dancing to your tune
