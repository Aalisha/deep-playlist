The night is growing dark
From somewhere deep within
It shelters like an ark
That always takes you in
And the mind goes numb
Until it's feeling no pain
And the soul cries out
For a handful of rain

Wash your women
In your whiskey
When your future's
In the past
And you're staring
Up at heaven
From the bottom
Of a glass
And you need some insulation
From the years you've had and lost
And you feel the perspiration
As you're adding up the cost
...
