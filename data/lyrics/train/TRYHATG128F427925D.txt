Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

Honey, welcome back home
I know she told you, honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did but all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why

But you know, honey I'll always, I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

Oh honey, welcome back home
Don't you know, honey
Honey ain't nobody ever gonna love you the way I try to do?
Who'll take all your pain, and your heartache, too?
