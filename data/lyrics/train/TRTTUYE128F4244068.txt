So you say I got a choice
It looks the same to me
Exchange your culture exchange your tactics
Exchange your weaponry
Exchange your borders for spheres of hatred
And national security
Exchange your life consume this war
Sell it all to me

National security is what we need to feel free
Someone's gonna bleed

National security
Someone's gonna buy

Stockpiles sit and wait for victims
No advertising cost
...
