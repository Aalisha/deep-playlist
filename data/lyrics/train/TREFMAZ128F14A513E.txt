Listen to the sounds of the revolution
everybody's out on the street tonight

Everybody's cool
Everything's alright
Better pray that you're old man don't get home tonight

If we drive my car where the wild things are
We got a green limousine
Everyone's a star but they won't get far without a green limousine

Someone burned the flag on the old convention
Set the wheels in motion here tonight
