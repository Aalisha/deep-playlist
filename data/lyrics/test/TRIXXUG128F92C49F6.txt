I feel so lonely when I'm left alone
And I know
You're having fun
With all the other boys in town.
Why am I the only one?
I'm a first class loser that you don't wanna have around
I keep calling in the dead of night
Until you say you're gonna try treating me right.

Well I know it sounds funny
But I don't wanna be in love
