And every creature, which is in heaven
and on the Earth
under the Earth
and in the Sea
all that are in them
I heard all saying

Glory to Him
who is sitting on The Throne of Chaos
Let His Kingdom come
and shall it Reign for ever and ever
He is The Antichrist, The Darkness, light
Beauty and The Beast
Our only Saviour
in our world of emptiness

I saw that the lamb
had opened one of the Seven Seals
and I heard voice like Thunder saying it to Me

You are The King sitting in The Dark
...
