We get to be a ripple in the water
We get to be a rock thatâ€™s thrown
We get to be a boy on the bridge
Standing over the reservoir

I see the water lap along the shoreline
The buried forest of a man-made lake
Cemeteries are laying underneath it
Your heart like a damm when it breaks.

We are floating, we are swimming
And in this moment we are forgetting
What we costs, what it takes
For one perfect world when we look the other way
