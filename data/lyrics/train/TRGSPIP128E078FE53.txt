Tell Me

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you baby
Tell me

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you baby
Tell me

Anything is possible
Anytime you want it girl let me know
Won't Ask why, just let it flow
Do your thang baby, take control
On my knees, just say the word
No request is gonna go unheard
I'll take my time when I'm lovin' you
Foreplay at one won't end 'til two

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you baby
