Bullshit dinners and the free champagne
Men in suits who think they know it all
No one knows me but they know my name
That's not real to me

Hotel lobby to the aeroplane
Another country but they start to look the same
Watch the world behind a windowpane
That's not real to me

When I see my babies run
When all the madness has been and gone
I'll raise my family and live in peace
Now, that's what's real to me, real to me
...
