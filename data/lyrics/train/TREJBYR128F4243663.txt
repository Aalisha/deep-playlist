Oh, where I go, trouble starts
I'm not compatible with my heart
Oh oh
I could impress, too strong for you
That's the one thing I don't wanna do

Well maybe that's where my heart lies
It is something I have to tame
Trouble follows this bag of bones
And Lucio is my middle name

Sorry for thinking
That we were friends, 
But loyalties come and loyalties go
Isn't that so?
