How magnificent
ey eh ey bounce yea oh ey
Well here it comes now
Earthquake, Black man ah beat the drum
and oh oh shake dem shake
naga ney naga ney ey
Well tell me how you feel
ah now you deal
The truth nah conceal,
look how the ghetto youth dem jugglin
so joyful inna the street

[CHORUS:]
She's a precious, precious, precious woman
Princess Black
She always, always, always say no
she tougher than an rut
She's a precious, precious, precious woman
Princess Black
She always, always, always say no
she tougher than an rut

[Edi Fitzroy:]
She don't like to stay at home, living on dependency
She say she have to strive out dey yah, just like a man you see
Anything that is progressive, she always inna that
Works and able to fight to keep her system alive

[Sizzla:]
Yea yea
This one is love forever more so reconcile
Me love them as how black woman them love them little child
Love forever more so reconcile, hail all the woman of the soil
The sick consideration of many heart,
is to pollute and currupt the black woman, ah bear fault
This fight is not for fame this fight is for a cause
