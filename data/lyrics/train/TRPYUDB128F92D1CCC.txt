You were raised up from the steam in the city
Where your daddy dragged you 'round from place to place
Now you're a grown-up, a cool guy looking pretty
But the childhood had its mark upon your face

Now you're the hungry one, you want it all
And enough is not enough, you're always coming back for more
When the race is on you roll the ball
You found your heaven behind the backstage door

You're all fed up
With their parental domination
Don't let them wear away your pride
