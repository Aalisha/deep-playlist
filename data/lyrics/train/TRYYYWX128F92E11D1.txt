For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you

I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around *** that *** Biggie and 'Pac
Like Rita Guerrero, *** took her to the top
She'll give you some brains, you let her throw up the Roc

Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some ***
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez

She was 'Eye Candy' in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far?

And all these new video *** tryin' to be Melissa Ford
But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen but behind closed doors
She'd do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards

You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up, ladies
You wouldn't get far if you kept your legs closed
It would be best to wait your turn but you know

You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you and you, for all y'all

Pop quiz, how many topless black foxes
Did I have under my belt like boxers?
Not to brag but if it add up
...
