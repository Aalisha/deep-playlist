Chorus:
Nuh real man can live without a woman
Like night to day so is a woman to her man
She's essential to his purpose and his missions
A good woman is a glory to her man
She will never take the power
She will just make him a better man
Every great man has a virtuous woman
Verse 1:
Woman yu said yu love me, you never leave me lonely
You always be there for me, so I need not worry
Woman to keep I strong which is part of Jah plan
