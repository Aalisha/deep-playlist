So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away

Long ago, I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could
But you're so far away

One more song about movin' along the highway
