I'm lying wide awake in bed
My eyes are closed just like I'm dead
My friends all think that I'm a bore
But I don't need them anymore
I don't get up I don't go out
I have no life to speak about
It feels so good to leave the blame with you
That's what I do

I'm going down
Come around
Watch me when I hit the ground
Give me just one fix of your
Your sweet american love
I go blind
Lose my mind
Leave the world I know behind
Just to feel it one last time
...
