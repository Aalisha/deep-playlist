She called herself Betty, She were black jeans and a feather in her hair like an Indian
I took the pill and slipped it underneath my tongue
You took yours and passed me the bottle

The hotel bedspread was a mess of colours, Looked like somebody had thrown-up

Betty had long hair on her forearms
And a tattoo of the Neubauten logo on the back of her right shoulder

My jaw ached from grinding my teeth
You and betty just laughed and laughed
I looked at you and you looked at her
I felt sick to my stomach
You nudged me in the ribs, caught me eye and gave me a wink
