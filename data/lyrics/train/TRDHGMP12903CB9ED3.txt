(chorus)
Too much blood shed
in the city too much blood shed
(so mi haffi go a hills go whole a mek)
too much blood shed
in a kingston city too much blood shed
(as day break anodda brodda a dead)

every my sheet a get file
every pin run dung a get oil
face nah no smile
drop it inna di wicked style
ready fi go put you unda soil
seh wah
dem a youth yah no care a dung yah
popp it off fi kill anodda
real taleban
? in the al quaeda gun
dem no miss no target dem tun weapon pon
(chorus)
Is blood shed
in the city too much blood shed
(so mi haffi go a hills go whole a mek)
