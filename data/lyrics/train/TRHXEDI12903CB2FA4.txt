Words and music by roddy frame

When days are just a trail of clothes
Slung over poetry and prose
A red reminder of the things I owe
A songbird silenced in the setting snow
I'm left here looking at the bones
I'm stranded in a sea of stepping stones
I stood inside of something I'd outgrown
A simple sadness in the great unknown
I think again and thank the earth
And kiss the stone

I saw the anger in your eyes
Neutralised
Made hollow
Faith and healing met the wide eyed child
Redemption smiled
