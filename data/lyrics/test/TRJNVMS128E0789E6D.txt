 Drawn towards these lands again
 Seeking death and sacred soil
 I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
 Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond
 Emperium
 Behold my coming
 The fullmoon rise above me
 Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow
 Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky
