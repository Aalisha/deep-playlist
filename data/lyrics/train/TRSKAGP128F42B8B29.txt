I breathe again (x3)

When you're not here minutes feel like days
And I wait to hold you in my arms
Fever breaks, my body aches
But I'm strong and I'll hold on
Open the doors feel the need in me
Come and take, come and take this pain away
Babe your love is like oxygen through my veins
And I need it

I feel my body shake and my heart's about to fail
A panic attack and I can't exhale
But baby all I need's
Your lovin' medication

Chorus:
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
When you touch me I breathe again 
You're the life I believe you're the air that I need
