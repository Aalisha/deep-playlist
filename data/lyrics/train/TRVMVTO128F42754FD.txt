[Jorn Lande]

Earthly saviour can't you see
Bleeding is the world
Our behaviour so absurd
Need something to believe in

World changer - Soul rearranger
You've left us broken hearted
Since the day we started
World changer - Don't be a stranger
Let your healing power show
We've gone too far and can't let go
