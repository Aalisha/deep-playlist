Hey! (hey)
Hey! (hey)
Hey! Hey! Hey! (Radio killer...)

(Kardinal Offishall)
Aiyyo I thought I could take her, jeans full of paper
Everything a everything but Kardi couldn't break her
Met her on a plane going straight to Jamaica
Left a vino and casino with a villa on an acre
Man a bad man with a firebrand on his sleeve
Moonlight shining on that yacky weave
Fireworks busting like you couldn't believe
Tryna get both my paws on her chest like Eve
Aiyyo they call me Mr. Kardi, apple to Bacardi
Doesn't matter while I'm trying wine ya ting up in the party
I will deal with the kids girl, beat out ya batta
Anytime any place any where, doesn't matter come on!

(Chorus: The-Dream)
Why wouldn't I (why?)
Want a body like that? (Cheah!)
My heart go (BOOM!)
Everytime you back that back (Cheah!)
And why wouldn't I (why?)
Want a body like that? (Eh!)
My them niggas go (Ehhh!)
Everytime you drop that
I just wanna feel it (oooh)
Then I wanna touch it (oooh)
Then I wanna rub it (oooh)
Hmm that ain't enough
So let me love it (ehh!)
Let me hug it (ehh!)
Do you wanna gimme some.gimme some...
