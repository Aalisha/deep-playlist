Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And a flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease

Hey man, where'd y'get that lotion?
I've been hurting since I'm up again
About something called love
Yeah, something called love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
I have a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a GTO
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan

I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
