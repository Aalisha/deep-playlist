2 million voices, can you hear 2 million voices
2 million voices, can you hear 2 million voices
2 million voices! 2 million voices shout at the street

Can you hear the cry, there's no retreat
Look at their mouths, they're open wide
Shout for an answer trying to survive

2 million voices, can you hear 2 million voices
2 million voices, can you hear 2 million voices
2 million voices!
