has it been so long
i can't remember what we last talked about
my friend, forgive me
do you think of me as i think of you
i owe my life to ...

i hold on clutching to the hope that i'll be strong
when it comes down to the wire
i'll hold on to with every ounce of strength within me
when it comes down to the wire
...
