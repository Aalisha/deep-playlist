Hours please be kind to me today
Pass by quickly let my mind drift away
But when in a lover's arms I fall
I ask that you will tick no more
'Cause these are the hours I've been waiting for
So, please, my sweet hours be kind

Hours won't you smile on me today
Hurry on by let his beauty hold my gaze
In that moment when I hear him call
I ask that you take a break from it all
For those are the hours I've been longing for
So, please, my sweet hours be kind

Is there something I can give you?
