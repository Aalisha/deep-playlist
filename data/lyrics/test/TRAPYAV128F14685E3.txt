Crossroads Lyrics

Bone, Bone, Bone,
Bone, Bone, Bone,
Bone, Bone, Bone,
So tell me what ya gonna do
When there ain't nowhere to run
When judgement comes for you
When judgement comes for you
So tell me what ya gonna do
There ain‘t no place to hide
When judgement comes for you
Cos it‘s gonna come for you

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

So why you gotta go and pray
You're gonna make it some day
You got a job
So why you want a raise
Why you wanna act tough
Why can't you play
This whole fame thing
Just comes one of these days
And when it comes
You'll be one of a kind
But before this
Keep all this in your mind
Cos I will hold you
To the end of the line
Want all this
You'll be mad to decline

So what you gonna do
When everyday's the same
Try and do this shush
Just for a glimpse of fame
Didn't mean to do it
Just put yourself to shame
Didn't want to kill her
...
