Oh, no ...
I hope the man upstairs isn't mad at me
Cuz I have one of his angels and she's here with me
Each time I see her precious smile and she spreads her wings
It takes me to a place where love meets eternity
(Oh no) Oh no (I'm not letting go) letting go
I don't want to be alone in this crazy world
(Oh Lord) Oh Lord (I love her so) I love her so
And I'll sacrifice it all to have her in my life

(Chorus)
I found my girl, I'll tell the world
That heaven is missing an angel
(Missing an angel)
My dreams came true (came true, came true)
When I found you
