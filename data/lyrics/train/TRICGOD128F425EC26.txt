Remember those photographs we took on that boat in Spain
I took 'em down and ripped 'em up and threw them all away
Remember on the back of one you wrote we were meant to be
That doesn't really matter now 'cause you don't mean a thing to me

Baby, you should've told me
Told me from the start
I thought that I was your only
Till you put me on the shelf and found somebody else

I never thought that you would ever do that
Everything we had is gone
You said you love me, said you'll never leave
Maybe I just heard you wrong

'Cause I'm damaged, I'm damaged
Don't know what to do
Baby, I'm damaged, so, so damaged
Because of you

Got rid of those clothes you left
Like you got rid of my dreams
I don't wanna be reminded of
All of the memories
