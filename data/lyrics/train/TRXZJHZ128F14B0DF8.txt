My position, occupation facin' dirt earth check my worth 
While cleanin' Johnny, on the spots for some spendin' cash 
So I can buy my girl some flowers at last while I fast and learn the past 
Yet I'm still sacrificin nothin' in America wearin' a new pair of Nike Cortez 
Eatin' anything I want in my fridge 
So listen to the words that my mother says 
This is the land of the free and home of the brats 
Just like me, but I don't wanna be like that 
You can't control even a second of your soul 
Cause what you think is yours you need to let go 
I know but I keep fightin' this flesh 
Even though I know I put it to death 
It continues to rise, like the wicked man's lies 
You can't control us now 
And you can't hold us down 
Cause we seek the Truth 
And a burden that's light 
Chorus: Oh yes, yes 
We know, we know 
The One who's in control 
Oh yes, yes 
We know, we know 
...
