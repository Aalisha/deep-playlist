Long, long ago, in the years BC
The women used to gossip while they made their tea
It's been our method of survival, right from the start
But girl, you've really gone and turned it into an art

After I see you I feel dirty as hell
Like you've contaminated me with that peculiar smell
That comes from dishing up the dirt on all your closest friends
I mean like what the hell is with her, I mean, have no offense

So please, don't take it to heart
When I say can we start to spend time apart
But frankly my dear, this friendship is toxic
Like a fox and a hound

I like you, I like you, I like you better
I like you better when you're not around
I like you, I like you, I like you better
