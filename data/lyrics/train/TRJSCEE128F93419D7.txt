What can you do with a girl like that?
Taking everything giving nothing back
Stuck between her legs when she sets her trap
What can you do with a girl like that?

She's knows what she's doing
Standing there with her headphones in
Skinny jeans and a tattoo
Her smile makes me wonder where she's been

I would make a move
if I thought there was a chance she'd let me in

What can you do with a girl like that?
Taking everything giving nothing back
Stuck between her legs when she sets her trap
What can you do with a girl like that?

I can't wait for the weekend
Downtown where we all sneak in
Everybody's trying to get some
