LOVERS WHO WANDER
 Dion
 
 When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
 And I knew right away I was born to cry
 Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
 Cause I found that place for lover's who wander
 
 She took my love, said she's not comin back
 So my world and my sky was all turnin black
 Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
 Cause I found that place for lovers who wander
 
 A walkin around thinkin about her
