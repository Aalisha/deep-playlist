[Intro: samples Capleton's "Danger Zone"]
We at war (gyeah) [3X]
We at war
"Livin in the danger zone, in the battlefield"
"Dem who kyan't hear dem a go feel!"

Yeah, rude boy stand up, man up, chest out
Get the cannon, time to pull that steel plate vest out
We don't play around, cock back, gun 'em down
Chase 'em all around town, you hear that sound ("WHO DAT?")
Uhh, straight yardie
Me and the notty head, inside the party
Outside the shotty, inside the ganja
and a big ass fonta, music all loud
Somebody tell the DJ ("WHO DAT?")
It's a danger zone (danger zone) you got police
If not police you got some batty bwoy, schemin on your piece
We street runnin, big whips we crash it up
Hit the block and mash it up, we in the danger zone
("WHO DAT?") Let's go

[Chorus: samples Capleton's "Danger Zone"]
We at war (gyeah) [3X]
