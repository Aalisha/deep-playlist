Stagecoach lady, hourglass body
Makin' thing's glow in the night
Well, she would if she could
And she'd be good if she would
Only tell her lover, she be out tonight

'Cause I'm a bad
A lonely school boy
And I'm a rat
And it's too bad
Can't get me none of that

Salt Lake City, salt lickin' bitties
Bogies turn, stinkin' of gin
Well, my daddy was hard
His face was pretty scarred
From kickin' ass to playin' poker to win
