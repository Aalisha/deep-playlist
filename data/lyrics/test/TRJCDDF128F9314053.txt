Would have done more than anything
Back then to make you smile (oohh)
To the end of the earth and back
To protect all that we had

Now it's done (now it's done)
And I'm gone (I'm gone)
But you're back here in my face

So why you wanna go kickstart the drama
Now don't you know you can't
Break through my armor
Just leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
just leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone) oooh
Kickstart the drama, oooh
Kickstart the drama

It's a little too late to want me now
