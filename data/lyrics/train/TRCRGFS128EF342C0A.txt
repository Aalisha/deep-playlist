Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it
If he'd been here now? Holy cow
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars

'Cause I don't have foresight to see
If we still be together in the twenty first
In the twenty first century [Incomprehensible]

He's our flyin' ace, pilot of the future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size

'Cause I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny, oh no

So long Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye restless night
