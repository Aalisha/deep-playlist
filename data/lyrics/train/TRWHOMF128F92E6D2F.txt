Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Everything comes falling
Like leaves fall from a trees
Natural progression
Everything comes falling
Like rain falls when gods
Cry for our salvation

Ride through endless sin
To the mountains of despair
Break through all the
Things you couldn't do
Suffer inside
Every day living a lie
Cleansed by those feelings
You try to deny

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Everything comes falling
Like tears flows from the soul
