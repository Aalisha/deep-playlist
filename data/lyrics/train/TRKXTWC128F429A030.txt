Do you wanna come dancing, honey?
Come take the chance of love
Oh, don't do it too hot to stop it
Come, call me Dr. Love

Love is a dangerous game
Oh, gimme, gimme what I need tonight
Come in my arms again
Baby, my love is deep inside
Deep inside

I'll give you everything I own
I'll give my love, my heart, my home
I'm tossing and turning, my heart is burning
The rest of my life
