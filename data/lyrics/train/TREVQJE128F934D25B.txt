Orphan boys and girls end up
In church rules Institutions
To be brought up a Christian way
You better have no illusions

During the day, there's pain and hope
A better life to lead
But come the night the nightmare start
There's lust priests need to feed

There're secret rooms and secret doors
The kids to bring inside
Strip down your clothes, be quick, don't cry
There's no need to be shy

We'll touch your skin, we'll put our hands
Where you don't want them to be
You'll suck our dicks, we'll rip your ass
And God will bless the deed

Do you feel pain? Good, that's just fine
No one will hear your screams
Just let it go, give up, you'll see
We'll haunt you in your dreams
