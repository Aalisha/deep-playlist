I've been on my own all day (day)
With al green and marvin gaye (gaye)
Waiting for rewind to play (play)
I'm anticipating
Mood swings, al sings once more
Everything is changing
You've played mind games before

I thought there'd be fireworks
I expected changes (changes)
I thought there'd be trumpets
Sweetest soul sensations

I've been on my own all day (day)
Nothing seems to be okay (okay)
Blue-eyed soul has turned to grey (grey)
