Cherry picking through the stars
And falling cannonballs
Waiting for the break of dawn
To start its morning crawl
Polluted rays of filtered light
Tropical and warm
Making shadows through
The snow white resin covered skulls

Happy birthday to the war

Standing by the wall
A rainbow made of stars
Under seven difference shades of grey
Spreading out across the arc
Days of wonder spent
Out there killing time
Now this may not leave a mark on me
But I sure as hell was there
...
