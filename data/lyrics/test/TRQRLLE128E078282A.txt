I fell asleep in the silence
Before the street fights the fire

Free in the world that you've given
Lay in the sound
The water still calls
Still calls

Afraid of the dark that surrounds me
Hide in the dirt of the ground
Free in the wind that surrounds me
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night
Not afraid
...
