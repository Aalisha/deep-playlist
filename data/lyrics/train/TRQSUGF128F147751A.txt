I've been making moves in chains
wrapped around my hollow heart
the thought of you remains
I can't replace your face no matter how I try
and in the night I cry from wanting you
you know I thought I could not lose
America was calling me
you said I must choose
between a life of love or visions that will fade
and now the choice is made I'm so lonely

Can you feel me
reaching out to you
I'm so lonely
are you lonely too
I would give anything
to make you understand
that I would go anywhere
to be with you again

Heaven help me if you can
I remember better days
but now I understand
you can't buy happiness, love is not for sale
...
