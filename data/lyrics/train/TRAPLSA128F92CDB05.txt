I've shed alot of years and tears
In this broke down used up town
Bled my heart on these city streets
As strangers lay their money down
I'm home

I've never known a love
My soul was searching for
Now I look into that great big blue
Feel nothing I've felt before
I'm alone

So I'll shake some hands
Chase that calling star
I'm gonna drive so fast
I can only drive so far
Gonna lay my bricks
...
