If you want to make me happy, stay.
If you want to make me laugh like a little boy, come play.
If you want to break my heart, just go away.

Learn how to disappear
Get yourself away from here
Change your name and your address
And get a brand new face
Erase the memories from your head
Act like someone else instead
Disappear and leave a giant question in your place
