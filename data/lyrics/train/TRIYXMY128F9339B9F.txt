God made the automobile to pass all the pretty girls
That smoke by the side of the road, their blues loving boys in tow
To drive until the end of the day and bow to a borrowed flag
Beside all the brave and the blind, and men without men in mind

To pass all the things he made
But then never bothered to name
And no one will tell the truth
