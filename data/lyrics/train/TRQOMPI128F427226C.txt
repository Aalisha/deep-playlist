I couldn't stop movin' when I first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a band called "Jokers", they were layin' it down
Doncha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Lawdy mama, light my fuse
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
Truck on out and spread the news, alright

I hope y'all know what I'm talkin' about
The way she wiggled that thing, it really knocks me out
Gettin' high all the time but if you're not there too
