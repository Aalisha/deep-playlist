If I ever feel the light again shinin' down on me
I don't have to tell you what a welcome it will be
I felt the light before but I let it slip away
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day

[Chorus]
It's not the spotlight
And it's not the camera light
And it's not the streetlight of some old street of dreams
It ain't the moonlight
