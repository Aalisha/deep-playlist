Yeah nigga fuckin' back hunger for more
Tony's home yo Banks I told these niggas man
Y'all done fucked up now
Here we go

Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from this is

We gettin' doe everywhere we go
And it's killin' 'em slow just to hear me blow
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
If you ain't reppin' where you from sit down

By now I know you done seen me
On your stadium or TV with three eighty on the E.V
I skeet babies on your breezy and I ain't stoppin'
Only Jake the Jacob could freeze me

Leaves me and it's bye, bye gone
We got guns like Popeye arms
I put a ring on their finger but the rats still askin'
'Coz there's one in all they mind I'm the Rap Phil Jackson and

I built a rep for murderin' every Whoo Kid
Kayslay and Big Mike admit it the kid tight
And you ain't even put up a fight
So it's back to da amatures wrapped in ya sandwiches

I'm hot now so the rats wanna stand with us
They hop in the van with us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs now I'm back tourin' Canadas
Amongst weed smokers and crap floor gamblers

Ain't no click like the one I'm with
If the drama gets thick it's the guns I get
G unit niggas is runnin' this shit
