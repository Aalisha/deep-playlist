Edna million in a drop dead suit
Dutch pink on a downtown train
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner on the pouring rain
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest

I'm full of bourbon and i can't stand up

Your house is on fire, your children alone
Hey little bird, you fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children alone

Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head
