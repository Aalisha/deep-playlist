The very concept of leadership implies everything I once was, everything that you hoped I would be.
Masqueraded.
Down on my knees I watched you kill me.
Let’s play the victim, game is murder.
I’ll take out the gun, you take out the witness.
Every time I fought back, every time that you left me behind.
Mutilated.
You killed my soul, you stole my insides.
I played the game called murder.
I’ll take the gun, you take the witness.
Goodbye.
Tonight I’m leaving you behind.
