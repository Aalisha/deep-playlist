So you're losing tonight
Nothing seems to go right
You keep playing the wrong cards, don't you?
Someone's throwing the dice
And you need some advice
So you listen to me now, won't you?
You don't know what's at stake
That your heart's gonna break
If you don't watch yourself tonight

The Queen of Hearts is back in town
The Queen of Hearts still wears the crown
She does not intend to abdicate
She'll be playing it cool
She'll make you feel like a fool
And you will never know if she will play it straight
