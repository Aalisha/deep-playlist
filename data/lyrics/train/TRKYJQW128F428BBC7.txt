Don't lie to me
Even if it's gonna make me cry
Say what you mean
Even if it hurts me deep inside
We've been good friends for years and I hold that dear
But you cannot end this night
Without giving me a chance to tell ya
How I feel inside

So you're seeing her
What's this the, third or second date?
Is it serious?
If it is your making a big mistake
Can you be truthful when
Your alone with her and look into her eyes
If you tell me that you don't think of me
It would come as a surprise

Can you tell me that I'm not her
Say I'm not the one who completes your world
Who should share your name, who should wear your ring
When I've always been your girl
