I always thought that a man should be the boss in his home.
But how can a king rule his castle when he's always gone
(now listen)
I tried to do the things for you that a woman should do
But you take me for granted baby,
You must think I'm some kind of fool

But here's some food for thought
And I want you to understand
I can love you like a woman,
But oh! also fight you like a man
(did you hear what I said?)
It's allright

You rush out, and take your time coming in
Thats how its always been
You been treating me like I'm a piece of wood
