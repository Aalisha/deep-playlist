Na na na na, na na na na
I'm loving you
Na na na na, na na na na

Because loving you
Boy you broke my heart in two
And there's nothing i can do

Without you i'm loving you
Reach out to me lover
And try and tell me what is wrong

We love one another
It's to you i do belong

Just trust in me baby
We've been together far so long
