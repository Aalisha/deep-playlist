Oh, kiss me
Lick your cigarette, then kiss me
Kiss me where your eye won't meet me
Meet me where your mind won't kiss me

Lick your eyes and mine and then hit me
Hit me with your eyes so sweetly
Oh, you know you know you know that yes I love
I mean I'd love to get to know you

Do you never wonder?
No, no no no

You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
You girls never know
Oh no, you girls'll never know
No you girls never know
How you make a boy feel
How you make a boy
