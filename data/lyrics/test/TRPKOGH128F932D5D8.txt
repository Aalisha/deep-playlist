I cashed in all my chips tonight
combed my hair to look just right
'Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl
And we've got something going on
You told me you can't wait to see me
But you didn't bother to even show up
This whole situation is incredibly typical
I should have seen it all along
(I should have seen it all along)
I should have seen it all along

It's girls like you that make me think I'm better off...
Home on a Saturday night
With all my doors locked up tight
I won't be thinking about you... baby

You called me on the phone
But you don't even wanna talk
You're staring at me from across the room
...
