Cracking up, I'm getting ready to go
Had enough, I can't take any more
No pills that I can take
This is too real and there ain't no escape

It scare the daylights
It make a nightmare
I'm tense and I'm nervous
Everybody all around me
Shakin' hands and sayin' howdie

I don't think it's funny no more

Cracking up, Like a worn out shoe
Ain't wet, but the world leakin' through
...
