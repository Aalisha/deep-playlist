You smacked her right between her blue eyes
You didn't think ahead, yeah that was what he said
Then everyone of us just turned our backs to him and said
That was not a nice thing to do yeah
I can't believe that he was so cruel

But you love your brother
No matter what they say
Yeah you love your brothers
No matter what kind of games you play

And it's gonna rain that's what they say
And we're just gonna cover our heads
