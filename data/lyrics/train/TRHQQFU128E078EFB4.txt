1stDear God
It´s me again...
I am so far from where I could have been
Dear God, I would be incomplete
But u came and touched my life in time of need

So I´m thanking you for all you´ve done
And for sacrificing your only son
That´s why I´m writing this letter

To let you know that I love you

Thank you for all that I am
And for being a friend
Lord, my love for you´ll never end
2ndDear God
It´s Shawn this time...
