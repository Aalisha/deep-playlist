It's a struggle with a failures frown
And it crashes in front of me
I see the clouds divide
Will you stay or try to leave

The time you're looking at the door
And think to walk right through
I want to ignore
I only wish that it passes soon

Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
