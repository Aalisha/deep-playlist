I won't go, I won't stay
'Til you give me a taste
I wanna feel like that

Now I shake, and you sweat
And we'll dance, no let's sing
'Cause now I feel like that

Oh, tell me do you like that? (I think I like that)
Maybe we can stop this (I wish we never started)

Tell me what to do
I wanna feel okay

I got a problem and it drains my soul
