You thought that you would break us
You'll never beat us down
As long as blood runs through these veins
You'll never wear the crown

I'm sorry that I hate you
I tried and tried again
Everytime we take you back
You fuck us once again

All the times we've suffered
Years and years of pain
A contract we gave with our blood
...
