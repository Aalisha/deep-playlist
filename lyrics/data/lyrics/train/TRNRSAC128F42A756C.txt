You and me, we're gonna escape tonight
On the run under the moonlight
Don't think about nothin'
No, don't think about nothin'

Tragedy, runnin' the red light
Hear the screams, another one dies tonight
Don't think about nothin'
Don't think about nothin'

Do you know how it feels to be wanted?
Do you know how it feels to be wanted?
Do you know how it feels, to be under the gun
On the run, having fun, when you're young
You're so young, when you're young, yeah

Public enemy #1
(Oh yeah)
I'm public enemy #1
(Oh yeah)
I'm public enemy #1
(Oh yeah)

Coming home, fast as the speed of sound
Loser's dreams, crashing to the ground
Don't think about nothin'
No, don't think about nothin'
...
