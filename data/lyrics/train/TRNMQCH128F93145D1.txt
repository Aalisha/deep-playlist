Yeah yeah yeah I’m still about (TEMPZ!!!)
Don’t watch the hype (MAD! NEXT HYPE!)
This is for my fans dem you get me (NEXT HYPER TUNE!)
Mans still spittin its a ting you get me…

What kind of things that you have
When I find out don’t expect me to stop
I’ll come for the P’s that you stack
And come for all the food that blot
Better hand over the bag
Your boys don’t wanna see you shot
If I kick down the door to your flat
Dun Know I’ll clear out your house on the spot

(CLEAR!) All the things in your house
(CLEAR!) All the things in your fridge
(SMASH!) All your plates from your rack
(CLEAR!) All’a your kids’ toys
(CLEAR!) All’a your CD rack
Won’t get none of your CD’s back
Drag off your curtain rail from the wall
Kick off your HDTV from the stand

Run up on stairs in to rooms
Flip the mattress and search for the cash
