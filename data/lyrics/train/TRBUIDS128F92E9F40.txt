I’m falling, I’m falling, falling in love with you. 
Baby, come closer, closer to me, 
and listen, listen carefully. 
Remember all the nights that I told you I loved you. 
It wasn’t true, I used you, 
and you were just someone new 
to thrill this lonely heart of mine. 
I was lying all the time 
pretending to be falling in love with you. 
But it’s different now. 
I’ve kissed you now, so forgive me, forgive me somehow.
