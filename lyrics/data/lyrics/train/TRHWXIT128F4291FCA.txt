The book of life 
The book of life
Sip the water from the brook of life
Nuff got animal inna dem pot 
bout dem a cook a spice
Youts what you say or do
Should be tru 
truwoow woooo wo wooo
truwoow woooo wo wooo

With a nasty scorn 
The wicked look at life
Dem got ice pick and knife
and a stab anna juk at life
Dem all a dash dem web
Dem net dem hook at life
Dem seh dem want dem wing 
to go to heaven to look for christ
While dem a bow down anno worship dem images
Iwayne keep yodding life pilgrimage 
Tafari never wrong nor fall
So still him is highly give
Life privilage in all the villages to live
To life give praises
For these infinite Stages
I naah Stoop fi noh wages
Bun Babylon slave Biz
Dem Separate man and woman
And lock dem inna cages
dem seh more sodomy so less babies
dem seh more birth control and abortion for the ladies
for ages
the book of life pages

Babylon waah smear and tear off
Bun dem sodomy affair up 
Slew dem from far with the spear
No need to be near
Life eye sights are Crystal clear
you hear
Trees bear for the children to share
