We've got a good thing going on...
We've got a good thing going on...
B-b-baby
Wanting you so bad is a problem i have
And i know that you need me
But you won't come that easy
I said, i know, i know, whoa

C'mon baby, you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from my chest
My heart's on fire
I'm falling from your lips
You know, you know
We've got a good,
Good thing going on

We've got a good thing going on
Whisper to me softly
Let your hands do the talking
...
