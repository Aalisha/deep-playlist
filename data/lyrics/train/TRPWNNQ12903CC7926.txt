Smokey bar
Mediocre band playin'
Old familiar songs
Hit after hit

Neon lights
Cuttin' through the smoke
A new Minnesota fats
Is chalkin' up his stick

Nine ball in the corner pocket
Twenty dollars gone
Two bubba's standin' toe to toe
About to get it on

That'll make you wanna drink
Say 'What the heck'
Turn up a cold one
Throw down your paycheck

A room full of good times
...
