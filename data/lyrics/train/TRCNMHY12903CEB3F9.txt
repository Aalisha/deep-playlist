When our masterpiece is complete
And the coroner's report is back in
It will read, "The cause of death: art"

Art
It will read, "The cause of death: art"

Art

Your death scene projected on the ceiling
What's in your veins will express the way I'm feeling
A melting image of the holes in your head
Bleeding from the walls that we painted red in the dark

Only when you're hurting
Will you know what you are
Only if we end it together, forever
Can you take it that far?
