Don't you even try to jettison now
This has gone, this has gone as far as i can allow
This ships been sinking with you at the helm
Straight to hell, straight to hell, take a bow straight to hell
The waters red now bring in the sharks
Circling, circling look who's calling the shots
Find a new hit or a brand new drug to get off, to get off, to get off

New York City
You weren't good to me
You held me close and set me free
Big city you made me disappear

I'm addicted to the chances i take
Bigger stakes, bigger stakes makes the pendulum shake
There are no issues with the hands that I've held
...
