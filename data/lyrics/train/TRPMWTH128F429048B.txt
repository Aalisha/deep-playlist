Got tired of living in that one horse town
I went to the station to flag that Hummingbird down
I didn't even call to say good-bye
I couldn't stand to see that little girl cry

Now I'm off to the city, gonna make my name
Those lights are calling me to fortune and fame

I had to ride that Hummingbird
I had to ride that Hummingbird
