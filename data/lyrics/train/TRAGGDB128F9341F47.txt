I remember when we met, 
Before I was invisible.
I thought I'd play it hard to get,
Pretend I'm unapproachable.
But somebody else came along and
Took all the chances that I missed.
Stuck on the sideline I keep thinking 'there she goes'...

Falling like rain...
No, I don't get to hold her tonight.
Falling like rain...
I was pushed to the back of the line.
'Cause even though I need her love and crave her touch,
I guess I wasn't fast enough.
She's falling like rain,
Just not for me.
Not for me, no, no...

Why I took the longest road
I'll have to plead insanity.
It's like my pride put on a show
...
