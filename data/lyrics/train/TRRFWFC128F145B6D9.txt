I'm (do-do) the one (do-do) who really lo-o-o-o-oves you
I'm (do-do) the one (do-do) who really lo-oves you, yeah-eah

You know that I would wait fore-ever
And I would never tie you down
At night, a date you feel like ca-a-alling, I'd come arou-ound

Down in the street, look in the hou-ouses
People everywhere are havin' fun
When it comes to you I'm only wai-aiting
To say that you're the o-one

I'm the one who said she really lo-oved you
And I would never fool around
I'm the one who said she really lo-oved you
And I'd never let you dow-ow-own, oh...
I'm the one who really loves you-ou
...
