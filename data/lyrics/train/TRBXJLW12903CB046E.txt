Take away everything i never had we'd all be the same
you live for lust, lust for greed to die in vain
just like they did what you know about life anyway
have you ever seen the hunger feed away
all i have its all i care its all i need
the world would take a life for a dime it didnt need
i'll never give up on you and everything we've been through
