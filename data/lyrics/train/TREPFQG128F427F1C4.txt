On the outside, You think I'm alright
There's a smile on my face, everything's okay
But on the inside there's a different story
I've stumbled down this road and I've got so far to go

I'm a broken man
On my knees again
Longing for a touch from You
I need your hand to

Restore me, I need Your mercy
Take me to the place I used to be
Use all the pain and the hurt
...
