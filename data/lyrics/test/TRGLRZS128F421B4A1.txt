Why - why do we turn away
When they shout that hymn
Marching so brave
Their hearts beat on boldly right
Their souls belong to those of the weak

Walking so blinded
Surrounded by brown coated lies
Hear propaganda which says
Bleed for the master race

We're not under the same nation
The past has gone - don't fear the new
It's your only chance - your only salvation

Why should we be blond and blue-eyed
