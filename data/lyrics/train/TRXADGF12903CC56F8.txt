It starts with almost nothing,
But then you feel the fire.
It builds from just a feeling,
But then your need turns dire.

You don't know where it came from,
And you thought you wouldn't dare.
You don't know what will happen,
And you don't know if you care.

Do you see the confusion?
Where do you think this will lead?
Do you feel the commotion?
Why do you feel so much need?
