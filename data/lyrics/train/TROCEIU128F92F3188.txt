Things are not always what they appear to be
Beneath the calm exterior
There can be a soul on fire

Truth is not always what the eyes can see
The smile upon our faces
Can disguise our pain and hide the traces


*Sometimes the rock that we depend on
Melts into the ground and disappears
The one thing you thought was forever
Slowly washed away by all the tears
