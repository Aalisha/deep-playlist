Why get up, why get up
How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
