'Cos I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me every time I need it
Ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me more, and more

Don't wanna lose this feelin'
That you're givin' me every time I need it
I ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me, more
(give me more)

I'm back for more and I got the cure
I know where I'm going for sure
What we threw away, we should be saved
Come and make my day
...
