Show show show show, show show show show
Show show show show, show show show
Showin' out, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out

Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out, showin' out

You'd better live in love than luxury, it's alright
And don't be dining out on foolish dreams every night

O-o-only takes a moment to feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
