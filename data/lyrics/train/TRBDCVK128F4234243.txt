I see you staring out from the printed page
The calm before the storm in your breath
The sunset on the side of your face
The moments between life and death

One truth for the men who pushed you into death
And one truth for the rest of us
We may be down, but not out
We're standing right in back of you

Static quotations, historical lies
Don't mean nothing when your children die
Just one more breath, the last word on your lips
...
