I live knowing that we're slaves to be sold
And my paranoia is a joke, so I'm told
And where's the new Jesus? Well, he's off praising the Lord
The Yankee clinches the commie with his tight umbilical cord

And they train you to never, ever grow old

So wake up and uncuff your hands
Now wake up, your future has been planned
To play God you must round up your lambs
Now wake up and uncuff your hands
