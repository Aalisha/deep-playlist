Say goodnight and go

Skipping beats, blushing cheeks
I am struggling
Daydreaming bed scenes in
The corner cafe
And then I'm left in bits
Recovering, tectonic trembling
You get me every time

Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Follow you home
You've got your headphones on
