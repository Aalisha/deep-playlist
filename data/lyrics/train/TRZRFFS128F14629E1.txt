There are 8 million stories in the naked city

8 million stories, 8 million stories
8 million stories, 8 million stories

There are 8 million stories in the naked city
Some ice cold and told without pity
About the mean streets and the ghetto culture
The pimps, the pushers the sharks and vultures

Things that happen when it reaches dark
And all the things you hear about Central Park
You got to be down, you got to have strength
If you're gonna survive past 110th

Well, it ain't no thing when blood is spilled
The emergency ward is capacity filled
And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise
And the naked city never closes its eyes

A new story for every day
Told a thousand different ways
That's how it is and that's how it goes
The city with the 8 and six big O's

New York, you know this is a crazy city, man
Word, skyscrapers, everything
And you just never know who you might meet in this town
Yo, dig on my home boys Run DMC

A young girl seemed to be gaining weight
Her parents all thought it was the food she ate
Their attitudes were all la de da de
But little did they know there's a baby in the body

She tried to hide it but they'll soon know
Because sooner or later that baby's got to show
Can her Daddy just accept that as a fact
That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack?

Then there's another girl, her name is Vicki
