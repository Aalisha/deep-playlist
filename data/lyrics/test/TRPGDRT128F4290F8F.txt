Cry your eyes bloodshot
While there's still time
'Cause soon-
It's gone,
And you'll be so shocked!

One queen-sized coffin
That was built for two
Is your death bed
It belongs to you

Tease me baby,
Please me
With the fresh disease
Hope riding on a bullet
Alive tonight,
You know we couldn't get it-
Right!

Come save your life tonight
You know we'll never get it-
...
