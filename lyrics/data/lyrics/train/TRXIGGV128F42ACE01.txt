Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I've never known what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to break me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like a one half could
It's wanting more it's gonna set me to my knees

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
...
