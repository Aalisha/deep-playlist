does he hold you like i hold you
will he ever bow down and die
(oh yes he will)
does he hold on like i hold on
will he ever bow down and die

and i dont care what the world say about her
if i hold out my hand then you'll know ill be there
if i hold out my hand then you'll know ill be there
(oh yes i will)

and i dont care what the world say about her
if i hold out my hand then you'll know ill be there
if i hold out my hand then you'll know ill be there
(oh yes i will)

does he hold you like i hold you
