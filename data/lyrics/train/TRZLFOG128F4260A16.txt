We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shawty I could take you there

Or we can go to the slums
Where killas get hung
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya (I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya...)
I could take ya(I could take ya...)
Shawty I could take you there
Baby girl I know it's rough but come with me
We can take a trip to the hood
It's no problem girl it's my city

I could take you there

Little kid wit guns only 15
Roam in the streets up to no good
When gun shots just watch us, run quickly
I could show you where
As long as you're with me
Baby you'll be alright

I'm known in the ghetto
Girl just stay by my side

Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Baby it's up to you
It's whatever you like

We can go to the tropics
