Oh Heather honey
Warm as the sunshine
Oh Heather honey
Your love is so fine

I've been here, I've been there
I've been around
and I fell in and out of love
In most every town
But the girls I knew were not like you
You're a different kind
Heather honey, now can't you see
You're blowing my mind

Oh Heather honey
