Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told, with all my heart and soul how I adore you
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.
This heart would break in two if you refuse me
I'm no good without you anyhow
Dear have I told you lately that I love you
Well darlin' I'm tellin' you now.
