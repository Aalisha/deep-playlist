On the floor, the people dance around
Moving close together
But there over low, in the corner
There's the girl I once knew
Who broke me in two

So won't you please play a song?
A sentimental song
For my sentimental friend over there
We've been so long apart
Make it go right to the heart
Of my sentimental friend over there

Bring the tears to her eyes
Help to make her realize
The love we had was just beyond compare
And if the time is right
Maybe I'll hold her tight
My sentimental friend over there
...
