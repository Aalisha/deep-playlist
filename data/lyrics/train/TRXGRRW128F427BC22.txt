Arose from the second triangle burning my soul
Gehenna is the place for burning, takes me away
Order of the golden dawn summoning Beelzebub
Give your eternal loyalty demon of death and evil

God is dead and always has been
Be your god and devoutly worship yourself
To thee we confess... Shut up and hold your tongue
Justify your beliefs and forsee reality

I am the personification of cosmic force
And the creator of all living things
Even the gods bow at my feet
To lick the blood from my sword
...
