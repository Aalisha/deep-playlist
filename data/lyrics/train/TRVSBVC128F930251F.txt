Too Much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure

Too much pressure, this pressure got to stop
Too much pressure, it's getting to my head
Too much pressure, they're giving me hard times
Too much pressure, my man made me sad
Too much pressure, him try to make me look small
Too much pressure, end up with no money
Too much pressure, my car fail its MOT
Too much pressure, I said my car fail its MOT

Too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure, too much pressure
