There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me

I've never been the kinda man
To let a woman change my plan
But all of that was history
When she sho 'nuff did this to me
Her lies they won me over quick
She ruled my mind, my heart, my dick
I took the line, the hook, the bait
And now I'm sick from what I ate

There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
Her mission is my misery
Poor ol' broken hearted me
...
