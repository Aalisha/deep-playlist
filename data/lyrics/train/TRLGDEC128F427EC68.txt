Where the crane flies through the marshes
And the turtles sun their shells
Where the water rat goes swimmin'
That's where my swamp girl dwells

Where the sunlight never wanders
And the moonlight never falls
Where the water's black with the devil's track
That's where my swamp girl calls

What did she say there
The girl with the golden hair
To make me follow her down there
How did she look when she took me by the hand

Tonight her hair will float in the water
And the gold will no longer shine
It will spread like a fan in the water
While she makes a mysterious sign
