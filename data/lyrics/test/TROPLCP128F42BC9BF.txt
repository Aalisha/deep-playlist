You see me on TV, different videos
Here I got a new chick every week, I know
Don't use that to judge me, come and get to know me
Hopefully, I can show you just what I'm all about

You never know what you might be missin'
Gimme a go, yes, I'll beat your interest
This is a show you won't be disappointed
Here's your invitation, come on over right now

Have you ever been with a star?
Everywhere you go everybody knows ya
Have you ever been with a star?
24/7 red carpet, lies, girl, stop it

Have you ever been with a star?
Addicted, chew it, sex, not that chick, girl
It's obvious to see where you should be
With me, have you ever been with a star?
