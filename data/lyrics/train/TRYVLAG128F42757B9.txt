You got the smile of a Monalisa,
Know it all an' giving nothing away.
You make the sins of a vestal virgin,
Look nothing more that a roll in the hay.

So lie down, I think I love you,
Lie down, I think I care.
Lie down, I think I love you,
Lie down, I think I care.

You give an air of the Dolce Vita,
Society's made a queen out of you.
Casanova couldn't take all your virtue,
But, rock 'n' roll is gonna steal it from you.
