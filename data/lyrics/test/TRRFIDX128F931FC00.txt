I will hate clubs, also small talk and drugs
Mainly exist as a shut in
You will drag bars with unknown moods
Till you see the sun come up all of a sudden
Yeah, but we got one thing in common
Though we might think better of it
We won't settle down
Till our heads are wrecked
We'll toss around toss around
I'll lie in bed with wondering and dread 
And then take a drive somewhere
You'll do cocaine, stumble out of taxis
And end up with smoke in your hair
Yeah, but look at this
Though we might really need to
We won't settle down
