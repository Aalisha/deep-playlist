oh how sweet that the thoughts and dreams are free
my emotions flying high, imagination running wild
just the thought of you makes me giggle like a little fool
how I wish that you were near to quickly get me out of here

won`t you save me, set me free, unbreak me
save me, get me out of here and take me home
cogita rationabilis, carpe vitam honorabilis
save me, set me free, unbreak me
...
