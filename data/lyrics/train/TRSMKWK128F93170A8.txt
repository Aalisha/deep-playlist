Your eyes are like deep wells of desire
Once in your arms I'm on fire
You were sent girl so perfectly true
Changing my life
Now I'm a survivor

Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you

Late at night when the evening fire has died
There's a look in your eye
Seductive images fly

Heaven sent
