I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around, so uncomfortable is how it feels
Every time you're near
Trouble disappears under the ground

But when you go to far, silver clouds will start hanging around
And I know why
Try to run, but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle, and I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh oh oh
Try to once so I keep on

Coming back
Full circle 'cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
...
