I never knew my father
I never knew his pain
Or that an empty home life
Would break him down again
So when I feel like running
I have to look inside
I wanna find the answers
I wanna break my line

Fear falls down like rain
And it makes me whole again
Fear falls like rain

Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life
Are not tokens
I wanna let you know
That I'm still learning
...
