There's a town, just a little town
Raining cloud, a hollow sound
When our lover gather round
And if they're cold
Then they're cold
Feed them wine, feed them chrome
We hate this place here
It's our home, It's our home

And your car-collapsing trees and I
Could turn them back to sound
With the torches in our hands we will reduce it
...
