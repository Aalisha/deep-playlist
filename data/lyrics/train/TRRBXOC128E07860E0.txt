[verse 1]
Ayyo, dude's mad, (what? ) been in this game for a while (bitch)
I been, mindin my business sellin cane for a while (that's what happened? )
I can freestyle, but I ain't do it for for a while (wow)
Hate dude, slime been hatin for a while (oh no no)
Shit, coups, sedans, trucks, and drops for a while (you ballin)
But meanwhile, I been good for a while (what happened? )
Just left the hood, was in the hood for a while (you are the man)
Been fuckin these bitches, gettin pussy for a while (boy, watch ya back)
Boy, watch ya mouth, you been cursin for a while (yeah)
It's a big show, you been rehearsin for a while
Smash records, they makin hits for a while (that's true)
Used to be, hand-in-hand in the hood for a while (that's true too)
