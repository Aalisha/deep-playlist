Heaven, so fine
Heaven, it's quite a climb

From seven stories underground
Black mistress gonna crack that whip
When I sleep I'm never found
But my baby she don't take no lip

My Cinderella carryin' me
And my shot blood through the afterglow
Ah, slap me to my knees
Which direction baby I don't know

Oh, Heaven, it's quite a climb
...
