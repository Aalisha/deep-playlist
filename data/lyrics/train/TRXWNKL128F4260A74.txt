Intro:

I go downtown and roam around but every street I walk I find another
dead end
I'm on my own but I'm so all alone, I need somebody so I won't have to
pretend
I know that someone's just waiting somewhere
I look around for her but she's just not there, oh!

CHORUS:
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
