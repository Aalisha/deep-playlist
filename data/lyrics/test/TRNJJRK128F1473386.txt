Did you stop to think, when we moved by the sea?
When the seasons changed.
(When the seasons changed),
They changed for a reason,
I'm not talking lightly, I don't need to set the scene.
We're living in it.
(We're living in it),
It's in everything we see.

(CHORUS)

I won't go back to the sea,
Whatever's pulling you isn't pulling me,
I won't go back to the sea.

Did you really think, that this is what we need?
