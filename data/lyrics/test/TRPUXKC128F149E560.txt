Here by I return your love
I just wanna give it back
I am fading
The silence can be beautiful but also very cold
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong

Cause one thing I know
Somewhere out there there's a place where I belong
goodbye
But somewhere out there there's a place where I belong
goodbye
