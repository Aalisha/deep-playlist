Another day's gone by
And nothin' ever seems to change
And everything I love
I'm watchin' waste away

So what's the matter with me?
Couldn't tell, I just can't fake it
And I don't wanna believe
But this time I just can't take it

Just another day in my life
I don't wanna run out of time
I don't wanna wake up some day
And all my life is wasted away

There's so much that I wanna be
So everybody, listen to me
There's so many things on my mind
Just another day in my life
Another day in my life

So what's the point in life
