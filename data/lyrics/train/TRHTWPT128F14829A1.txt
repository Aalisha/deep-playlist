Well, she wants to be a singer in the band
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand
And a microphone
Looks like she's all alone
She can bring a friend
Though she's not my kind of friend
She keeps on staring me out with her
Ole black and blue eyes

And I can take her dancing
Just to give the girl a chance and
I was never that good
At being nice when I should
I guess that she'll forgive me
Right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's
"Come take me home" eyes
