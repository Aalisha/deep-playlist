10: 30 one more Friday night
I got my space
So I wont be getting heavy anymore

Bring on the one to save me
To you it might sound crazy
Way down inside my heart
I'm drowning

I'm in too deep
(In too deep, too deep, alright)
Let's take it easy, cool it down
(In too deep, gotta hold it back somehow)

Can't help the way I'm feeling
(In too deep, too deep, although)
I'm trying not to let it show
(In too deep, I can't let you go)
