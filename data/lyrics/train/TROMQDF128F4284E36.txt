Sampled:
...
Too tough to die

Martina:
I always wonder why
My mama left town
New Haven ain't a bag of salt
When nobody knows your name
You look so different over the phone
Seven states away they're doin'
Doin' the strange fruit swing
When they come down
You have to leave town

I am
Too tough to die
I am
...
