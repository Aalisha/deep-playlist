Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl

So you think no one cares, oh, boy
What a down thing to think of
And if you give me a chance
(If you give me a chance)
I will give you true love

And every day, I watch you
I just can't do without you
You're so doggone pretty
I got to have you and I've gotta say

Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
