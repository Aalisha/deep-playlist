I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be wrong

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be white, I could be black

Your time has come your second skin
The cost so high the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie

May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you

Could be wrong, I could be right
Could be wrong, I could be right

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white

They put a hot wire to my head
'Cos of the things I did and said
And made these feelings go away
Model citizen in every way
