This ain't working out
(This ain't working)
It's not worth the time I spent on it
When I've been next to you
(This ain't working)
It's not the way you want it
And all I wanna do
Is get away and as far away from it

There's no point 'cos I'm not winning
There's no point going back to the beginning
There's no point in hesitating
There's no point to keep on waiting
There's no point in talking it over
There's no point in getting any closer
