Your jugular arteries ripped
Viscous juices gush and bleed
You're gutted, skinned and mangled
Enteral disorder is freed
Your rib-cage wrenched and torn
Still-pumping heart is crushed and smashed
Your alimentary canal is finely chopped
Lumpen meat is hacked...

...Disembowel, chop and trash...

Veins are stripped and flayed
Of haemorrhage, bile and sweat
Savoured cuts are cured
Bodily parts are wrecked
Bissection of the twitching corpse
Copious blood is drained
...
