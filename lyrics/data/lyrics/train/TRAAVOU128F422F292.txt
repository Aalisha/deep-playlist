This took my fate, giving in
To your lips, To your Lies
You say that, that it would come back to haunt me
Crooked smile, the reflection in your eyes
That shows Why wait this for Beautiful mistakes

Something that I know you've seen before
I'm not the first
Set the trap, I've fallen for it every time
I can't believe, everyone you told this to
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you

Take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel it if
you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

Cutting Me, razor blades and perfect lines
Were just, you'll get anything you want
...
