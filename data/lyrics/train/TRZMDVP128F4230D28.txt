Step right up
Step right up
Step right up
everyone's a winner
bargains galore
that's right you too can be the proud owner of
the quality goes in before the name goes on

one tenth of a dollar
one tenth of a dollar
we got service after the sale

how 'bout perfume
we got perfume
how 'bout an engagement ring

somethin for the little lady
somethin for the little lady
somethin for the little lady

3 for a dollar

We got a year end clearance
we got our white sale on a smoke damaged furniture
you can drive it away today.

act now
act now

and receive as our gift
our gift to you
they come in all colors
one size fits all

no muss, no fuss, no spills
you tired of kitchen drudgery
everything must go

goin outta biz
goin outta biz
goin outta bizness sale

50% off original retail price
skip the middle man

dont settle for less
how do we do it
how do we do it
volume! volume!
turn up the volume!

you've heard it advertised

don't hesitate

don't be caught with your drawers down
don't be caught with your drawers down

you just step right up
step right up

that's right it fillets
it chops, it dices, it slices
it never stops
lasts a lifetime, it mows your lawn

and it mows your lawn
it picks up the kids from school
it gets rid of unwanted facial hair
it gets rid of embarassing age spots
it delivers the pizza

and it lengthens
and it strengthens
and it finds that slipper that's be enlodged under the
chaise lounge for several weeks
