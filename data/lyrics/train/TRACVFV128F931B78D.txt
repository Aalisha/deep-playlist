Tell us where you're from,
What you want to become
And we'll say if you're OK.
Where did you go to school,
Right answer and you're cool.
Yeah, you're the kid the whole day.
You got a sticker in your face
Information about the case,
So you know your potential.
Don't think you can extend.
Don't think you can extend, just comprehend.
But I don't wanna hear it.
No it's more than I accept.
