"One, two, one, two"

Lookin' all around me
What do I see?
Lots of changing faces
Lots of things to be
But I'm happy just to be
A part of all I see
As I turn around to look at you
And you look back at me

There isn't time to hang around
Anymore
So fill your heart with lovin'
And open up the door
Someone's calling out to you
That's what love is for
As I turn around to look at you
...
