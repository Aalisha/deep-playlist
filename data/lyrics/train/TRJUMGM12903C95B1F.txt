It's just a state of affection
Just need something to cure the infection
I don't want to be a misconception
No, no, don't want to break the connection

It's just the pent up aggression
That drives me into this direction
If I had to ask just one question
"Oh no, how come they don't listen?"

I don't want to slip, I don't want to fall
I don't want to care or be here at all
I don't want to crash, I don't want to burn
I don't want to forget

I'm a stranger that no one can see
A stranger to every part of me
