I know just what to say
It's just a game I play
Now I'm here on my own

I'd like to be with you
I guess you always knew
Still I'm all alone

I know the history
got it all worked out

It never happens to me, it never happens to me
(maybe that's the way my life was meant to be)
It never happens to me, it never happens to me
(love is just the door that's locked and there's no key)
It never happens to me...
