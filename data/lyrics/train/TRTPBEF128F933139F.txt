All you hypocrites and liars
In the temple seeking gain
All you senators and lawyers
With your motives to explain

All you victims and you heroes
Your petitions to complain
All you murderers and martyrs
On the fields where you lay slain

On the just and unjust, alike it doth rain
And the quality of mercy is not strained
Vengeance and revenge are just two words for pain
And the quality of mercy is not strained

Did not I crucify my Lord
Did not I bind Him in chain
...
