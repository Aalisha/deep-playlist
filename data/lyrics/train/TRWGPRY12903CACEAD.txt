Damn, the doctor's just finished telling me
There's no time, losing you could be the end of me
And that I should do the things that I wanna do
How could I without you, without you, oh

'Cause you're the only one I let in
Tell me how to stop this feeling spreading
I'm hoping somehow that you know, oh

Let's just get back together, we should've never broke up
They're telling me that my heart won't beat again
We should've stayed together, 'cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me that my heart won't beat again

Won't beat again, it's killing me
Hey, hey, hey

If I died, yeah, would you come to my funeral?
Would you cry, would you feel some regret that we didn't try?
