Late at night, all alone in the bathroom
You're freaking out
'Cause you just can't control everything
That happens around you

Set in stone with no proof of validity
Your so-called faith
Keeps you terrified of anything
That threatens your standing

The eyes of the world, the eyes of the church
The eyes of your peers
The wagging of tongues
Whispering shame, upon eager ears

Have all the plans that you laid out so carefully
Fallen short of your neo-Victorian fantasy
You cling to so desperately
