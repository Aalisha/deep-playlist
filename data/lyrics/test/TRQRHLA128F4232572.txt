Down in the region where I rest
It's the survival of the hardest
One man, well, cool, the next man, tense
Some sounds like these across the fence will

Trouble you, they trouble me, no I
I would'a just flash me things
Bubble you, they bubble me, yes I
Forward ina me ring

Trouble you, they trouble me, no I
I would'a just flash me things
Bubble you, they bubble me, yes I
Forward ina me ring

Some man just born to nice up, dance
See my love down in tight romance, yea
The essence of ishence fills the air, yea
You're free to look but don't you dare stare
