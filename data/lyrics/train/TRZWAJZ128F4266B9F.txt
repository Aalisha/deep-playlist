On the phone to Saturday
Where did you go
Cause the tequila from your kiss is still around
And you're down to remind me
Cause I know that you're away

And she can spin my motivation like a record off the wall
Don't you try for anyone but yourself

I can feel it's on your mind
Kristina falls down to the floor
She is fine and it's alright
She says to me
