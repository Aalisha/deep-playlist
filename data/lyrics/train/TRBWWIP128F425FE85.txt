Good bye, old friend,
This is the end of the man(girl) I used to be,
'cause there's been a strange and welcome change in me.

For once in my life I have someone who needs me,
Someone I've needed so long,
For once, unafraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong.
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew
Someone warm like you would make my dream come true.
