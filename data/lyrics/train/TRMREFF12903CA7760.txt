Haven't you heard about a fairy tale?
At a winter's night end of the year in five
The given one land to the world and now
Haven't you received a message from her?
That she's writing down on the wall with words of luck and stars
And you know, it's all just lies

To show you I missed
Those words out from your lips
You're a curse you're my gift

I wipe all your tears
At the side of the hill
