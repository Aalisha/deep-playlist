There will come a time
This life you live
Will catch up to you
And no one will be left
When honesty is blind
In ignorance exist the fallen.
We're begging for the truth

Night comes and the shadows fall
The lights appear
Across the city
I wonder where you are
The words you say are false
There is no compromise
...
