Lock the god-damn door
Blockade your fucking floor
And just wait for the first all-clear to come
Nail up all your frames,
Looks like they won't play games
You hear them clear on the streets,
Order to stay at home

They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
They're coming
Hear! They come
Here they come

The devils horde released
Hear! They come
Here they come and you're gonna be their feast
...
