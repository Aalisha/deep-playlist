At the bar when this six foot star
Came walking my way
He said shorty your looking kinda bored
Do you mind if I stay

My best friend said you gotta talk
'Cause I think he plays for Atlanta Hawks
But I can't play, maybe someday
But right now I'm okay

I gotta man
 (What's that got to do with me?)
I gotta man
 (I'm not tryin' to hit at, see)

I gotta man
 (What's that got to do with me?)
I gotta man
 (I'm not tryin' to hit at)

I gotta man and he may not be a baller
But he's so good to me
He's around, pick up every time I call him
And he makes me so happy
