Some people kill for less
Some people find it hard to get dressed
Some people, well...
Ask how old I am

Some people live in a life
Some people need more than a slice
But when it fades...
When the glitter's gone

You know it, you owe it to yourself
You won't let it make you mad
It's already crazy

Oh we're lonely one Mercedes down
The brighter lights and their smiles, their empty hands
...
