Awake at ground zero,
Another day wasting away,
Nothing seems to matter,
'Cause nothing's ever changed.

California dreamin',
Has never meant that much to me,
When living in this nightmare,
Comes so easily.

Holding on...
When I don't belong...

If this is right, then I can't go wrong,
Holding on...
But I know right now I'll never make it.

Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow,
And figure out where to begin.
Maybe I won't feel so hollow,
...
