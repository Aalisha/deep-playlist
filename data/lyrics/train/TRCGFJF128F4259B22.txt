When she said that you were through
I thought that there was nothing that I could d
Just because she ran right here
Doesn't mean I interfered
Now I'm wondering of we can feel the same

Like she's just waiting

She once told me how she felt
Didn't just want me to hear it from someone else
There were unknowns she couldn't know
