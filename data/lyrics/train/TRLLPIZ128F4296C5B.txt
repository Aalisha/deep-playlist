Well, like a bad penny you've turned up again,
You're in my sights, there's a mist on my lens.
I think you know how it was when I tripped and fell,
Well, you double-dealed me, baby and I broke like a shell.
Like a bad penny you've sure lost the glow
But I'm out of reach, your smile's sure gone cold.
Well, it can't ever be like it was then,
Well, don't you fool with me, baby,
Don't you mess with my plans.
