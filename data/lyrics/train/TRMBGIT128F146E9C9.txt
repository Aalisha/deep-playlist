Ahora los ojos
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

(Verse 1)
Its time to get lost in my music you get lost don't confuse it
I was born for this shit so I never had to choose it
I would kill for the chance to get on you get off
I'm not sayin that I'm hard I'm just sayin you soft
The world wanna know my past if I'm real or if I'm not
Did I really play the trap have I ever dealt a rock
