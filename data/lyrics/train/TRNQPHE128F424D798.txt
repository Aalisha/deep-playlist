I look out the window, see the fishes get the run-around
I tell the boys I gotta be movin' on
I'm tired of playin' the game, the ending's always the same
Odds are you won't last too long

I can see you, you can't see me
Don't feel shame no more
I'm not here, you're not there
That I know for sure

Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys

Left on the street to fend for yourself
