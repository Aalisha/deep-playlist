Sad and sorry
Troubled and tired
Wild with worry
Mad with desire, oh

Junky jitters
Bed bug critters
Now who would die for love?
Midnight favors
Sweet sick flavors
Now who would die for love?

You can see by the look in my eyes
That the devil takes his own
You can see by these holes in my heart
That I've still kept my soul
Well you can take it, go on and take it
