You're still making your mind up,
Can't decide which way it should be.
All the signals from you
Seem to drag out perpetually.

It's not subtle to me,
So unsettled for you.
It's not clear yet to either
'Cause when you gonna make your move?

And I can see why the heart tries to downplay
The hardest, hardest of the parts.

Hardest of the parts.

Can't get past all the conflict,
Can't decide to stay or to go.
