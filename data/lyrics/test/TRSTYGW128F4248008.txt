As the intensity became to brink
Struck by reality everywhere
Jilted in conversation, I drowned
Into her looks and pealed to the ground

Could I be trying too hard or would I be lying to you?

Have I missed my chance with her?
She knows how to get me she's got me right now
I'm stuck in the groove
Disappointment started from my end until parted
How I still think of her
