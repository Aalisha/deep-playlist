Our God is the God of gods
And our Lord is the Lord of kings
The revealer of secrets of mysteries unknown
Let the people praise our God
Let the people praise our God

His sovereign rule will last forever
His Kingdom won't decline or fall
He does as He pleases both in Heaven and Earth
Who am I that I should question Him at all?

Our God is the God of gods
And our Lord is the Lord of kings
The revealer of secrets of mysteries unknown
Let the people praise our God
