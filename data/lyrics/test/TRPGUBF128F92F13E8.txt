The first thing I did when you said goodbye
Was sit myself down and have a real good cry
The next thing I did was put my red Dress on
And go downtown dancing 'till the break of dawn

A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do
And now I gotta get to gettin' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do

Fancy meeting you at our stomping ground
