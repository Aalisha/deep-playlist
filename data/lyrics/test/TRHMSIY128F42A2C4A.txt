A little girl cries next door
I just wanna hold her hand
Sometimes it gets so tough
With my head buried in the sand

And everyday more people die
Walk away, avert their eyes
As the death clock ticks, the trigger clicks
Beaten with a crucifix

Bullet proof lies, family ties
Which one's right, no one's wise
In a world that lies

Walk away, tomorrow's another day
Walk away, why not let it fade away
Walk away, tomorrow's another day
Walk away, the problem will go away

A little boy cries next door
I just wanna hold his hand
Sometimes it gets so hard
With my head buried in the sand
...
