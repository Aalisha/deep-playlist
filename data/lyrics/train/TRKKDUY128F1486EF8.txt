You tell me what you want
And you try to tell me what I need
But your smile can never sell me
What I don't believe
Now the gun is in your hand
And all the words are on your tongue

They gave you everything when you were young
You threw it all away when you were done
You pray you found that chosen someone

It's not me, I don't wanna be
I'm not the cure, I'm not your savior
Now there's danger every second that you breathe
It's not me, I don't wanna be
And now the truth cuts like a razor
Your're gonna have to save yourself
You better look for someone else
