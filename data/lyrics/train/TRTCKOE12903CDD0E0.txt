The inset of rigor mortis
Ulcerous corruption and decay
Saponified fats lather as soap
As you slowly eat yourself away

Organs savaged by rotten enzymes
Rennin and ranus cysts
A festering abcess
Immersed in ravenous autolysis

Breaking down of dead tissue
Fuels methane gases
A smouldering human compost-heap
Of self-digesting haemorrhage
Emulsifying carnage
Your purpulent torso is mummified
A mortified
Marbled feast for drooling parasites

Your lungs consumed in gore
Slime and worm encrusted
Brittle testes eroded in hot
Corrosive succus
...
