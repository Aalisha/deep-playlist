Look at me tell me what you see
Am i everything i'm meant to be
How can you breathe lien next to me
Airs so hard to find when you're with me

I'm leaving you behind
I'm going all alone
And this is what it's like to be on your own

I can't see this time
Stars have left your eyes
Falling down to words that i left behind

It's not me this time
I'm not in your sky
