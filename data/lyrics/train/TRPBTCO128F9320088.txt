You smell like cigarettes and violets
You invite me in but won't tell me your name
Your hands held all the aces
Kings and queens but still you lost the game
Messed up like a sunset
Too close to be a star
Messed up like an actor
That got stuck doing porn
Messed up skipping dinner
And living on popcorn
Messed up like a song
Right turn in the wrong lane
A quick fix but all your love's in vain
Best schools worst grades
