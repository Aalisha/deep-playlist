Coming over mountains
the pale beside the wall between us now
since I refuse to play alone
it's always been another
to do the damage you live everyday
and leave you cursing for escape
Each day I see a ball and chain
grow a little more in grain
and watch your corner pain
say'in nothing
nothing's gonna change
why is the world so damn unkind
to one so righteous in her mind
the sun won't rise and shine
will you never find your peace of mind
My father couldn't bother
