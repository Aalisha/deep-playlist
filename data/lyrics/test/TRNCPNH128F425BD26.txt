Let's head out to see the moon
We have to do it real soon
I'll leave my wallet by the phone
I gotta make it with you

Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you
Tonight, I'll leave you on your own
Tonight, I'll leave with you

Understand I need a drink
I need to get it real soon
In need but still I fell asleep
Forgot what I had to do
