Are we running so far from facing the numbers who
Clash in an empty room?
For false visions we search and the reflections consume
But the mirror is everyone's tomb

What we'll find in the waste of time
All these self-hating days in the image maze
Losing sight of our roots in the empty shells
Where everyone fights themselves

Everyone fights themselves
We're tired of looking out from blank eyes

I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, until it comes right in the window
Blank eyes, I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
Outside, another answer for our crimes
