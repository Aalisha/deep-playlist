(INTRO)
Yo.
Yo.
Yo Girl
Yo Girl
I take a shower and I think about you.
I put on my clothes and I think about you.
I read the paper and I think about you.
I fix my dinner and I think about you.
I lay in bed and I think about you.
What I'm I gonna do
What I'm I gonna do

Chorus
I take a shower and I think about you.
I put on my clothes and I think about you.
I drive my car and I think about you.
What am I to do.
I read the paper and I think about you.
I fix my dinner and I think about you.
I lay in bed and I think about you.
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do.

Verse 1
I heard they say that
distance makes the heart grow closer.
Well I will never get over the way we were that night.
And I want to get it back.
So if you out there please listen to this message from me.
Know that right here I'm thinkin 'bout you.
Hope that you too.
Will another day.
Cuz all I do is...
