Modern art makes me
Want to rock out
Modern art makes me
Want to rock out

Modern art makes me
Want to rock out
Modern art makes me
Want to rock out

So, I'm in the Tate
And I'm looking at Hockney
And wow, there's something
Amazing about that blue

It makes me want to step outside
I want to loosen my tie
Sweet Jesus, my heart
Is beating faster and faster
