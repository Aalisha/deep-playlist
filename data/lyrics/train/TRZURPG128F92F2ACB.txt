6 a.m and bobby's wakin up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sisters room across the hall
Hey daisy rise and shine
He pores two bowls full of captain crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
The bus is here we love you mom
He made the breakfast
Hr did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to
Oh he's only 10
Just comin of age
he otta be out playin ball
And video game
Climbin trees or on a bike
Just ridin around
But its hard to be a kid
