Don't have to go out
Lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you it's a matter of time
That's when you're gonna need someone behind you
A true friend isn't easy to find
 
You're gonna find out
You're gonna find out
You're gonna find out who your true friends are
There will come a time
Somewhere down the line
You're gonna find out who your true friends are
 
Room full of people
They start talkin'
