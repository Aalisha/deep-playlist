(feat. Guru)
[Verse 1: Guru]
Rotten scum has found its way to power
Time to protect projects, check the hour
I'm fed worse than just angry
Ready for action, baby
Not gettin' lazy, not goin' crazy
Cause I'ma make something happen
Not when just a member when I'm rappin'
For real, and it's amazing to me
How suckas be hopelessly fakin' to be
Somebody on-point and influential
Yet they got no talent and never had no potential
Cause they lack the bear essential
Strength of the mental, the soulful vocals
Crushing all you ugly oculs
People try to rate me like I'm the pulse
But then they find that I'm the most
...
