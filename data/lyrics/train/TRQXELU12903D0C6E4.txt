Baby (baby), baby gives sweet loving,
leaves me meaning nothing,
nothing left to mean.
Baby (baby), baby gots me sighing,
nealry has me dying,
dying off to me.
Chorus:
From here to eternity...
That's where she takes me.
Frome here to eternity...
She does, she does, she does, she does.
From here to eternity...
That's where she leads me.
