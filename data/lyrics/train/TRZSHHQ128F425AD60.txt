Kinda lose your sense of time
'Cause the days don't matter no more
All the feelings that you hide
Gonna tear you up inside
You hope she knows you tried

Follows you around all day
And you wake up soaking wet
'Cause between this world and eternity
There is a face you hope to see, yeah

You know where you've sent her
You should know where you are
You're trying to ease off
But you know you won't get far

And now she's up there, sings like an angel
But you can't hear those words
...
