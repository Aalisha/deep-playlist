Another day of no more you
Im giving everyone attitude
I'm losing air im slowly dying
kill me if i cant be around you
i dont wanna be too dramatic
breaking up is problematic
i dont even know what to do

(CHORUS)
but all i know is that im missing you
i dont care bout nothing else but you
im like 2 steps (2 steps from losing it)
one more step i disconnect
feel like i might as well be dead
no i really dont think i'll make it without you
not about to baby


i try to deal but it dont make sense
i cant believe this is happening
im losing tears
living this life
if u were here
im sure they would drown you
(no)i dont wanna make it sound so tragic
(no)i believe we stil got magic
i just need to know you do too


(CHORUS)
