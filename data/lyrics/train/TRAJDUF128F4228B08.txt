Moving close so I can feel your heat
I'll keep you dancing till the morning light, yeah
I can't see but the way you move
That you can feel the music too
We don't seem to have to prove 'cause we know...
It must be the music
What's turning me on
It must be the music
What's turning me on
Yeah
It must be the music
Yeah
