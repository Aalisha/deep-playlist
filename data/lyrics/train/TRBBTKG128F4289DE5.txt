Burgers and fries and cherry pies, it was simple and good back then
Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know

Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
All the things we used to say, little things we did each day
...
