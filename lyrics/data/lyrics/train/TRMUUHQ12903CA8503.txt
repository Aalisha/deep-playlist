You know it only breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark,
Alone waiting there for me
To come back
I'm too afraid to show

Chorus
If it's coming over you
Like it's coming over me
Crashing like a tidal wave
That drags me out to sea
And I wanna be with you
If you wanna be with me
I'm crashing like a tidal wave
And I don't wanna be
Stranded, stranded, stranded, stranded

I can only take so much
These tears are turning me to rust
I know you're waiting there for me
...
