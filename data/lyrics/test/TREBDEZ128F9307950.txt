You said it was nothing
It must have been something
You said it was nothing
But something it is
I know I was there when it was happening
I know I was there when it was happening

A crack in the mirror, I see a different side of you
I was just leaving, so don't call the cops
My kingdom will crumble like dominos
My kingdom will crumble like dominos

I got problems too, and one of them is you
...
