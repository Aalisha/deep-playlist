We were barely seventeen
Two kids with the grown up dream
Of a perfect love 
Foolin' round in my first car
Careful not to go too far
That's how it was.

We had a simple wedding
You looked beautiful in white
And I recall your mother's blessing
On our wedding night.
I wish you every happiness
And may you always have the best
Of the good things in life.
