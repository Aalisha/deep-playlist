Album: Black Dog [Original Soundtrack]

Sometimes many miles may lay between us
But only for the job I choose to do
And one thought helps me through my darkest hour
Each mile brings be closer to you.

Please believe you're all I ever wanted
If you should leave I don't know what I'd do
I'd be like a child afraid of darkness
The greatest fear I have is losing you.
