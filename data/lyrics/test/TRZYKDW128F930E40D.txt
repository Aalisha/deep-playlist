Yo, they don't know how Next is gonna come
Divine style in 9-7 y'all, so get ready, check it out
One time, one time, ah ah ah for your mind
Yeah, check this out, listen baby

Girl what were you thinking when you ran down on me
Tryin' to blow the spot for all of your girls to see
All up in this place with your hands at my face
What's that all about, can we talk it out babe

I gotta let you know how it is and where I'm coming from
So you can see where we're at, I'll never disrupt your flow
Even when you're hanging with your little old friends
And that's a fact

Baby, come on let's get it right
We been together too long and I don't wanna fight
So take a sip on this style
Baby be strong 'cuz I know you didn't mean it

I don't really mind when you're hanging with your girlfriends
Representing, because you represent me
And I don't really mind when you're dancing
...
