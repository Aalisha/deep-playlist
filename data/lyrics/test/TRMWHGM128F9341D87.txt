Ballard

There are times when you're feeling so good
That the only way to move is down
You're feeling fine, looking like a king
Then you turn around and you're painted like a clown.

Nights you feel you're about to win
The gold in your pocket turns to tin.

Thunder, lightning, striking again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.
