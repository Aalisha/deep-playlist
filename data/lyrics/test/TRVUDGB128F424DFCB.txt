Oh oh. sometimes

The way I
love too much and I
give too much and ya
take so much
til I
ain't got nothin'
And your energy
how it weighs on me
steady
drainin' me
until I'm empty
Wantin' better days
and all your crazy ways
am I lovin' you in vain? Somebody to help me
I don't need negativity
I just need some clarity (sometimes I wanna love you) ooh ooh ooh

Sometimes
I wanna hate you
sometimes I wanna
grab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away
oh oh oh boy
I wanna
love you
