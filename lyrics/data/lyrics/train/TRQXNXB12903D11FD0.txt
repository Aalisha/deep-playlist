And now, the end is near
and so i face the final curtain (ha ha ha!)
you cunt, i'm not a queer
i'll state my case, of which i'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
and each and every highway
and much, much more than this
i did it my way

Regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
but i did . what i had to do
i'll see it through without devotion
I planned, each chartered course
...
