Warning signs
All around you
Yellow lines
They divide you
These warning signs

In time
You may regret
(You might learn from)
Things you do
'Cause you have to
The nights that end in curfew

Well I Know What It's Like
I've been here before
Please believe me
You know it breaks my heart
The way you are
So untrusting
