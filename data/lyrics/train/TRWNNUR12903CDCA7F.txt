i stand opposed of what i've been taught my whole life
my family entangled by the church of rome
followed traditions of man - never followed my own
my creed - not saved by works, but by grace alone
no pope, no priest, nor cardinal over me
i call no one father except the one true God
Christ is my mediatior i will repent to him alone
