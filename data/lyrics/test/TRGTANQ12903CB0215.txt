She flips on the light
And she looks in the mirror
She cries to herself
It's becoming much clearer
That he's not where he says
He's not hanging with her
She flips off the light
And she turns with a shiver
And when he comes home
His embrace is so cold
It's like being caught
In a rough strangle hold
Now her resolve's gaining strength
To tell him so long
But for now she'll just keep hanging on

Cause the little things remind her
Of the good times they have had
Whenever she recalls those things
It's hard to think that he's so bad

It seems no matter where she goes
She can hear their song on the radio, radio
...
