Staying in again on a Saturday night,
I'm going to settle on the sofa and turn down the lights.
I got 900 channels but there's nothing to see,
No wonder everybody thinks they should be on TV.

We all want to be famous.
Be a face on the screen.
Read our name in the papers.
Everybody wants to be on TV.

Everybody wants to be on TV.

Forget Audrey Hepburn, Forget Bette Davis.
I want to be known, just for being famous.
I can't act, I can't dance, I can't sing, can't you see?
But I'm young and I'm pretty and that's all that you need.
