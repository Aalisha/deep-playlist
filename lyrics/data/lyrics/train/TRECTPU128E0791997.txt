Fifty years after the fair
The picture I have is so clear
Underneath the clouds in the air
Rose the Trylon and the Perisphere

And that for me was the finest of scenes
The perfect world across the river in Queens

Fifty years after the fair
I drink from a different cup
But it does no good to compare
Cause nothing ever measures up
