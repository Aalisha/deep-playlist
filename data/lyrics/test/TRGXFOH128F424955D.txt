[Intro: Hell Razah]
Run, man... hurry up, hurry up
They coming, they coming, man!
Keep going, keep going
Move, move, move, move, hurry up
Move, move... don't stop, don't stop
Hurry up, man... move, move, move, move
They gon' kill us, hurry up... uh
18 to 28...

[Hook: Hell Razah]
They got a bounty on my head and a tag for your toe
I'm here to sing a song, til they let my people go
Real about, turn about, my chrome forty four
Everytime I pull it out, it's fuck Jim Crow...

[Hell Razah:]
It's like Moses and Pharaoh, now it's the Big Apple
I'm just a runaway slave, these devils can't tackle
We slippin' out of handcuffs and breaking out of shackles
I'm Nat Turner in the mind of a time capsule
We not no Buckwheats or Little Rascals
Or Diff'rent Strokes, or whatever have you (watch your mouth)
A lil' fame... a record deal don't make your freedom
If man don't live by bread alone, how we gonna feed him
So I choose to bring the truth about the seed of Edem
