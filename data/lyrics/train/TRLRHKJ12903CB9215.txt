They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison
Recorded sound

They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother

Why they told Marconi wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But, oh, you came through
