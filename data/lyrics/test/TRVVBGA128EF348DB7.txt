Make a wish in a water fly
Trust your heart I will make you cry
I only hope that it'll last forever
I know that it's now or never

Hey yeah, don't you know me
Hey yeah, why don't you show me
Hey yeah, where I'm going in

Spend a night by the candle fire
I don't bid you and I know it's bad
No word and I send relation
No word and I wanna forget you
