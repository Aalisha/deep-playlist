You walk in, half past nine
Lookin' like a queen
Serving me with papers
Calling me obscene

Woman, I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the poor house
And you'll take all the rest

Up all day, down all night
Working on the job
Everything I do is wrong
I always end up robbed

Woman I try so hard
Done all I can do
...
