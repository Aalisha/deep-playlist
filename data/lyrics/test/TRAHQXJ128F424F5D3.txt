So many nights alone my thoughts run in circles
Fighting the demons in my head
Now all of the fear is gone,
the hurt turned to anger
I think of the things I should have said

Give it a second chance, taking another look
I’m laying it on the line,
my heart’s an open book
I’m not giving in to anger, not this time
I can’t keep it all inside,
believe it when I say it’s comin’

Always from the heart,
Always from the soul
...
