I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 
I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 
I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 
I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 

You would judge 
You would judge 
You would judge 
You would judge 

I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 
I've Got A Secret I can't tell you 
I've Got A Secret I can't tell you
