It's late at night and you're not home
I'm still waiting for your call
But it never, it never comes
Do you ever think of me?
Can you hear my empty plea
For your love and affection?

I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I can't let go?
It's what you do and not what you say
That keeps you one step away

Am I that easy to forget?
If only you'd make one sacrifice
Do what it takes to make it alright
Am I that easy to forget?
