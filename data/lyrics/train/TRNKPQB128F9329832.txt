Did you come to hate
The irony of fate
Or are you wasting time
Waiting for a sign
Ready to resign
Now as matters stand
Yet more answers in demand
This ain´t no test
Take a time to rest
We try our best

Make it worse
Finish last
Started first
Fail to swim
Learn to drown
Growing up
Falling down
Wait and see
Hurry up
Take good care
Give a fuck
Love and rage
Come undone
Turn the page
And then we start over again
And then we start over again

This is how it goes
And nobody knows
Don´t ask no more
What is it good for
You did it all before
...
