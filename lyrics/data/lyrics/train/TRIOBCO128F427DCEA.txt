Yeah, keep that
Huh. what a mess
Yeah. I see you (PRIMO!)
Yeah. I was blessed with some clarity right?
Uh-huh, hah. I'ma sit back
Tell you niggaz what I been lookin at, huh

(Xzibit)
Y'all niggaz is killin me
You got Bloods and Crips in New York City, is anybody feelin me?
I ain't concerned with who gon' shoot who
I'm only concerned with music, and who break through
FUCK YOU, for thinkin platinum is the ultimate goal
These faggot niggaz gettin they money, but losin they soul
I don't wanna hear shit from you niggaz with no background
No backbones, you get no chance to back down
Deal how we deal witcha, peons, no chips
Changin whips out so they can look richer
I see the big picture, startin in the kitchen
with bricks and Pyrex pots, the widescreen edition
Listen, I seen niggaz hit with so much time loc
They have to die and come back three times to see them white folks
Take notes, cause you will be tested
Vested up, drunk as fuck, large caliber weapons
