Deep under the surface I keep the love.
Older and aware of a hidden universe.
I've prayed to be young and prayed to be inspired.
Words of your tongue blister like fire.

I can't let you go.
Slow down don't leave.
Dying days of my youth.
Over take me.

There is a glimpse of death in your eye's.
I'm not prepared to let out those cries.
I plead to stay young soon will be expired.
