ooohh, that's what I'm talkin' about
Ice Berg, 2006, remember this

Go Ice man
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "uha"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "yeah"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "uha"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not that kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
Shook cats get lifted off thier feet with heat
Nobody loves, you can feel the cold in thier hugs
At each man checks his weapon that protects his life
And last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
No, I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
But then you stepped to me "Damn"
Blew my whole spot up
Dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
Ugh, you made me revaluate my G
Now I'm gangster for you baby, and you gangster for me
And we're walking...

Go Ice man "ugh"
Walking in the rain with the people that I love, feels so fine "you know"
