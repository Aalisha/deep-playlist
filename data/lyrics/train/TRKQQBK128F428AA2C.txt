NICKEL SONG
*with refrain from "MUSIC! MUSIC! MUSIC!"

* Put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I ever want from you is music

I'll do anything for you anything you want me to
All I ever, all I ever wanted was music

Well you know that I'm not a gambler but I'm being gambled on
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song
