Unbalance starts to rise within the population,
revolution begins
A hunger for power is launched, their dreams:
becoming the leader of the
alliance
A hidden disturbance is felt throughout the community,
its force augments
The stakes are increasing, tension is high, a clash
of the titans
begins to shed reality on the realm

Guidance ignored, they strive to acheive thier goals

Opponents will grow
they will plan a future
Disregarding lives
to focus on their desires
The end of a race begins

Allies will assist
honour is revealed
...
