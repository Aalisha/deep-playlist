I'm bringin my baby back home
Bringin my baby back home
Worries are over
Dark clouds are gone
I'm bringin my baby back home
Bringin my bluebird day
Tear the bummers away
My Worryin's over
Been away too long
And I'm bringin my baby back home

I'm bringin my baby back home
Bringin my baby back home
Worries are over
