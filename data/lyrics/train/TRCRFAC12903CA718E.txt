[Verse 1]
We got, single moms that can't afford to feed children
World War 3 got planes flying into building's
Corrupt cops and robbers, thieves and politicians
They just keeping taking as the world keeps spinning
Just take a look around now
A long way from your MTV cribs with your full speaker surround sound
Get ready for countdown
Just to get some benefits, my girl lied to them people down town
It's funny how we start out cool, but get corroded
By our quest for power and the people that behold it
We up one minute then down before you know it
