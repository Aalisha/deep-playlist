Give it up for me please
Put your hands in the air
If you know what's good for you
You wanna shake it like you just don't care

Would you please clap your hands
Now get up on your feet
I beg of you to get up and dance
It's such a crazy kick ass beat

Pardon me
The music is moving
Moving from left to right
Apologies
For losing my cooling
Losing the day to night

Since I'm asking so nice
Would you just entertain
There's nothing left to hide you away
