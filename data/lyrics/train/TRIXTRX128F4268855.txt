In times of greed and jealousy
When clouds fullfill the sky
The rain will fall
It's hiding the tears from my eyes

A trip right into fantasy
The colours of my soul
Will take me there
Where confident spirits will flow

Where I can find peace of mind

Take me back where I belong
Give me back my pride
Building castles in the sand
