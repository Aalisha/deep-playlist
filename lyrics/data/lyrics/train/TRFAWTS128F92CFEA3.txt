I pray for rain because I'm trying
To find god and make him cry,
Because I'm dying in a fire beneath my covers.
And somewhere out across the way,
You ask for salt across a plate,
And you can't find a word to say
To your own brother.

And you could call me over now,
And we could fix this with our mouths,
But you don't buy the farm,
If you can't afford the cow.

And you say Dylan is a sentiment
That you don't want to share,
And you say you looked back in anger
And it rose to meet your stare,
And you say I am not the one
Who puts the bullet to your gun
And makes it flare.
And you say Dylan is a sentiment to you,
And you don't want to share.
