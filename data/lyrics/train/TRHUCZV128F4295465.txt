I see a home in a quiet place
I see myself in a strong embrace
And I feel protection from the human race
It's not parental

But it's a fantasy, not a reality
And it's no good, no, no good for me, you have no idea

That I'm walking through the clouds
When you're looking at me
I'm feeling like a child
Vulnerability
I am shaking like a leaf if you move beside me
And you're all that I see
But it's no good for me

You have a home (You have a home), in a quiet place
...
