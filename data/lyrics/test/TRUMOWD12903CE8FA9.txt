Nside the anger grows
From words made up of dust
The false lept from the breath of centuries
Tearing our lives apart

Worlds below sleep in ignorance
With dissention from the skies
Mass daily chanting gleam of madness
In their eyes

Decadence within the law
Wage destruction on the void
Devour all that's held as sacred
Fools will feast well tonight
