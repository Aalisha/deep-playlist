All mine, all night
All mine
(All mine)
all night
Ooh don't try to fake it
'Cause I just can't take it
'Cause I'm right in the middle
Of a love, babe
Ooh I got your number
And your love I'm under
And I'm right in the middle
Of a love
(And I) I need you now
Got to have you by my side
Got to make you mine all mine (And I)
I need you now
Got to have you by my side
Got to make you mine all mine
(All mine, all night)
Yeah (All mine)
You call my number
It's your love I'm under
