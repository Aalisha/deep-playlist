Can't see the truth in triggered words
Don't need a mountain for a wall
See the big old moon spin around the world
Somehow it makes me feel so small

I know I've been living the simple life
Really that's the main thing
Nowadays nobody speaks about
The way they feel about things

I know I need something to set me right
And now it seems there's nothing
And nowadays nobody thinks about
A way to ease the suffering

Baby, I know you're the first thing
I believe in, honestly
How do you prove what you can't see?
Well, it's a question of faith

Baby, I know you're the first thing
I believe in, honestly
Say you don't know enough about me
Well, it's a question of faith

Don't wanna complain, the weather could be worse
But I wish I'd learned from my mistakes
Don't really need no clever words
To understand what's in your face

Know I've been living the simple life
