Check

Me an' Sonny in the Escalade, TV where yo' head lay
Uptown, Harlem World, seein' [Incomprehensible]
With some bran bran, got a jaw hit [Incomprehensible]
Hun'ned Gs for the suit, the hood like, "Oh, man"

Bendin' corna's, twenty-two's, no dubbin'
That's what you hear 'cause that shit be rubbin'
I gotta fix that, ooh, damn, who is that?
Dark skin, five ten, twist an' hella thick

Pull this bitch over, so I can do what I do
Get digits, call later an' teach you about you
Mami giggle an' smile, said she diggin' my style
Country boy, rugged for life, never come off foul

Put you on a team with me
First class to the Bahamas, the scenery
When I walked off, she called me back on the scene
Like, "Who the St. Lunatics an' what them double Bs mean?"

The double B stands for the chh chh, boom D boom
Lunatic bass an' beats, catch ya shakin' the room
So what, what? Bomp, bomp
What, what? This shit bomp

The double B stands for the chh chh, boom D boom
Lunatic bass an' beats, catch ya shakin' the room
So what, what? Bomp, bomp
What, what? This shit bomp
