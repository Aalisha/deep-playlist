We both know it's going to be another long winter
The kind that freezes shut the doors of early spring
But I'll still let you in
When I hear you knocking, with a whisper
I'll open the doors and I'll let you in

Depressing things are empty beds and lonely dinners
And women who are middle aged with naked fingers
I'll buy myself a ring
To symbolize this marriage every time I break the locks to let you in

Cause nothing's worse than seeing you worse than me
