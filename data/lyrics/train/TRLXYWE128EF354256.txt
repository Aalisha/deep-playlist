I don't get tired, tired anymore
I just don't try, try like before
I can't remember, remember last time I cried
Don't feel alright, I think I wanna die

I haven't done the best I can
But I learned to be alone
And I learned to be a man
Now everything I see, I think I've seen before
I don't think I want to see a thing anymore

I wanna die, Oh lord I want to die
I said, I wanna die, I know I wanna die

It must be easy, easy to be free
