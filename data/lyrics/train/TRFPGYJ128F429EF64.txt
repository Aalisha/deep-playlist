I watched you steal away
A man's best years
With the drumming of his fingers
And the kicking of his heels

I watched you put away
Your sweetest sins
I watched tempters satisfy
With the sweetest taste of wasted time

Don't let me disappear
Don't let me fall apart
Don't lead me to the wayside
Just don't let me go
Don't let me fade away

I watched him travel down
A steady road
With no milestones
Just a gentle slope

Soft underfoot, no sudden turns
Warn of sliding down that safe and sound
But not too familiar road
This is all too familiar
...
