Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that
Pump that, pump that
Yeah, I want that

Uh, I want, you want
We wanna do that
Uh, I want, you want
We wanna do that

It's alright, it's okay
You gonna pump our gas someday
On fire all night
Make it hot like great white

I don't know if you know
Okay, here we go
Time to make it really hot
Pump it, give me all you got

We pump, you pump
Dump trucks blow the trumpet
