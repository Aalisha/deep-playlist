Walking for you so impatiently
I know what you want
My roots are yours too
From that look in my eyes
You can really see
Men are noy like us
So will you sacrifice
And live on lies
Whatever is your request
I will comply
I don't think it will help you much
But don't ask me why
In return do me a favour
Open up your mind
Let me look inside
You
And dissect all your
signs
Why does she betray
Us
