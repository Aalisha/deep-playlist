With our hands held high, we're singing
Whoa, whoa oh
Whoa, whoa oh

I'm not afraid to make big mistakes
I'm not afraid to fall flat on my face
I need to get this looked at
Need to get this looked at
I need some time to think about
What I've done
One last thing before I go

With our hands held high, we're singing
Whoa, whoa oh
Whoa, whoa oh
And with our feet we stomp a cadence for you
With our hands held high, we're singing
Whoa, whoa oh
