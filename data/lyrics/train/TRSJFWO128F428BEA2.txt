Hey, yeah, inseparable lovers
From the start I really don't know
What's going on in my heart
Hey, I've got this feeling
That you will be mine all mine until the end of time

As I go, as I go, go along, go along
I can feel you keepin' me strong
Each and every day as I go my way
My love is all for you and it's here to stay
I've been waiting, I've been waiting

Why baby, do you make me feel that way?
I'm glad I got you in my love today
I'll never doubt your love will stay
Your love will stay always

Why baby, do you make me feel that way?
I'm glad I got you in my love today
