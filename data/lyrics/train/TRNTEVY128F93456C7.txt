(Need Somebody)
When somebody reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through
Cause everybody needs someone around
Things can tumble down on you

You'll discover when you look around
You don't have to be alone
Just one lover is all you need to know
When you're feeling all alone

Oh, you might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)
