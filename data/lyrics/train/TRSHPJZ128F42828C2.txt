Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay

There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down

You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

You can't believe all the things
I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying
I've lived on the edge of a knife

Well, I've played with fire
But I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true
So I think that it's time for a turn

Before I burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell

Take a good look in your heart
Tell me what do you see?
