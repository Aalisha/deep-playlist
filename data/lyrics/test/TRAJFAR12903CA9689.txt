I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the changes that you put me through
You used all my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet
I wanna know, won't you tell me, am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul, put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
