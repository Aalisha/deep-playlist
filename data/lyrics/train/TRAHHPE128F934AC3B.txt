Wake up - it's time to die
Wake up - it's time to die

Time is running out on me like tears in the rain
Too painful to live in fear when there's no one left to blame
We're nexus six replicates, superior to man
I think therefore I am, but there's one thing I don't
understand

Alive - why can't I be - if you could see what I've seen
I can't tell if I've been, alive, man or machine

The light that burns twice as bright, burns half half as long
The past is all we have now, we have nothing at all
...
