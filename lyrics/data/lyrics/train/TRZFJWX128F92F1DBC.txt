All of the lonely nights
Waiting for you to come
Longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come
Bringing your love to me

But I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

As life is reality
When you are near to me
I am in ecstasy (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'd swallow the pain and pride
Baby, I just can't hide
All that I feel inside
