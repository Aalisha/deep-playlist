Mama says there's trouble, yeah trouble, on the streets today
She says all the little ones got nowhere, got nowhere to play
And she's right, yes indeed she's right
But she don't believe
That I will change it all someday
People keep pushin' me, pushin' me everyway
They think I'm gonna keep takin' it, takin' it every day
But they're wrong, yes indeed I'm strong
Built for speed
I will change it all someday

There's a three minute warning
Before the whistle blows
There's a three minute warning
Before I overload
I'll give you three more minutes 'fore I lose my head
Three more minutes and you'll wish you were dead
...
