- gangsta boo]
Yeah, y'all know what time it is nigga
I'm bringin' a lot of shit today
I'm bringin m-child
I'm bringin' two for ya
I'm also bringin' the pain nigga
'cause when I come, I'm comin' for you
So you better ask some-mothafuckin-body
For the 9-8, until 2 g's nigga
I'm takin' over
You understand this type of shit
Three 6 mafia, hypnotize, prophet posse
Fuck you bitch!

(m-child)
1 - when we high off that green and gin
Ain't no tellin what we'll do
You got some ani' with the crew?
(fuck you! fuck you!)
With that heat we be bussin
Conversation no discussion
Hollow points they comin straight at you!
(fuck you! fuck you!)

Repeat 1

Bustin' bitches daily, maybe it's the herb in me
I wanna see what you hidden for, shake 'em and see
Time to steal, time to kill, time to get real, and wassup
I'm just a beefin' in the club, tear that fuckin' bitch up
I'm in the corner 'round some smoke, smokin' fine ass weed
Freakin' like vanessa del rio, won't you take you a peak
Mob, it was me, bringin' shit to the door
I be the lady unabomber, bombin' bitches and mo'
So time to go toe to toe, with a bitch that be rockin'
Ain't nothin' stoppin' prophet posse 'til your body be droppin'
You fuckin' bitch, spittin' rhythms in your rhyme like a joke
I'm gonna tote you like a 90 when I'm pullin' that dope
I know you're hopin' that I'll fall to my face, but I ain't
My shoes are stuck to the ground when I walk out on bank
Another fuckin' lp dropped like it's some rice
