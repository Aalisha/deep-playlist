Hear the beating heart, drifting, drifting
Hear the beating heart searching for love
Hear the beating heart drifting in silence
It echoes like circles around your heart

Show me the magic door
Show me the silver cloud
Open your heart, let it fall into place
Show me the circle's edge

Hear the beating heart, drifting, drifting
Hear the beating heart searching for love
