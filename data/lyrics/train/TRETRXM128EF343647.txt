You can't fool me
I can read you like a book
I can see that leaving in your eyes
I even know that look
You think that I dont know 
You think i have no clue
I guess letting me down easy
Was more than you could do

Chorus:
You could've left me, before I let you in
You couldv'e left me before we tired what might have been
you could've left me before you did me wrong
But you can't leave me know
