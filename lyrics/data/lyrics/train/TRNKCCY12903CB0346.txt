Dragon Goetia
Red gold on cold stone
With the dead arise

Rise winged serpent
Before the unseen
Rise the serpenteye star

Through times of war
A victor is crowned
A beast of gigantic size

Summoned by words never spoken before
Called upon for this war

Arise
Armada
Undefeatable will

Given wings
Claw crown of the kings
Death the reptile eye brings

Pulse of the Earth
The march of the Armada
Fleet of Marauders
A sign of a coming tide
...
