I can feel the whole world spinning around
I'm losing ground, I feel it every day
And I can feel you coming inside out
I'm losing touch with all reality

I remember the look in your eyes
The way that they pulled me inside
All I've got now in my defence is my innocence
I've been hypnotised

(Hypnotised)

I can hear the church bells ringing out
Reminds me of some bright and sunshine day
When all the pretty horses you would ride
Would come right back to feel your energy

I still remember the look in your eyes
