Yeah, this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas' mamas...
Mamas' mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (OOOH)
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (OOOH)
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

I apologize a trillion times

My baby's drama mama's mama, don't like me
She doing things like havin' her boys come from her neighborhood

To the studio tryin' to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the American pie and take her bite out

That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't no one to lay down
She wanna rip you up start a custody war, my lawyer stay down
She never had a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts, on my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (OOOH)

I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
