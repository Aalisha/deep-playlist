They're spreading lies in the paper
Don't let it get you down
Figure out the face that shouts
The first one's in, the last one out
Take a look around you
Stay on your toes
Someone took the words from your mouth
And the breath from your lungs
Just go
Get down till the music stops
No one knows
Can't decide what's your fate
This mine this is late
