My life is a stereo, how loud does it go?
What songs do I know? What ever happened to my plans?
Whatever happened to the life I thought I had?
My life is a stereo, kinda cheaply made though
How bad does it show? Whatever did become of all my friends?
Whatever happened to the likes of all of them?

My life is a stereo, outphased but you know
60 cycles humming, whatever happened to my friends?
Whatever happened to the likes of all of them?

But I like being here
And I'm all hooked up wrong
