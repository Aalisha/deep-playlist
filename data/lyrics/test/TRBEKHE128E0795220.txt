(Oh yeah)
Oh my God
Look what she's got in her bag
Does anyone know where I can get one of those?

(Vibes)

Instead of just lying there
Why don't you show me that you're powerful?
I, I put in XXX batteries
Just so you'd give me something wonderful
Turn you on

Change you up, fast and slow
'Till I find the frequency I like

(Chorus)
Plug it in give me my vibe on
Give me vibrations
That's what gets my ride on
Gotta have vibrations
Jump on top it, sit right on it
Plug in give me my vibe on
Gotta have vibrations
