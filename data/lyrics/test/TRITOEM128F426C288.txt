Some tough little soldier's on a bivouac
Were playin' stud poker in a mountain shack
But every man put down his hands
When the Captain of the guard gave a sharp command
[CHORUS]
Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out, rosin' up your bow
Johnny turn your back, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the broom around the court room floor
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy
(Interlude)
