We dug these holes we crawled into now they're my home
Now here I can not feel the wind, can't feel the rain or cold
And I believe in gentle harmony
Well how I loathe all this obscenity
Is this the way my life has got to be?
Have I a single opportunity?

Look at me oh look at me is this the way I'll always be
Oh no, oh no
Now I pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to god today's the day
Oh no, oh no
