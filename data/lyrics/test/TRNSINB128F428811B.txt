Zzzz Oooo Eeee Ggggg Iiii Rrrr Llll, Zoe Girl, Zoe Girl, Life, Life, Not just life, eternal life

You know I can't explain this feeling
It's almost like I'm dreaming this reality
You know You give me such a freedom
I finally found the way home
I'm right where I belong
Ever since the day I prayed
You into my heart I placed
Every bit of me into Your hands
Lord, I'm here to stay

With all of my heart
I'm gonna love You
With all of my soul
I'll put all my trust in You
With all of my strength
I'm standing beside You
With all of my everything
I will worship You, my king
With all of my heart
With all of my heart

Oh, Lord, I can't define You
Who am I to know You the way I do?
