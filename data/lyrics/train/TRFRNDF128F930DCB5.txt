I was tripping up and down
All around from town to town
Meeting people of every kind
Some were good or some were bad
Some were happy, others sad
Never know who you will find

Living like a hobo
Like a Spanish lobo
Ibiza is still on my mind
Different places every day
Every time a different way
To choose to be on the loose
I've never met people like my friends from Wonderland
Such a crazy band like my friends from Wonderland

People from Ibiza
Oh, people from Ibiza
Ibiza Wonderland
