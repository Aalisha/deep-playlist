Penance for this breath of black betrayal.
Stoic, famished guard the walls of this scarlet temple.
Awaits to hear the sound of armies marching underground and the screams of
failures conquest.
A wish to waste and rise alone with only the wolves i call my own.

A starving withered statue.
Amidst the ruins you once knew.

Condemned to defend.
The weakened flesh of this facade from all that breathes and lies within.
