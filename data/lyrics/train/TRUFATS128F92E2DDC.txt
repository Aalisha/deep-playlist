It's gonna break you, son, it's gonna rot you through
forget the past and all you ever knew
you've never known such fear, you've never shed such tears
it'll have you wishin' you were never here
Where have i gone, blacked out on my death ride
twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side
where have i gone, blacked out on my death ride
twisted and broken down
All that has been, all that's to be
no tomorrow, the demise of sanity
all that has been, all that's to be
no tomorrow, the demise of sanity
...
