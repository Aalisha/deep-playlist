I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gonna groove from night to day
Gonna blow my money jar
Gonna blow my blues away

I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be right my friend
I'm gonna push it through

Whoa---------yeah
It's Electric-----
It's Electric
Yeah It's Electric------Yeah
It's Electric Whoa--Yeah

I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
