Got a picture of your house and you're standing by the door.
It's black and white and faded and it's looking pretty worn
I see the factr'y that I worked silhouetted in the back.
The memories are gray but, man, they're really coming back.
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl.
Heaven isn't too far away.
Closer to it every day.
No matter what your friends might say.
