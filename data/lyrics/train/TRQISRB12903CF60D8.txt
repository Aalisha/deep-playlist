Lately I have been working overtime.
You've been taking a class at nine,
Even though we've got bill still left to pay,
I think we should just slip away.

I can see you in the sun,
Sippin on that Coke and Rum.
Come on, Girl lets take a ride!
Rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind Surfin in the Wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain,
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the Radio
Free Ballin as we go
We can leave it all behind
