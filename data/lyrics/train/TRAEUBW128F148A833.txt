Years on the run,
Boy I know I can take it,
And now that I'm here,
I know you can't stand the waiting, boy,
Lets say no more games,
No messing with the mind,
Always room for change,
Let's give it one more try...
(Come on lets give it a try)

I got my bags packed baby and I'm ready to go,
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more,
I got My heart back baby and it's skipping a beat,
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be and now I'm ready to be.

If you're good to go,
I'm right here for the taking,
...
