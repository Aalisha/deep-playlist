Hey!

The party's over
You're in the corner
You're all alone for the night
And you pick up a phone
You want me to hold
Well dry your eyes
It's all right
It's all right

See you (get to see you)
Feel you (I get to feel you)
In your dreams tonight
See you (get to see you)
Feel you (I get to feel you)
In your dreams tonight
Dreams tonight

When you're in the room
You're home too soon
You can't get me out of your mind
And you get in bed
You cover your head
My letter to you is signed
