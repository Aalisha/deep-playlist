The devil went down to georgia
he was lookin' for a soul to steal
he was in a bind
'cause he was way behind
and he was willin' to make a deal
When he came upon this young man
sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
and the devil jumped
up on a hickory stump
and said boy let me tell you what
I guess you didn't know it
but i'm a fiddle player too
and if you'd care to take a dare i'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
but give the devil his due
i'll bet a fiddle of gold
against your soul
'cause i think i'm better than you
The boy said my name's johnny
and it might be a sin
but i'll take your bet
...
