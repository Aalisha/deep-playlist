You say you don't have much,
That's okay cause it don't take much at all
You can start right where you are,
It don't matter how small
Oh and you're scared your voice won't ever be heard above the crowd,
Well my friend, here's your chance
To live out loud
Cause a little bit of love goes a long, long way
A little bit of hope can change the day
You could be the miracle that someone's waiting for
All it takes is just one flame
And you can light up the darkest place
Well you'd be amazed,
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
...
