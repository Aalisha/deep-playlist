Be like me, quit your job 
Money don't mean anything much 
I took a means of transport 
Down to your old school 
All the way thinking how 

That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 
That you were once for me 
Like I once was for you 

Around the world they have been told 
She let me down lightly in love 
...
