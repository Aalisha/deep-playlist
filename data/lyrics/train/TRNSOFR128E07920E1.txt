I can see by the hole in your head that you wanna be friends
You're the right one baby

I can tell by the moon in your eyes that you've loved by the tribe
You're the right one baby

Hook you up to the coil of the one who makes time with the sun
And who keeps us pumping
See your mind on the hood of my car, and forever in power
As the world keeps dumping down

We are the only ones

Put the earth in the crook of your arm
Tease it and charm it and watch life spray everywhere

I have something more cosmic in mind
...
