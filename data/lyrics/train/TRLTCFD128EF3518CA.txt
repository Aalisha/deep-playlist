I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl I'm out of my head over you
And I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever, this time I know
And there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is through
Girl I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
...
