Child of a Slave-Ras Shiloh
Ras Shiloh
They celebrate now yeah
They celebrate now
1
Winning without fight is best
Lovers of war will perish
I know
Leadership don't mean damnation
Love don't mean retaliation
If we don't stop the wars
Who's gonna be at fault

Hip hip hooray they celebrate
Eat caviar drink champagne
Hip hip hooray they celebrate
At the death of the child of a slave

Child of a slave
