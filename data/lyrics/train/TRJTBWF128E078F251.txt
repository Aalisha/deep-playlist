What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
Cuz He cares so much for you I

Never in my imagination
Did I ever see so clearly
That someone has so much concern for my life
Dear love came found me
Loved me when I didn't even love myself
I love that it will be there
When there's nobody else
So with my voice
I'll sing this little song of praise
Cuz when I think of all He's done
All I can say

What more can he do
Tell me
What more can he do
He sends loving arms down from the sky
Cuz He cares so much for you I
