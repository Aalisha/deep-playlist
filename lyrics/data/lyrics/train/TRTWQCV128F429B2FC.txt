Well I remember my first day of public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough i did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
And stumbled, my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
and soon it was lunch time
Mom said I should ask about how poor kids there get fed
So i got a book of tickets and a scedule and it read

(chorus)
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of pork and beans
