It's them,
With their babyfeet, hummingbirds and milky ways,
It's them, horde your sea shells,
Blow out the big wick,
It's them, it's them, it's them,

No not your vitamins, or pillow or monicle,
this one's just rightousness half full and logical
meanwell remote absolute, and nowhere to go,
but onward and upward,
clasp crowns ground the heart,
let transmission commence,
hello, goodbye dark,

Really i wonder is this all material,
This can't be heaven, the light is too dull
The first time i spoke must have been

it doesn't look like an ice sculpture... or does it?
if i really payed attention time would move faster and faster,
landscapes and states of nature would gallop and sink before me,
