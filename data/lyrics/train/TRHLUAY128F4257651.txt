Sometime I weep
But weepings not my game
Sometime I cry
But I'm laughing all the same
Sometime I'm blue
But blue is not my color
Sometime I'm green
Green like any other lover
And I never know where to draw the line
And I never see the dangers
And I never know where the boundry lies
But you, you, you
Sometime I'm bitter
taste so bad inside
