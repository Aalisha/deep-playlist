Surely you'll find away to loose the grip and stop the sign
Now play the cards at hand to deal the day of your pretend
Stop and smell the tune of radios lost

Something has called out and punctured my last vein
And when the past fails the winter falls and you'll remain
Run the race well, one jest I just did.
