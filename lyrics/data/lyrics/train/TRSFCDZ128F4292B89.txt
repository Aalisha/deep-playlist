You can't sleep, you're restless
And slightly obsessed with falling too deep
And malfunction, you're a virus
Who's intention is fucking up something
You're a crater
On the face of a problem much greater

It's the violence
Or lack thereof control
Body and soul digging a hole
Is the blood stainless?
Enjoy the pain with accepting your grief
Are you finished?

Dumb fucking question
Don't let yourself fall asleep
Ressurect the intention
Once your vision is now mass-produced
Imagine the insults a blessing
Imagine accepting the truth

Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Just imagine accepting the truth
