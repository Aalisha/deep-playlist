After the lights go down low, baby, you know
there'll be no reason for teasin' me so.
and when the dancin' is thru and folks will be few
i'll be here sittin' with no one but you
and i'll be needin you so after the lights go down low.
i wanna hold you, squeeze you as tight as i can,
i'd like to kiss you, please you and make you understand
and when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine.
together we can have a good time.
