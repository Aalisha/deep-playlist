10, 000 Maniacs
Miscellaneous
Old Mister Time
He looked funny
The children called him the scarecrow
An old raincoat
And baggy trousers and sneakers
he found at the dump
Oh, but if you bothered to look
There was something behind the rags
Oh there was a look in his eyes
It was something you'd never forget

He lived badly
A broken shack on the railway
An old moggy
The only one who replied
When he talked to the walls
Oh we didn't understand
We were fooled by the dirt on his face
Oh we were human then
We were searching behind his disgrace
