See them rule these streets at night
Selling souls and dealing highs
Running with their smoking guns
Talking tough of damage done
Revolution in their minds
Only way they know is crime
Killing children with their fix
While they wear a crucifix

They are the voice
There is no choice

Cities held by strangle hold
How to free them no one knows
...
