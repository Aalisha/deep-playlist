I must have been sleeping
I must have been drinking
I haven't been dreaming about you for years
There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
I was too cool for high school that year
That year

It must have been New Years
No one invited you
You took things too far
But I miss you
And your antics
You were lonesome
And blue eyed
And so special to us
...
