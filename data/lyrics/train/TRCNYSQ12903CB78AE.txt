We drove a hundred miles that day
To see a Halloween parade
Skeletal autumn in Cold Spring

Parents holding hands with Pale Death's infants
Shivering on the courthouse steps in polyester robes
And exposed bone thermals

March them down to riverside square
Your teeth gnash together as you chew an Excedrin

On the way home
The empty parkway wound its way back through charred black pine
...
