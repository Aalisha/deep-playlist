come on, come on, come on, come on!

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man!
Love, didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
Each time I tell myself well I think I've had enough,
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.

I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on
Take it!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby!
Oh, oh, break it!
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby yeah.
Oh, oh, have a!
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby,
You know you got it if it makes you feel good,

You're out on the streets looking good,
