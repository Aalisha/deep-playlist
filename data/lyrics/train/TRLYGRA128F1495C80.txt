I'm feeling sexy
I'm feeling sexy
(rock like this, rock like this)

[Verse 1:]
Saturday & I feel like letting it go
Sho 'nuff I got 'em all lined up in a row
Sunset come & I'm coming to
Now I see you rockin' baby so I'm rocking with you (ahh)
Shout out but I just aint loud enough
I'm trying to touch ya but I can't get close enough
Cross my legs now I'm flirting with you
Got a jones in my bones that's jumping for you (ohhh)
I know you like I'ma give to you
Hooked on the feeling that you putting me through
Taste you can't get enough
Sweetness comes get my love

[Chorus:]
(Uh Ohh)
