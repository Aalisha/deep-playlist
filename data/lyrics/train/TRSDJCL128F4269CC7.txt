Darling, dah-dah-darling
Waltz with me
Darling, dah-dah-darling
Whooo
Darling, dah-dah-darling
Waltz with me
Darling, dah-dah-darling
Whooo
Darling, dah-dah-darling
A sweet tuxedo girl you see
Queen of ball society
Fond of fun
As fun as fond can be
When it's on the strict Q.T.

I'm not too young
I'm not too old
I'm not too timid
Not too bold
Just the kind you like to hold
Just the kind for sport I'm told

Hell's a poppin
When I'm waltzing
In my stockings
Hell's a poppin in the whole wide world

Hell's a poppin
When I'm waltzing
