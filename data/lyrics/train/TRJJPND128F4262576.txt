Force like that fill up in your jaw like the lights
Warlords with the full force
Drugs, a bitch and then it's a war
Run for the rich and give to the poor
We're all telling kids to get the most oil
Bring the cops in the mix
We livin' no more
Won't make your car start
A dark heart
Kill and get your ass caught
You're dead now
It's not a problem
The kids who will not steal
the drugs they don't have
Still just kill
In the ghetto this shit is unreal
Nigga's escorts freak the downhills
Shots be ringing like Chinese bells
In fly females, out flip the Catskills
Madness ain't quittin' until
Your night to see jail
And get the raw meal
Mad Dog fought infinity
Ain't trying to be no public enemy
Outlaw like my nigga Red Dog
Step up, bitch and get rough
Nigga with .44's won't lie
A .45 or higher sport nice
Cruise to try to have a kill for your eyes
Lose your life
It feels so nice
