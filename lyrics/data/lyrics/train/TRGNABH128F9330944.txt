Flesh is all that you want,
it's all that you see in this
crushing game of yours
Life itself never satisfies
you in your twisted act in
this theatre of power

Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love

Can't you see what you're doing
to those who believe in you
...
