I see a boy down on the corner he has nothing to his name
I see the dreams that we can follow and die for just the same
and I see someone I believe in through hard and troubled times
if I ever loose my way yeah you're always a friend of mine

then you step out in the big world take the chances that you can
I see the sweat I see the tears yes, brotherhood of man
and I see someone I believe in through hard and troubled times
if I ever loose my way yeah you're always a friend of mine

then you learned about your people (then you learned about your people)
