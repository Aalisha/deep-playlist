How do you live travelling like this
You laughed too much when things used to be funny
And now it's all a big state of bliss

We had a little party somewhere outside Memphis
We hid a six-pack under the seat
It's never too late to forget

I can see them all standing around the bar
With big crowns of gold on their heads
And they're all blind to who you are
At the Royal Caf√©

If you keep laughing, I'll forgive you anything
...
