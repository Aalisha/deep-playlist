Lead Vocal by Jim

There's a way I've been told
If we walk together
Keeps us from this cold.

On the sidewalks of these streets,
Lie the broken dreams
Scattered at our feet...
Lead me on, I don't mind
I'll come forward laughing everytime
All my friends, they've gone underground
Go underground.

There's a shadow on this land
