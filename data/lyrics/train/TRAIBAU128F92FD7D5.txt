Who, who, who, who, who are you, baby?

Who's that in the corner?
Is a-standing there?
Is a mystery
Who are you, baby?

Where do you come from?
Where do you live?
Where do I find you?
To you my love I'll give

I'm trying to find you
Since I've seen you in my dreams
I wanna know
Are things as they seem?

My heart
Is waiting for you to approach me
My life
Is in need of you so desperately

Who is in the corner?
Who is a-standing there?
Who is a mystery
Who are you, baby?

Ooh, you look so lovely
Ooh, you look so good
I just wanna know
Who are you, baby?
