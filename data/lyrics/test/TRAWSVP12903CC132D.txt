[VERSE]
Can I speak my mind
Something spoken to you
Can I run from the time
Broken lives escaped

Won't you cross the line
There's no turning back
I can show you the way
I will kill my past

[BRIDGE]
I am trying to (I AM TRYING TO)
Getting closer you (GETTING CLOSER YOU)
You are drifting away from me
Once I loved for you (ONCE I LOVED FOR YOU)
I been needing to (I BEEN NEEDING TO)
For I'm not getting trought to you

[CHORUS]
Cause you are
The only sun in me
