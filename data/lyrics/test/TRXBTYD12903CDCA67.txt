Multi billion dollar corporate
Media feeding us
All the lines
That we want to hear
We were all raised on the belief
That we would make it in this world
There's no reason for us to fear

I don't believe in those fairytales
Like the american dream
Where everyone wins
In the end
I've worked hard enough
And i've she'd my tears
Trying so hard but getting nowhere
