Brian McKnight feat. Nelly
All Night Long

(Nelly)
Look
Shit just aint the same
When you slide through (Whoa)
I get distracted every time you in my view (Yeah)
Plus I hear you kinda single right now boo (True)
And I got a perfect spot for a tattoo (Oh)
I get ya name more than once if I have to (Yeah)
Me and you up at a classic then buy you
Cause I got a few places you can fly to
Bring ya partners cause you know I'm bringin' my crew
(Yeah)

(Brian McKnight)
Girl don't you walk on by
We're not leavin' one more time
Shorty's got her back to me
Show me what you got for me
Watch you move from side to side
Lick your lips then close your eyes
Like something from a fantasy
Good for you and good for me girl

So we can talk about the things you want (Talk about the things want)
Or we can talk about the things you like
Girl I don't just talk to hear my lines
You've heard it all a thousand times girl
And we can talk about taking it slow (Takin' it slow)
And we can talk about taking our time
Girl how can I get you in my ride
Who's gonna take you home tonight

Baby let me love you (Baby let me love you)
All night long (All night long)
All night long (All night long)
Baby let me please you (Let me please you, yeah)
