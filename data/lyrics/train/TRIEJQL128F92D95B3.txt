You know the game of love, so the flame never burns you
No passion concerns you, no violins play
But me, I lose control of my heart when I'm near you
That's why I fear you and turn away
I need a love that's true, I wish it could be you
I know it should be you and so I say...

All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
...
