Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Chorus
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
