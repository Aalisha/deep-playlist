Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
In his stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Oh, in the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
