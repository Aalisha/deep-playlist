uuuuh.Baby yeah.ladadada

Take me back to the place where we were free
Didn't have a care in the world you see
All that really matter was
You and me

Time stood still the world was frozen
A pretty pictured love was sculpted
Best friends and lovers till eternity
You and me

But now the seasons changing
Everythings been rearranging and
now your kisses seem so cold
To busy to do the things we use to
It ain't the same anymore

Take me back (ooh)
Take me back to where it was good (ooh)
Take me back to where love was new (oooh oooh)
Take me back (ooh)
