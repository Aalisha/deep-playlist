Once in a while you got a dream to come true
Once in a while you get a rumor of you
I'm dying for you baby and your heaven's touch
Can't do without you cuz you're much too much

You think you're just turning the page
I gotta tell ya that you're shakin' my cage

Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake shakin' shakin' my cage
Shakin' my cage, shakin' my cage
Shake shakin' shakin' my cage

Everybody feels like they got something to do
