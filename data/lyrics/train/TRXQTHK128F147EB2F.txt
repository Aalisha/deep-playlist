Don¡�¯t you know, don¡�¯t you know, don¡�¯t you know
It¡�¯s the real thing, girl


They say it¡�¯s popcorn love
But it¡�¯s more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see


It¡�¯s popcorn love
Every morning, noon and night
Popcorn love


Don¡�¯t you know, don¡�¯t you know
It¡�¯s the real thing, girl


When we go on those special dates
We¡�¯re always holding hands
We¡�¯re never, ever late
You¡�¯re on my mind all the time


I keep thinking (I keep thinking)
Thinking (I keep thinking)
I keep thinking (Thinking of you)

Popcorn love

But it¡�¯s more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see
