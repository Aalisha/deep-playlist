All I ever wanted was to see you smiling

I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me
