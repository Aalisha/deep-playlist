He won't lay a finger on you
He won't wreck your pretty face
But he'll tell you that you're worthless
Just to put you in your place

Well, you don't have to be kicked to be bruised, no
And you don't have to be hit to be abused

Evangeline, you're a hard one
Your denial is bolstered by your dreams
Thinking love is gonna save you
But it ain't love if it's mean, Evangeline

And the smile that you're wearing
...
