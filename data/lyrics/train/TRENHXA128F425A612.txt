You are the one that drew me here
Now that I've come, I find I am no nearer to you
Led by the light so dim, you didn't even penetrate the

Promising all the answers
Knowing I could be captured with the information
Never to radiate the hidden heart or penetrate the skin
Oh winter sun
You're a promise in the distance, winter sun

If I chase the light to find the heat
