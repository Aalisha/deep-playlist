Comes a rain storm put rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm you can get a little heat
Comes love nothing can be done
Comes a fire then you know just what to do
Blow a tire you can buy another shoe
Comes love nothing can be done

Don't try hiding cause there isn't any use
You'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice
