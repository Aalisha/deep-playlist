In the beginning there were problems
There was some regress
But evolution's taken care of what it thought was best
I got so much education that my head's overgrown
But my body's real small from every chemical known

I'm a modern man... I'm a modern man

I got machine that take me every place I want to go
I got machine that tell me everything I want to know
...
