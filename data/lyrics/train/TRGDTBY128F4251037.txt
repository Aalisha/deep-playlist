Our order mocked
And cast aside
This birthright realm, 
To a son of clay
Reclamation of our
Lost prominence
Behold a vacant throne! 

Wretched! Loved by our hate! 
Weeping to a light finally failed
Fall upon our spears
And give praise
We reward faith with
Sanguine blessings
Consent to kneel
And find a winged king!
