There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
'Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl it's a show, let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight, don't say goodnight

Walkin' down the street, keepin' hush, hush on the scene
No one knows you, such a mystery
Opposite of fun 'til you turn the power on
Then you come out turnin' up the heat

Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your roof is on fire, you're losing control
