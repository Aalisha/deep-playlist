System-system-ystem-ystem, System-system-ystem-ystem

System-system-ystem-ystem, System-system-ystem-ystem

Syste-e-e-e-em

In the corner-er, I'm just thinki-ing, what's a girl supposed to do-oo-oo
I love you baby-y from a dista-ance, I've been watching you-ou-ou-ou
All of my friends use a cute li-ine, seems to work everyti-ime
But I can't seem to-oo get through to you-ou, dreamin's all I do

Everybody's got a system, syste-em
Why's mine not workin' on you
If I could make you liste-e-en, liste-en
What've I got to do to prove my love for you

When I see you, wish I could hold you, but I just don't know what to do-oo
