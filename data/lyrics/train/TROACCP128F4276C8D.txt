Sugar and spice
Righter than right
Never had a feeling so nice, no, girl
I wanna tell the world
I found me a girl

Sweeter than sweet
That's how I feel

I found me a girl

I told my baby that I had to get away
And that I'd be back another day
She didn't even ask me where I had to go
She said she didn't need to know, ooh, ooh

Just said she'd miss me every minute of the time
She wrote me that on a valentine
That's how I know that I can't stay away too long
â€˜Cause I'm gonna get myself back home to my

Righter than right (Love affair), said yeah, yeah
Never had a feeling so nice, no, girl
I wanna tell the world
I found me a girl

Sweeter than sweet (Ooh, sugar)
