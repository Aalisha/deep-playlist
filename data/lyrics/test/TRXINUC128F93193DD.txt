From the venues so grand
Back to the slaughterhouse
It's time to face my last stand
The long waited last goodbyes
'Cause it's really been long since I last heard my name
Getting cheered at, not laughed and cursed
Now I can see it
There's nothing left for me anymore, oh

Wake up and see the world has changed
Now open your eyes, lonely rider
Just a puppet in the show
Do the only thing you know
Just crawl to the end of your road

Broken wings
Broken wings
I've lost my golden dreams
I ask you one more time
...
