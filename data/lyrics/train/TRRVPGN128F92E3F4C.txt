Some things are hidden in weird lands
Just like treasures
Volcanic bombs sleeping in your belly.
So innocently and you're their home.
They're ready now, and a strong wind's blowing
On the way down.
All seems to be bigger.
And the way up.
It's a funny picture of me
Loking like a monster.

Upupupside down, oh
Upupupside down, oh
Upupupside down'so lost
Up up up
