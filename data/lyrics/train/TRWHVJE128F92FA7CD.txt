Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs

Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead

Then I'm goin', goin', back, back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots

I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The L.O.X.
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell

Yeah, so when Compton niggaz
And Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne, real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin' it big and don't wanna split yo' wig

I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo'? Fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo'? Niggaz tried to play me, man
Anything you ask fo', all about this Bay game

I'll give you anything you ask fo', money over bitches
