It's raining out again
You look so close to me
I'm holding out my hands
The world is out
The world is out of reach

Here come the boys, boys
Making such a crazy noise
To drown my faltering voice

Here come the boys, boys
By the wall, they're falling in line
To stand against time

And I'm washed overboard, so weary
Stay overnight with me
And I'm washed overboard, so weary
So weary, I could neither cry nor shout
Neither cry nor shout
