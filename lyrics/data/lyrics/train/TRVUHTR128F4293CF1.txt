I can't help but feel a little ill
When I think that you might be
With somebody else
I know that if he's giving you your fill
You won't find the need or time to call me
And I can't help but act a little strange
After all this time we don't mean nothing
You held me close and cried on holidays
Now you don't find the need or time to call me
No you don't find the need or time to call
Don't say that it's not true

Please don't lie to me I wouldn't lie to you
And don't be surprised when we do
Talk like strangers

I don't understand if it is true
It's all in the past now you've forgotten
And if this is all that it means to you
You won't find the need or time to call me
And I won't try to make you feel the same
Pain rolls off you quicker every minute
Now I don't even want to hear your name
Cause you don't find the need
Or time to call me
...
