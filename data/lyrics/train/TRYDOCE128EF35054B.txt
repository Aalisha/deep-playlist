Hello, I missed your call.
You're the one that I always lie about, no one knows that I'm without. It happens every fall.
When the groundwork that we've laid proves it's worth and we get paid again.
8 A.M. all day, from the greybreak in the morning to the grey sunset that's yawning.
All that it can say is to threaten more to bore me and send me to bed early again.
Still waiting in line, nothing much to do. Still far behind, we can only loose.
The list on my hand sprawls, I'll consider something done if I even get to one of them.
