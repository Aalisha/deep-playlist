I think I got a problem, I think I gotta go
Girl, I've liked you for a while, 
And I think it's time that I let you know.

Your face is always in my memory, 
Your looks are stuck inside my head.
I'll take it as a sign; I gotta make you mine, 
I really can't pretend.

Can't seem to get (can't seem to get)
You out of my head (you out of my head)
Can't seem to get (can't seem to get)
You out of my head (you out of my head)
...
