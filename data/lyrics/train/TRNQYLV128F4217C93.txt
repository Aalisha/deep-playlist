The sun sets behind you
And it shines on me too
This view must be the highest beauty
And I know that light will pass
And the dark will fall
But I don't care about that now
No I don't care about that now

The days we spend
Searching, sometimes finding
If we die today, we should die smiling
And I know these times will be gone someday
But I don't care about that now
No I don't care about that now

What we believe, is what we believe
...
