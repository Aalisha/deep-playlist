(Leo Robin/Jule Styne)

A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat or help you at the automat.

Men grow cold as girls grow old
We all lose our charm in the end
But square cut or pear shape
These rocks don't lose their shape.
