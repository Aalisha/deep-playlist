You there the bringer of my despair
You are stagnation of hope and wealth
Oh you personify loss and greed of mine
And you hide until my fear reappears

The love for life once bright
I'm burning fuse the only flame I have
From spiral down the sky
The seed is growing my misery

These wounds have killed time
We struggle to climb
