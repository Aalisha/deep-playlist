Me and Mrs. Jones...
We got a thing... going on...
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now...
We meet every day at the same cafe
Six thirty I know I know she'll be there
Holding hands
Making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song
Me... and Mrs., Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on...
We both know that it's wrong
...
