Hey, man, I don't feel like goin' to school no more
Me neither, they can't make you go, no you daddy, oh yeah

I ain't goin' to school, it starts too early for me
Well, listen man, I ain't goin' to school no more
It starts much, much too early for me
I don't care about readin', writin', 'rithmetic or history

I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
Well, she's the only girl in this whole world who understands me

Well, she's sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
