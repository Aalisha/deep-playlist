Many people tell you that they're your friend
You believe them
You need them
For what's round the river bend
Make sure that you're recieving the signals they send
Cos brother, you've only got two hands to lend

Maybe there's someone who makes you weep
And some nights loom up ahead
When you're asleep
Some days there's things on your mind you should keep
Sometimes, it's tougher to look than to leap
...
