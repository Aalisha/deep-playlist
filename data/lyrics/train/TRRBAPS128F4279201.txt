It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you wanna do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you wanna do
Lord when I was in love with you darling, Long time I didn't love you

Just to make your own paycheck baby
Bring it all home to me
I go out every night baby
And I get all mad about girls I see

It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you wanna do
It's my own fault darling, treat me the way you wanna do
