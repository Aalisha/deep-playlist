There's nobody here
To tell us a joke
We tear off our ears
The fire that we stoke
You wrote me a note
The pages were blank
And I, I should have known
Invisible ink

I know that I am yours and you will be mine
Come and join us in the trenches
Red and purple by our side
Say you'll never leave us
In this company of mine
