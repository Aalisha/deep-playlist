Bow your head and fold your hands,
Master celebrator!
No one gets a second chance,
Master master!

Raise your voice and start to speak,
Master celebrator!
Climb the mountain to it's peak,
Master celebrator

But I don't know, I don't know,
Who knows?
No one, no one seems to do any better,
When they cross the border!
No one, no one seems to do any better,
When they cross the border line!
