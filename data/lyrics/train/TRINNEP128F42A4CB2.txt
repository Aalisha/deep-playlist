(Murs)
I stumbled out of bed, hungover, none sober
Like the Joe's rushed my body and I was the sole cobra
Still a soldier grabbed a soda helped my stomach settle down
Then fell into the shower as to let the funk drown
Put Degree under my arms, turned off the alarm
You only set it to regret it
A million things to do but work is where I'm headed
The dreaded grindstone on the edge of my bed
I sit and let my mind zone on how fun last night was
Started with a light buzz that slowly progressed into a full blown fade
I was trying to get laid, but, got no action
It was back to the crib for personal satisfaction
Triple X, dvd's, I got a whole stack in
Was snapped out of my daydream by something that I seen
I left the tissue full of spunk on the floor by my jeans
It seems I have 15 minutes to make the 20 minute ride it takes to get to work
So I fly out the door while I'm putting on my shirt
Start the car and then I'm off to get in trouble with my boss
He runs his mouth like a bitch sometimes I wish he'd lay me off
So that I could lay him out with one little punch right to his fat ass mouth
But now I'm assed out, 'cause these fools on the freeway
be driving like they ain't got nowhere to go
You know those fucks in the fastlane moving hella slow
Got me yelling at my windshield
Now it's like 10 'till I want to call in
Man I think it everyday but I'm not ballin'
So I got to go get paid and continue the charade of
Customer service since I don't get commission
My efforts seem worthless thanks and have a nice day
'Cause what I got to say even if they were rude
And gave me attitude it's a shame what I have to do to get written fool
