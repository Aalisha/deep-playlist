I'm 21, my life has just begun.
But already i'm in pain.
I feel like i'm insane.
(I feel like i'm insane).
I don't know how i could express myself.
The words are hard to find.
I can not clear my mind.
(I can not clear my mind).

Each night I sit at home,
I can not find an explanation.
What is it about me that is making me stay alone?
