"Hey there love, let's get to catching up
'Cause I been thinking those thoughts that must have slipped my mind
That time that I left you there that night"

I replied "Let me remind you of the guy you failed to mention all along
'Cause your actions have consequences, and these are them"

I'll be your friend in hell
Until then I despise you
And I probably always will
I can't afford to make another mistake like this
'Cause this is more than I can take

I don't mean to leave angry
This is by your own device
I'm sure this comes as no surprise

Hey there babe, don't mean to cut you off
But I've heard enough lies, and you're dyin' to get caught
