The blood has dried and the wounds are high
The scars are settling in
So I keep the light low and they still show
I sit and count every stitch

And what it means, what it really means
It's time I let everything go
That's killing me
And turning me
Spinning me so out of control
I don't want to let go, let go
I don't want to let go
...
