Take another picture today
And save it for tomorrow
A thousand words that we won't have to say, no. 
Another penny for your thoughts
A dollar for your sorrow
It's your silence and that's the price we pay

(Chorus 1)
I can't. I won't. I've tried before
To make believe just a little more
It's killing me from inside
When your souls collide

Leave me hanging by a thread
Am I on the road to somewhere
