Met her boyfriend by the escalator
May the 14th 1978
She drunk his Cola, said “See ya later”
That was their very first date
Spent all summer in the skate city
He was the king of the blacktop
Like Tony Alva in the Lords of Dogtown
Eating chips down the Tottenham Court Road
Smoking menthol fags and dancing to the Buzzcocks
Every Saturday night it would be
All summer long hiding her love-bites
Kryptonics and 360’s

16 years going on 17
Hot summer nights and new scenes
New wave and punk rock music
Come on, baby, lets get to it
