They said love hurts
I wrote that book
I climbed that wall
I had one look
But you just came around to say hello
The streets were filled with guilty hearts
And here was I right from the start
And I lost everything when I lost you

CHORUS
So tell me why-y-y-y
Should I let you go
Give me 20 good reasons
I need to know, yeah

And at that point
There was no pain
...
