He lives on his own
The tv's on loan
He watches old movies
He lives in a flat
The lino's all cracked
But he's got plans bingo

He sings like sinatra with more feel
Plays with his pocket roulette wheel all day
And no one stopped him

He got away
Waited all this time with
All this scratching around
In one place made it just in time
All this talk about luck
