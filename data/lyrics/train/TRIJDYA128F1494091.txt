So I say, these are some serious times
All I can see around us is just violence and crime
Full time for us to centralize, socialize and realize
To let the sun shine throughout everyday

Let the moon shine through the peaceful night
This seven time rise, seven times fall
But I don't really believe in those falling things at all

'Cause life continues as it goes
If you really want to know the truth
The truth is in being told

So I say, these are some serious times
All I can see around us is just violence and crime
Full time for us to centralize, socialize and realize
To let the sun shine throughout everyday

Let the moon shine through the peaceful night
This seven time rise, seven times fall
But I don't really believe in those falling things at all

'Cause life continues as it goes
If you really want to know the truth
The truth is in being told

Some time I think it's peace and safety
