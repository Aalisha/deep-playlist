It's five miles till I see my lover
I guess you could say that she's more than that
I've been sat in this seat now for hours
Reading my book like a map

Yeah these windows are crying
And this train is dying
To meet you

This train is filled with emotions
They all make me think about you
When we pass these old desert stations
I want to go there with you
