Shuffling down the street with his sideways feet,
Stopping now and then and he'll stop again,
No doubt in his mind where he's going

He doesn't care for his hair or his teeth
And if the truth were known he's a bit of a thief,
Innocently lies, and it's showing

Who'd imagine he's man's best friend.
Knowing he's your friend in the end.
Won't be around when you shout or swear
Not very sorry, he doesn't care;
God knows why we call him old faithful
