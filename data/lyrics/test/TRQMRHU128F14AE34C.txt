Dead man, were you ever alive or was I just a seed
Buried deep inside some woman you wed
Right before you crawled out of her bed and crept down the hall?
Did you think of me?

It's just something I'd like to know,
Though I'd still love you if you told me
That you just walked away.

My God, what a world you love!
