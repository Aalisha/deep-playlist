Tonight, we're drunk upon our nostalgia
So raise a glass to the black maria
Through laughter seems to soothe the pain
Of adoring what I violate

I'm sick to death by the irony and all the lies that we create
When we're feigning every red letter day

The chemicals aid in our neglect, feigning all of adoration
Destined it seems for this disease, becoming all I loathed
Feigning all our adoration
