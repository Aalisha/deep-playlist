High and dried, tire rubber starts burning
Fill her up now before the table starts turning
Souped up, jacked up, cracked up, stacked up
Louie's got the gear and Charlie's got his back up

Go, no
And don't it make you feel good?

Says she's a dirt box, you're like a cannibal
Somebody feeds her, sure ain't the state farm
...
