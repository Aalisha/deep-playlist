Be what you wanna be
See what you came to see
Been what you wanna be
I don't like what I see

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, hell within
And you think you have it still, heaven inside you

So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind
I'm just see through faded, super jaded
...
