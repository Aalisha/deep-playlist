If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us
Ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side
I can't lie

Your one vice
It's you're too nice
Come around now can't you see

I want you
All tattooed
I want you bad

Complete me
Mistreat me
I want you to be bad

bad
bad
bad

bad
