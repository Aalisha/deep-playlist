It is not good to travel today
neither to cross the ocean
desert's so dry
water-thirst kill you
Don't good to travel today
neither to cross the ocean
desert's so dry
water-thirst kill you
kill you, kill you, kill you
kill you, kill you
When it wet it slippery, yeah
when it damp it cramp your belly
don't want to see you underground
don't want to see you underground
underground, underground, underground
