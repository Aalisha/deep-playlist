Is it a crime?
For me to be feelin' this way
I'm goin' out of my mind
And there's no change from my runaway love

Is it a dream?
 (Is it a dream?)
That I'm throwin' in the wishin' well
I'm losin' control
Body and soul
(Body and soul)
Standin' here waitin' for a train that may never come

I saw the signs, I'd read the book
I should have had a second look
But, boy you caught me dreamin'
And there were times you'd come around
And we'd agree just to be friends
Tell me who was foolin' who

Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper
