It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe

And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
