We all know the chosen toys
Of catty girls and pretty boys
Make up that face
Jump in the race

Life's a kick in this town
Life's a kick in this town

This town is our town
It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us

This town is our town
It is so glamorous
Bet you'd live here if you could
And be one of us
...
