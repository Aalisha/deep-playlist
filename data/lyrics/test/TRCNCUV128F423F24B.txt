I got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
Got a string around my finger, what a world, what a life,
I'm in love . . .

I got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go,
Anytime I move my finger, lucky me, can't you see?
I'm in love . . .

Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold a string,
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let you go . . .
