Come on, people! Come on, children!
Come on down to the glory river
Gonna wash you up, and wash you down
Gonna lay the devil down, gonna lay that devil down

Come on, people! Come on, children!
There's a king at the glory river
And the precious king, he loved the people to sing
Babes in the blinkin' sun sang, "We shall overcome"

And I got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me to the glory goal
