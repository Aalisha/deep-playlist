Just call my name
And I'll come running
Just call my name
And I'll come running

Ever had a love
That you could call on when you were in trouble
Ever had a love
Who comes to you on the double
There's no need to look no look no further
I'm waiting here for you

Just call my name
And I'll come running
Just call my name
(When life's got you feeling low)
And I'll come running

Never have to fear
That I won't have time for you when you worry
If you need me near
Just call and I'll be there in a hurry
All you have to do is snap your fingers
And I'll appear for you

Just call my name
(Just call my name)
And I'll come running
(Woah sugar)
(I'm gonna be right there for you if you just call my name)
Just call my name
And I'll come running
...
