Well, I see you life and it's blowing away
Just like the storm that will toss you away
Nothing to lose and baby nothing to win
Just living my life until the very end

And you won't see me running away
Not this time, I think I'm gonna stay
And I won't be the one who's crying for you
'Cause it's you who lose
