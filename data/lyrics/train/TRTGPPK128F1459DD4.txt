The red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain
Sure made for one nasty mess
Ah, but we were ridin' high in that old truck of mine
In deep as we could get
Always looking for a rut, tryin' not to get stuck
And slinging that mud everywhere, growin' up down there

Me and my friends where the deep river bends
Had a long rope tied to a tree
Takin' turns on the swing, takin' turns takin' drinks
And I don't mean iced tea
A good buzz later playing chicken with the gators
Way too young to be scared, growin' up down there
