(Denise Pearson)

Wo, ho, oh, oh
Wo, oh, brand new world

Oh, I strike the light
Is it it or me
Everytime I turn around
Your shadow's here
Reach for the phone
Your voice appears
It echoes in my mind
and I just can't see

So burn out the coal
and set me free
'Cause everytime I fight it off
I just see you and me
