The sky is turning and longing for something far away.
The moon’s a tear drop, see slowly as it falls away.
Miles running down a face,
Everything’s bound to change,
It’s bound to change.

Day breaks of tenderness,
So hold me here like this,
So still and quiet as if it might
Keep you happy.
Oh, keep you happy.
Oh, keep you happy.
Oh, keep you happy.
