Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
Pheeeew
Ban Roll On just won't do
I soaked in Clorox bleach
Lysol and Pine Sol too

Yes I admit I've got a stinkin problem
I filled the tub right to the top
I'll start with my Brillo pad
But I don't know when to stop

I wake up and right away
A foul odor hits my nose
What's my sweat glands start to pour
I'll stink from my head down to my toes
