Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah
Hey little devil
Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah
Hey little devil

Hey little devil you're always runnin' around
It's time that someone started bringing you down
There'll be some changes made
Your rovin' days are through
Hey little devil I'm gonna make an angel out of you

Hey little devil you got me all in a whirl
You're a cute little devil and I'm gonna make you my girl
You're out to break my heart
