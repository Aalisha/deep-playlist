Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
Deadbeats it's always the same I've got to play this game

What the hell is this man a phone bill
No way I'm going to pay for this shit
Fuck that man 300 dollars worth of phone sex calls
Who the hell made this man fuck
I got no money I can't pay this
Who's gonna pay for it
I can't be responsible for someone else's phone calls that I didn't make

Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
