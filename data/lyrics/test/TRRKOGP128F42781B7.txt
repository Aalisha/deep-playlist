You may not like the future
And we're not here to preach to you
We'll take you to the killing floor.

You think you want to know me
You think you want to own me
But I have nothing you can buy.

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
Cause I'm the one you love to hate.

You can't fool me
You can't rule me
...
