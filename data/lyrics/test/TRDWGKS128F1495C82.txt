I used to be daddy's little girl
To us you meant the world
And oh, how we seemed so happy
Thought we had everything
But oh how the season's changed
When you broke up with us and made a new family

So many times I cried
Sleepless nights
Asking why
Did you go?
I still don't know
What happened to the main I used to know?

You loved me then left me out here with no daddy
No longer a family with daddy
Though we struggled for a while
We still made it through these trials
I don't think back because we're ok
Oh daddy
