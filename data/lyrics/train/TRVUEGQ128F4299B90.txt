Deeper than deeper was my love for you
Sweeter than sweeter joy
Hoping that every day, you can go your way
I cannot hold you down

Turning the situation 'round a little more
Making it look like things are just fine
You can go your way
Shudder to think these words were mine

Touching the place, that makes it a love thing
Straight to the face, one way love would be a miracle
Touching the place that makes it a love thing
