It's dark outside, I'm riding alone
But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road
A little scared, but I know where to go
Cuz I know the road
I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road

Hold on--a fork in the road
Life in transition
Hold on--moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on--gotta feel the road
Know my position
