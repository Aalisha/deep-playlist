Ruby said you getting a sin of world of hurt
Down below the mason dumb ass lined the food gets worse
I can't go back to Tennessee
That Nascar country's not for me
Go on if you think you must

Carlos packed his drums up in the darken night
Ruby standing just outside the front porch light
Chain smoking camel straights
The sky off to the east got grey
And he rolled off in a cloud of dust

In a grey coat nicard at the gate, she said,
"You're right it's getting late
You and me got work to do
We can't be burning day light too

She took down the long laid rope
And stayed off that slippery slope
Now Aspen trees were turning gold up top
The talk was buzzing round the beauty shop

Wasn't he barely half her age
Well that's how they do nowadays
We should have all been so lucky

By spring she had the run of the free born men
Ruby turned 50 in a sheep camp tent
Her body still could rock all night
But her heart was closed and locked up tight

But Teddy feels all muddy and brown
The gossip long such quieted down
After one more Cogans test
Pouring coffee for the county vet
