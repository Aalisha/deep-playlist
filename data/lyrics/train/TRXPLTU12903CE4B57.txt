I had a girl she was just that kind
I thought I would make her mine
But when I looked the matter through
She was the worst of kind

She ain't no good
Oh, she ain't no good
When I come to find her out
I found she was no good

(Instrumental)

Some men likes the country girl
Mine's gonna live in town
A town's girl will be lovin' you
When the country girl messes around

She ain't no good
...
