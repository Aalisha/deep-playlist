I love her for the hope she gives
That perfect girls still exists
If L.A.'s defined as a state of mind
Just let the fantasy persist

She pretty, pretty famous
She's so bad and she's so good
She's so ha, ha, Hollywood
If we fall in love, well, who could blame us?
She's pretty, pretty famous

As I'm drifting off to sleep
