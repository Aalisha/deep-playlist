Take a little time for sunshine, take a whole lotta time for love
Take time to praise and thank heaven up above
Take your life as it may come, cuz boy it'll be gone soon
Take a little time for howlin' at the moon

Somebody said, keep your eyes open, gotta keep your feet on solid ground
Gotta take time to take a real good look at everything you've found
Take your life as it may come, cuz boy it'll be gone soon
Take a little time for howlin' at the moon

Take a little time for sunshine, take a whole lotta time for love
