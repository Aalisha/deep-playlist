He starts tellin me the stories of the glories of his past,
But he always saves the story of his Corey for the last.

And he says my Corey's coming
No more sad stories, coming.
My mid-night, moonlight, morning glory's coming, aren't ya girl?
And like i told you, when she holds you, she enfolds you in her world.

I was quite surprised to find out all the places that he knew.
And so i asked the towns folk if his stories were true.
"Well," they said, "old john was born here, hes lived here all his life.
