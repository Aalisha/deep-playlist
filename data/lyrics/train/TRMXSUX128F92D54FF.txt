I've been trying for days to think of a way
To find the words to make sense of how we behave
This might take a while, so please just hear me out

You know how things can get crazy when we go ablaze
We just get carried away
Believe me, I know
Don't even say a word, now please just hear me out

[Chorus]
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

Sometimes the stunts that we pull don't even make sense
But I was never the one to feel the resent
This ain't 'bout who's to blame, so please just hear me out
