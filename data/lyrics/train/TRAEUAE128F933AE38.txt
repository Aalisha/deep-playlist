My mamma done told me
When I was in pigtails
My mamma done told me, Hon
A man is a two-face
He'll give you the big eye
And when the sweet talking's done
A man is a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night

Now the rains a-fallin'
Hear the trains a-callin', whooee!
Hear the lonesome whistle
...
