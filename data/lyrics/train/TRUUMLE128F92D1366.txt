Free my mind
Heal my scars
Erase the past
Dark days to forget
And memories to last
In my heart

Free me now

Make me forget
And forgive
There's no use
To go on and live
Show me a way
To the sun

Heal my scars

Nothing will be forever gone
Memories will stay and find their way
What goes around will come around
Don't deny your fears
So let them go and fade into light
Give up the fight here

Let my eyes take in
The beauty that's here
That's left on this earth
My ears long to hear
...
