A girl from our city went missing from her home
People left their houses people left their homes
He was not invited when he went into her room
He wanted it now she wanted it soon
He'd love to make her?
But when she told him no he foresaw her lucky smile

He knows she'd given him all the signs
He knows she'd given him all the sounds
He knows he didnt have that much time
He knows until the body was found
