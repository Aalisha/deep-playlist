I give part time help
I'm the odd job man
I can't do what I want
So I do what I can

And I'll tell you now
So that you will understand
You get just what you pay for
From the odd job man

One day this dude drives in the station
And I slide out to the pump
And he says, " I need some odd jobs done
Can you get off from this dump?"

Well, I can always use some extra bread
So I nod and take the job
When he says, "Clean up before you come
I do not hire slobs "

Now you can see I'm not no fancy pants
But everyone has pride
And especially since this lovely lady's
Sittin' by his side

Still something keeps my trap shut
And I nod again, " Alright "
And he gooses his Mercedes
And he squeals off in the night

I give part time help
I'm the odd job man
I can't do what I want
So I do what I can

And I'll tell you now
So that you will understand
You get just what you pay for
From the odd job man

Well, I find his place next morning
It's more a palace than a pad
And it kind of makes my pick-up truck
...
