You laughed with me, I laughed with you
You said that you already knew
You looked at me, I looked at you
And there was nothing I could do
What to do, after all you put me through

Ooh Â– ooh, ooh, ooh
You're hypnotic when you touch
Your hypnosis is too much
And you burn me with your hypnotistic fire
You're hypnotic when you feel
Your hypnosis is too real
And I hope you're not a hypnotistic liar
