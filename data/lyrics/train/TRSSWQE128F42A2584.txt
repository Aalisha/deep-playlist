ohh
Why should I care if you
Found somebody new
And you look like you're in love

And why should I care if she
Looks a lot like me
And she's all you've ever dreamed of

I didn't care enough to keep you around
So tell me why should I care now

I was the one who let you go
I never told you that I loved you
I couldn't promise anything
