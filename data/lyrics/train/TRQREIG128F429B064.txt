They call this the badlands baby
But it used to be bayou
The shore of an inland sea
And I can hear you coming

What foul beast stalks this way

The night is dim
But I catch the scent of your arrogance

As you rear your head
I can see your eyes gleaming
Catching light from the moon
Like a pair of knives to cut me down
...
