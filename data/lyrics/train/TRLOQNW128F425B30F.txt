[Verse 1:]
Let Them Stay Local While Im About To Hit Japan
The G4 Get Me Out When I Get In A Jam
You Gotta Go Internatonal To Get With Cham
Women On Your Phone I Bet You Switchin Up Yo Plan
Let Them Other Rappers Beef While They Arguein
Will Be Runnin In With The Bags To Get The All The Grams
Take It Out Yo Hands(Take It Out Yo Hands)
Money Talks, Only Language That I Understand
I Heard That Puff N Jay Were Worth Over 300 Mill
That Means That This Year I Gotta Put It In 300 Gear
You Wanna Treadmill Homie
You Just Runnin Still
Yes This Is The Rap That All The Other Rappers Love To Feel
I Got The Plaque But Now Im Back For The Reload
We Know While Imma Still Stick To The Street Code
