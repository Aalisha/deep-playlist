Eminem]
Yo. I dedicate to this. to yo.

{*imitating Slick Rick*}
To all my fans, keepin y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go f--- himself
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin
which I create, cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I.

{*rapping normally*}
. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you (boy)
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew (c'mon!)
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
and said, "Heck, country western rap records are good!"
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (haha)
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some f---in old fart in a chair
sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your f---in chest 'til your heart kicks in gear (bitch)
And f--- your underground buddy's nameless crew
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too

[Chorus 2X: Eminem *sung*]
You just a. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along
and the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you)

[Eminem]
Yo. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
to the rap you wrote, your f---in answer back's a joke
And I'ma tell these motherf---in fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
like I ain't notice you? BITCH, I had a show to do!
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your f---in mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherf---in DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as f--- cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
quicker but never last, and Everlast is a.

[Chorus]
Aight listen (look)
So this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, WHOOP HIS ASS
