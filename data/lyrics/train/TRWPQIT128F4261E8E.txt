Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, herb mcgruff, buddah bless
Big twan, killa kam, trooper j, and mike boogie
And i'ma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my smith-wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap new york rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than cali, wicked like harry
And fuck sally, I rather marry halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
N.o. rated, rappers you no-made it
Tell the terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the mc in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm herb mcgruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every word is ruff
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
Mc's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a afghan cab driver
