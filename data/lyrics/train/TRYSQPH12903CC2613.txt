I made her from pieces of stars
The ones that fell when you shot through
A sky that burned not to return
No other element would do

Her soul was grown in the bathroom
Her heart is just a red balloon
I gave her lips from wild orchids
When she came out of the cocoon

Not the real thing
Not the real thing
Not the real thing

I can barely see the sun
Now it's blue
I can barely see the sun
Because she kisses like a prototype
