Your mum thinks you're sad
That you're living alone,
And your friends think if you're sad
You should call them more.
But the truth is
That you never needed someone to comfort you
Oh you've never needed someone to comfort you.

But you're no god, you're no god.
And you will never leave this place,
And you will always feel alone,
And you will never feel quite clean
In this new skin that you have grown
Until your old and broken bones
