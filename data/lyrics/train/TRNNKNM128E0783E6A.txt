Yeah, yeah, yeah, you talk too much shit
You know niggaz always talkin bout bitches ain't shit
Money over bitches
We give all our money to the bitches any fuckin' way
I love my bitch, so I'ma send some love out to the bitches, holla

Shit, here's somethin' to remember
When we met that day in September
But, you've been gone since November
Had to finish out yo' last college semester

Her major, brokerage investor
She probably go broke tryin' to invest her
Time and money in somethin that she call love
'Cause, she love fuckin' with thug niggaz

That alwasy get high and had to be drug dealers
Eventually, she hooked up with some hood bitches
The hood bitches turned her on to strippin'
Now the, gettin' is good and it's well understood

That money on the wood can make things get harder
Be glad I'm not a pimp, if I was I'd charge ya
But for all that you go through, just thought I'd let you know
Hoes need love too, I'm fuckin' witchu

Niggaz need to read the manual
To separate your housewife from a hoe
'Cause there's no rules to this shit here
Am I makin' myself clear?

What she don't know won't hurt her y'all
So keep big pimpin' on the low
'Cause there's no rules to what I do
And I know, hoes need love too
