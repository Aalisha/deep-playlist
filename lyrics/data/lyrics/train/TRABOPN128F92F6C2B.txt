Stay a while and work it out of me
We got time and we can cast it true
Just give me a sign, I'll take your word
I'll learn anything you want me to
That is all I'm looking to you for
All I'm asking that you simply do
Take it leave it, make things matter
Yeah take all my breath away
Take it all apart and put it back
I am always left there looking at you
