Do I really need a reason?
Is it really such a big deal?
It just seems like the right situation
To say how I really feel

I love the way that you look at me
'Cause I can't stop looking at you
Ooh, and the sweetest thing that you do for me baby
Besides the little things that you do

Well, if the world don't feel like turning
And the sun just wants to hide
All the stars come out to remind me
