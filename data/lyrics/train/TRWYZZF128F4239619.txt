The proud expectant parents
And their wondrous offspring
A fascinating girlfriend
With good teeth and prospects
A country's occupation
Once deemed shocking is now thought as awesome
And intelligence is gathered
By those that clearly have none

I'm tired of this vanity, importance
I opt out
They dare to call this progress, keeping order
I opt out
