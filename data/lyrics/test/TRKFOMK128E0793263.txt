Robertson

I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
'Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bedÂ ?'
He just grinned and shook my hand, 'No' was all he said.

Take a load off, Fanny, take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny and you put the load right on me.

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said 'Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said 'I gotta go but my friend can stick around'.
