So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
