Hey!
Well I got a time to kill and spines to chill
As you face that grave you must fill
No salvation can stand my frustration
Burning tough in a fiend aggression
So you say: "Is it your hate? You know it ain't too late"
But I guess you can't change your "fate"
It's sold, lost and foretold
So die my friend
Yeah, burn, baby, burn!

We're the aces reflecting death in dying faces
Raising Cain
Yeah, you know you're racing Cain
Heaven turns, explodes and burns
Come on it's Firefall!

Razor's race
Velocity of death and bloodstained wrath
