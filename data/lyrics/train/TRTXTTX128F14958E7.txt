Are you ready for attack?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Stargate ah yeah
Yeah etc
Five have been around and livin' it up
We're changin' it around just keeping you right
When we get excited no we never stop
Everybody knows we can't get enough
People say we're dark but we're the light
'cause we're the only ones that are keeping you tight
Everybody's gonna feel high tonight
Five's gonna show you how to rock it right
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tonight
