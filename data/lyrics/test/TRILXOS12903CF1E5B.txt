Breath the air of the dawning winds
Awakening the process
Of unpure procreation
Born to this world to cause your destruction

Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
Blasphemy reigns unchallenged

They brought plague with their crusade of faith
Murdered and tortured the ones who spit upon the cross
Crimson seas for the name of your lord
Your time has come as we march into his kingdom

Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
Listen to our legion... Chanting thy name
In the name of torment... We reign supreme

Ageless and obscure
Feel the burning in my heart
My eyes have seen the truth
Now my hands will tear your fucking god apart

In the name of Satan
Our hate consumes the heavens
Decimate the holy land
For pain is now your savior

Look into the eyes of the devoted and weak
...
