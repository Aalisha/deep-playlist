Trouble with a capital T, "Tie him down" they said, But tired ain't for me
Let this one fly...

I wonder what they'll make of me, When i'm good and gone in song
In God's country
Let this one fly...

Off on a merry way, Often in a lotta days, Lost on yer merry way
Cause unrevealed and never known... And never known...
