Sprinkle patterns in your daydreams, the world seems so much brighter 
 You've only seen them once or twice but you wonder what's inside them 
 
 Your dream could come true, you know, just test the water 
 Before you heave your boots and go, you better think this over 
 
 God bets you leave them, God bets you lie 
 God bets you never get another chance, God knows why 
 God bets you leave them, God bets you lie
