Well, you can call out the sheriff and the highway patrol
'Cause there's a fool on the road careenin' out of control
Hard liquor, fast women, I just can't let him be
Lord, I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me

Well, I keep my motor runnin', got my beer on ice
And my idea of heaven is a pair of dice
Seven come on eleven, set this poor boy free
Lord, I wish hard livin' didn't come so easy for me
