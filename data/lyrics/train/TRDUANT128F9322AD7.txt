This is how I feel
This moment
This is how I feel
Right now

Don't know what will be tomorrow
Take it all the way
Take it all the way

I'm on the ladder
The sun is shinin'
And nothin' stands in my way
I say goodbye to the fear
Goodbye to the fear

And it don't matter, I need remindin'
Come with me, don't be afraid
And I know just why I'm here
Know just why I'm here
...
