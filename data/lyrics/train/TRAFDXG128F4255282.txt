(Juicy J)
At the Dub we gettin buck
Comin like a lightning struck
Cockin back the chrome at the?
Bitches say I'm fakin it
Players playa hatin it
We can trade words or get in some gangsta shit
Aint the type of nigga that be comin up and then fall
Keep a couple of nines in my drawls when im at the mall
When I'm at the club in the tub for a rub a dub
Even at the church cause?
True to the ground yea I'm down for my fuckin crown
