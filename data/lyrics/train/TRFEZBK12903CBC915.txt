I look at them shuffle
And-a shuffling down
Rambling and scrambling
And heading for town
A hustle and a bustle
And a-buzzing around
Happily awaiting at the station
I look at that train number 709
Huffing, a-puffing, arriving on time
Who do you think's about to arrive
The band they call the Dixieland Five
They're gonna play
That muskrat ramble tune
The way you never heard it played
