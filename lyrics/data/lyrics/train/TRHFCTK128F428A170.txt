Giant steps are what you take
Walkin' on the moon
I hope my leg don't break
Walkin' on the moon

We could walk forever
Walkin' on the moon
We could be together
Walkin' on, walkin' on the moon

Walkin' back from your house
Walkin' on the moon
Walkin' back from your house
Walkin' on the moon

Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walkin' on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walkin' on, walkin' on the moon

Some, may say
I'm wishin' my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay
Some say
Tomorrow's another day
You stay
I may as well play

Giant steps are what you take
Walkin' on the moon
I hope my leg don't break
Walkin' on the moon
...
