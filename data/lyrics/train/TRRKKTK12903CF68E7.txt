No more lies with violent ends
No more fakes disguised as friends
No one has the time to waste on them

I want you to know
It's something that I feel
It's deep inside of me
A part of you as well, understanding

And slips so far away
And sometimes I can't deal
Don't have the time for someone else's scandal
My own life is hard enough to handle

No more lies with violent ends
No more fakes disguised as friends
...
