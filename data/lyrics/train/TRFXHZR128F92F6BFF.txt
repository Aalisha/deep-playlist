My kisses wake her in the night
When she turns I'm not there
I wouldn't have left if I had known
that she'd be left all by her lone
It took my breath when she was mine
I wish my hands could turn back time
And now she can't believe I'm gone
She still thinks I'm coming home

[chorus]
She thinks I'm coming home (x4)

I wanted you to be my bride
