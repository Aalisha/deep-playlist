She's dressed to kill in a dress that he bought her
She wouldn't care if he walked in and caught her
She's come to dance, a dance or two and do
No tellin' what by the time the night is through

She found out the hard way about him
Now she's out to find out how she'll do without him
Her hands are shaking, her heart's pounding
And by the way she's drinkin', his memory's drowning

She's not the cheating kind
She's been cheated one too many times
She's never fooled around
He's still lyin', she's through cryin'
She's not fooling now
...
