Hazy prospects, londing for established order
The valleys are calling, fallen into oblivion
To reign and flourish at own environs
No settled conceptions, defined to earthly criteria

Shrouded in mystery, considering the return
To the depths, where the quick won't be allowed
Taken possession of souls and lost spirits
The evil task is fulfilled, needless to prolong the stay
