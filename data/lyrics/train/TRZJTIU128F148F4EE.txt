I should'a known better
Should'a seen right thru
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise

Don't wanna hear no lies- no apologies
...
