Baby, it's over

Tryin' to forget about
Ordinary things, typical, predictable
Baby, I knew the end before it started

You got me feelin' like I owed you something
'Cause you were there at times when I had nothing
But you threw it all away with the shady things you do

Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say and what I'm about to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you

You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now

You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now

I ignore my intuition and pass it off as a suspicion
