Wouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, okay

Baby, baby, I’ve got this feeling in my soul
If you don’t love me would it be fair
Use my love and give yours to another
Wouldn't that be fair

I can hide all of the misery and pain
I am sure I will never love this way again
Wouldn't that be fair
Do you think she would care

Wouldn't that be fair
Wouldn't that be fair
...
