I can't keep pacing
I need your blood tonight
(you're so far from me)
and i'm so weak inside
come fly to me, i'll show you what it's like
(when the full moon shines)
we'll stop hearts together

when we're conjoined at the lips
i feel alive, i feel undead
pumping new life through these veins
holding onto the finest thread

take my hand, grip it tightly(don't let go)
...
