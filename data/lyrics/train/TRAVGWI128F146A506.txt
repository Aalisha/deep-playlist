They don't ask 'cause they know I'll say
It ain't nothin', just another woman done walked away
Still on track, no, I ain't phased
I rock on all night long, just playing this masquerade

I got everybody thinking, I'm Superman strong
But that big ole "S", ain't on my chest

At night when I get home
And one look at my reflection and lone is all I see
I can tell 'em all that I'm glad you're gone
...
