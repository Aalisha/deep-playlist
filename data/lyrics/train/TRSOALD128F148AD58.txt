There's no doubt you're good lookin', I'll say
And know I see you're lookin' my way
Say you wanna get to know me better
Show me you're side of town

I feel it when we're walkin', and I know
You're not just tend to talkin', oh no
I don't want to lose this new thing
'Cause it could be a good thing, hello

Don't say you love me
'Cause I feel it too
But I don't think I'm ready yet
To make that move
