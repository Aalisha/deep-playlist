I have this fantasy you come back and you forgive me
Oh
I'm sorry now.
I hear this melody
our tryst in rhapsody
And I'm listening.
I never thought I'd see the day when you and me
We'd be so far apart
and I miss you so much now.
But I know there's no way back yesterday.
I will be with you
you're here in my heart
But if you never come back again
we'll never be far apart.
