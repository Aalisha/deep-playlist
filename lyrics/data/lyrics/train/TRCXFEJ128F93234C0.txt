She's got to find a boyfriend, she's working on a movie
Kissing at the premier they'll never see through me
He's got to start to mingle, he's working on a single
Got to get his drugs out, tried to knock a bouncer out

Oooooooooh follow the formula!
Oooooooooh follow the formula!

Got to slag a bands tunes, albums coming out soon
Labels gonna drop them if it doesn't go platinum
She's got to learn to chit chat before she walks the red mat
Doesn't have to talk talk when she's on the catwalk
