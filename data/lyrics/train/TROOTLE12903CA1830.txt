He is coming back...
Another body another face but same soul
His former life is filling up with hate and pain
Many people dying through his hands
Uponing to tortured

Uponing to tortured
And agonized with blood
The calling was to the dead ones always ahead

After the death given a new life
The punishment you taken for mistakes
His old corpse is rotting away
And smelling decomposed
...
