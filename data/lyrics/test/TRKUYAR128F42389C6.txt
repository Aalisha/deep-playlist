Mi seh one ting Nancy kyaahn understand
One ting Nancy kyaahn understand
Wha mek dem a taak bout mi ambition?
Seh, what makes dem a taak bout mi ambition?
Some a dem a aks mi weh mi get it fram
Some of them ask me where me get it from
A chuu dem nuh know it's fram creation
A chuu dem nuh know it's fram creation
Bam bam, ey, What a bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'Ey what a bam bam, said what a bam bam

This woman never troubled no one
I'm a lady, I'm not a man
MC is my ambition
I come from nice up Jamaica
So bam bam, what a bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'Ey a mi seh what a bam bam,
Tell 'em said what a bam bam
