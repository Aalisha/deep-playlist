Well, I been drinkin' again
And I know it's a sin
But I just can't refuse an old friend
'Cause life is gettin' me down
And I been two times around
And there ain't nothing but pain around the bend

I'm not made for the time
I'm born in the wrong century
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years, I have used all the tears in my eyes

Now this old world is a fright
You know my future ain't bright
And I'd just crawl in a hole if I could
...
