Drones
It is foretold: Battles favor honest men
Wake up, this is fucked
There will be no reward in believing there is time to reform the masses or salvage the truth

Fear is a monster that feeds on conjecture
Dulled by design; the world's greatest war is waged on your mind
Fear is a monster that feeds on conjecture
Time is a bastard that lives for disaster
