8...7...6...6...6...5...4...3...2...1...

I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer

A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
