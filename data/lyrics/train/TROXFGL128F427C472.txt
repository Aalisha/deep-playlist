Sometimes I get upset
When people treat me bad
I don't have time to think
And so I get real mad

I pull my hair
And find somewhere
That I can be alone
But when I do I think of you
And then I hurry home

Where I got chores to keep me busy
A clock to keep my time
A pretty girl to love me
With the same last name as mine

And when the flowers wilt
A big, old quilt to keep us warm
I've got the sun to see your blue eyes
And tonight you're in my arms
...
