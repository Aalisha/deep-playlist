Nellie the elephant pack her trunk and
said goodbye to the circus
of she road with a trumety trump
trump trump trump
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk
and trumbled of to the jungle
of she road with a thrumety trump
trump trump trump

Nellie the elephant pack her trunk and
said goodbye to the circus
of she road with a trumety trump
trump trump trump
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk
and trumbled of to the jungle
of she road with a thrumety trump
trump trump trump

To Bombay
A travelling circus came
They brought an intelegent elephant
and Nellie was her name
One dark night
she slipt her iron chain, and of she ran
to Hindustan and was never seen again

oooooooooooooooooo...
