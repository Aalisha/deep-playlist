will He kiss her on New Year's Eve
after the last guests leave
then kiss her again, will He
peek in the mirror while She

knowing He's watching her tease
stripping the gown with ease
bare as the New Year She
so in love with her is He

slipping into her dreams
rocking her gently to sleep
hale as the dawn is He
...
