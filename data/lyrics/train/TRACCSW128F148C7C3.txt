Uhh, c'mon yeah *laughter*
Brooklyn, Brook-lyn, take it back, take it back
If I... Fox Boogie, ragtop six drop
Get caught, think not, light Brown
Cause we're not to be stopped
If I...

I came up fast in this crap game they call a rap game
What the damn she's killin it again from that dame
Now every snake fake-faced O jig
I'm like, just don't sell me the 'Bridge, I buy lakes
Friends even bend rules, chicks I lent jewels
Says, "She's actin funny now, oh she's got money now"
Tryin to do my thing y'all, need you on my team
But you aint gon' stop my dream, or block my cream
I liked things better when you called me Ings
A year before Rap City, way before Screen Scene
'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was
The first to keep it real wit all my secrets concealed
Things got ill the minute I got a deal
And my time got shorter and you was havin a daughter
Had to stop hopscotch, get off Iran
Damn I wish we were still playin jump
