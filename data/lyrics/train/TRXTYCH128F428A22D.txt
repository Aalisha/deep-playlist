See my eyes turn from blue to red
Do you realize what you said
You don't know me and you don't know me
I can't hear you well I forgot your name

Stop pretending that you care
I could always see through thin air
Say you love me but you don't even know me
I can't hear you I forgot your name

Well it's a shame
Yeah a shame
I have to see your face again
