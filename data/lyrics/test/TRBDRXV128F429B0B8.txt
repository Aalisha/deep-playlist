Rain falls down in concentration
I finally come to the realization
That this place I'd once forsaken
Will consume my generation
Countless, endless summers
Opposing everything we've worked for
It was foolishness that made us wish
We could trade it all away
But that was years ago he shrugs
Back when we smiled and tipped our mugs
A time when boys were men
Friends never stood alone
Do you remember when I said
I'd never walk this town again
