You're the man with no choice
Yes it's been decided you've done wrong
And their's no single voice
That will stand up and say
Oh just what has he done?
For they all read the news
And it's surely proof enough for them
And they flatly refuse to consider oh
Was he really to blame?

Cause when the fingers point... whoah
It's too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
Too much to take
And when the fingers point... yeah
It makes your heart break

Now you're moving away
For you can not take it anymore
No amount of explaining can alter the truth
