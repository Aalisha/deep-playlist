It's all love

I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
Only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
Curried Falafel, barbecued Tofu

No fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
Only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
Exercising daily to stay healthy
And I rarely drink water out the tap, 'cause it's filthy

Lentil soup is mental fruit
And ginger root is good for the youth
Fresh veg-e-table with the ital stew
Sweet yam fries with the green calalloo

Careful how you season and prepare your foods
'Cause you don't wanna lose vitamins and miner-ules
And that's the jewel
...
