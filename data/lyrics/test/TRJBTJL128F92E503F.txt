I'm feelin' like I got the world in the palm of my hand,
It's like I'm with you and nobody else is here, yeah.
Me and you in here together, a perfect effect.
Just come a little closer oh oh oh yeah yeah

Oh, talk to me and feel the music.
Bring yourself tonight,
Oh, just do whatcha want, whatcha want like nobody's watchin'
Do whatcha want, whatcha want keep the party rockin'
What, what, what keep it up, like nobody's watchin' you,
Oh yeah ohh,
The rhythm's calling you, oo, come and ohh
The rhythm's calling you.
