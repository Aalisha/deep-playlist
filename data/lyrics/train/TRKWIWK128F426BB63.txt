Don't know what come over me,
Done lost my self control;
He's the sugar in my tea,
The jelly in my roll!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Gee, I've got a lovin' man,
One o' them handsome brutes,
He's built 'ccordin' to a plan,
Too bad when it suits.

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

I can't sleep a doggone wink
Unless he's by my side;
Mind's so different I just can't think
...
