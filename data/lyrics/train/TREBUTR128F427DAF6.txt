[B.G.]
Say, Weezy (weezy)

[Lil' Wayne]
Can... they remember... me?
Lil' Wee... zy

[B.G.]
Make 'em remember (Haaa!) ya, nigga
Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!
Let 'em know how you've been for a while

[Lil' Wayne]
All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Had ta struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks. under they dress
Them niggas there with me fooli'
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my brain
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs
Guns up in my trench
When niggas playin', they get drenched
My pockets is full of lead
So, nigga, stay off tha ben
I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb
So I'on't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb
And wet dem niggas' shirt
