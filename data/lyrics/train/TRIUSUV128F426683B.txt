I Didn't Mean To Break Your Window, I Was Tryin' To Wake You Up
But When I Saw You Out Last Night It Hit Me Like A Truck
I Tried To Call All Day At Work, Didn't They Give You My Fax
Hey I Want My Goodbye Back

I Had A Momentary Temporary Lack Of Self Control
I Said This And I Said That, I Was Really On A Roll
It's Been Downhill Ever Since My Good Sense Jumped The Track
And I Want My Goodbye Back
