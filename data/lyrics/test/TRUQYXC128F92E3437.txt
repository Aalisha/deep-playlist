(Florrie Palmer / Tony Ashton)

Tropical summer, balmy day
Sit around you haven't much to say
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.

You know you're in the hands of fate
Now you've gone and found me you appreciate
That the heat is on,
The heat is on.

You're on the road to Mandalay
Never gonna make it try another day
'Cos the heat is on,
The heat is on.
