Baby, I know I've told you
But I ain't told you today
Since you walked in with that sleepy eyed grin
There's something I've been meanin' to say

I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you

When you pencil in on your makeup
When you're rubbin' it off at night
Wrigglin' out of them jeans while you're gigglin' at me
Ay, no mistakin'

I like the way love looks
The way it looks on you

Lyin' on the very next pillow
...
