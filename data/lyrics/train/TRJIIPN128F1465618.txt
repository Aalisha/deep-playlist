(ooll)
(ooll)

Oh yeah
Yeah yeah

Phone rings at a quarter to nine
Some crazy girl is on the line
Talkin' bout how I better recognise
Found my phone number in his Calvin Klein's, and I'm like
What's that gotta do with me?
Your man is the one who needs questioning
'Cause there ain't nothing that you're gonna achieve
By calling me and giving me the third degree

And if he's your man then tell me
Why was he sweatin' me?
All up in the club last night
Telling me I'm the type of girl he likes
But you say you don't believe (don't believe)
He was acting that way
Girl I wish you could have seen
How your man was shakin' me

CHORUS:
Girlfriend
Let me give you somethin'
I know that you love him
But you should have saw him last night
You ain't his girlfriend
Anymore than I am
I know you see him
But girl you really should have saw him last night

Oh no, no you didn't say
...
