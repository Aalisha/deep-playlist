Coloured photographs
Edges for the back
Petals for the den
Signs are withering
And water to your knees
I feel like diving in
Rising is just a line between you and I

I'll wait it out
Until you don't want me
You don't want me to
But I'll wait it out
Until you don't want me
You don't want me anymore

There's something in your eyes
The way you tell it every time
