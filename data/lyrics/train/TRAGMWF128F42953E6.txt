Hey!

Got my life worked out 'cause I was born a methodical man
Now that I'm all grown up I wanna put you in my master plan
If you turn me down, no problem at all
I've got a backup system and a failsafe wherewithal

I'll do what I have to do
Take one step at a time, for you

Cause I'm systematic
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic
I'm systematically working on you
Hey!

Step by step I'm gonna wear your resistance down
I've got my mind made up and now my wheels are spinning around and around and around and around
