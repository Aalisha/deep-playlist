I got something to say to you....I'm gonna bring it down front
I'm not gonna pull any punches, baby....I'm gonna be blunt
I want you so bad....I wanna make love to you
I decided....I'm not gonna hide it

All my life I've been searching for (one like you)
Somebody I could give (myself to)
Who'll make me feel good (through and through)
So why wouldn't I be putting my focus on you

You've excited a part of me.....way down deep
And this feeling I get from you....I wanna keep
I hope you see fit...to come on and be with me
If you let me....I promise you won't regret me

All my life I've been searching for (one like you)
Somebody I could give (myself to)
...
