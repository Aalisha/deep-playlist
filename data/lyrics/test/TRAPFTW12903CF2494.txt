Perished are all doubts. Perished are all fears.
Perished into nothingness. I found that nothing dies.
Stop to reflect. Stop to resist. Might as well stop breathing.
And cease to exist.

(Chorus:)
You will never get to me. I see things you cannot see.
And i will never be, part of your righteous dream.
