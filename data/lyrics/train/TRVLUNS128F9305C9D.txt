"I got pictures of you
In funny poses
letter's from you with
fresh yellow roses
i've got souvenirs of
fun times together
and i'll shares thoses years
and you can bury it forever

chorus
I know we'll be lovers again
Darling
I know we'll be lovers again
It's a matter of time
Till you see that i'm
The one in the end
I was your friend
