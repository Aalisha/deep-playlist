Are you gonna lie to me
Are you gonna just keep talking
Are you gonna fly to me
Are you gonna keep on walking

Is it just the way you feel
you can never seem to notice
When it's somebody else's spiel
They'll be the one to be so hopeless

gonna be so sweet
gonna give me power
gonna become just like wildflower

Are you gonna hold my hand
Are you gonna hold it back now
Are you gonna take a stand
Are you gonna re-attack now
