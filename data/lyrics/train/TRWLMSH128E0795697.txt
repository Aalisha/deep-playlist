Hopped in my car
Went down to Birmingham, Alabama
There I went to the Museum Of Civil Rights
And got a lesson in suffering

There I saw the likes of Rosa Parks
Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King
And I got all emotional singin'
"We shall overcome, let freedom ring"

So now, I'm looking for a boy, looking for a girl
Who's got a dream inside to change the world
Give me a lady, come on give me a man
Who's strong enough to take a stand

And be a black light, a candle in the darkness
