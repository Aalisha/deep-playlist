Crazy man crazy
Crazy man crazy
Crazy man crazy
Man that music's gone, gone
Crazy man crazy
Crazy man crazy
Crazy man crazy
Oh man that music's gone, gone
When I go out and I want a treat
I find me a band with a solid beat
Take my chick and we dance about
When they start rockin boy we start to shout (we shout)
Crazy man crazy
