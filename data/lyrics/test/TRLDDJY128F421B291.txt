I hope this song brings back memories
I get this feeling the songs today ain't like they use to be
With a meaning, with a meaning, of love

When I think about, all these unhappy lives
Unhappy people, they must live unhappy lives
They forgot about, love for each other
Just hate, just hate on their mind
