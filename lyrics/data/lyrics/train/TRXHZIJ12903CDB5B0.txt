When there's no love nor hate in this world
When we reach out our hand to someone
but that someone is not there
I'm all alone in this forsaken world where time stands
ooh so still
I remember but now it's time for peace

The world ain't no longer
?! nhihehnmjcnnsj
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
It's in the hands of faith
