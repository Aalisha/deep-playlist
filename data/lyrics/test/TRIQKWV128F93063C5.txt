Catherine had a domain
Treasuries and fame
She had the of angel
At same

Amidst my maids
Of honour i pray
In the warrens of corridors
I restlessly stray

One night she woke up
From a spleep unquiet
Dressed herself and
Wended to windows

Who brought me this
Uneasiness and bliss
To mind and to heart
Of a loner in darkÂ ?

Quietly down
The stairs she floated
In her dark guise
To a garden of night

Someone is her
Still i feel no fear
Something unknown
