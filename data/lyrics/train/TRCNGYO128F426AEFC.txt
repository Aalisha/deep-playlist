What is left to forget here that doesn't exceed repression?
What's the use of acquiring things when they only give birth to obsession?

This is the plan after last plan after last plan
Heavy losses of the Fall of Man
I'm the self-effacing cannibal run out of bread
My stomach's upset and my sleep is dead

I can't shut myself up anymore
