Such a beautiful lady
The kind you find in a dream
And dreams are so real for me

With eyes so warm and soothing
They put me in a trance
And I imagine us by the warm cozy fireplace

The light shines on your face
Your smile gets me higher and higher
My heart starts to race

I gotta say what I feel
Cause girl you look so good to me
