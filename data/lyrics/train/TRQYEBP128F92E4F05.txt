This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
...

"God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy"
...
He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
...
