to believe is to deceive
down on knees you're choked on memories
turned into lies of pure demise
below to lay far beyond the day

a wretched fate
at the point of no return
doomed to crawl
into the darkes of deaths

forever ceased to be
(on the) ways to the grave

a flickering mind in the life rewind
...
