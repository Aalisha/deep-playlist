The time has come now for me to leave you
To stop my foolish hanging on
To yesterday's dream of tomorrow's true love
The shadow cast by children's new love
There is no time for tears or talking
There is no time for you
No time for you
Time has painted all my dreams blue
Pieces falling all around you
Around you around you around you
