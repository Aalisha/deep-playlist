Scraping skies with shirts and ties
And I can feel you waste away
The bets are long, I want to get it wrong with you
It's such a goddamn beautiful day

To hell with red lights, driving on
An open cage, this bird has gone
But I can't leave this town if you're not with me
If you're not with me

I've been fighting boredom and routine
I'll trade the white for forest green
But I can't leave this town if you're not with me
If you're not with me, we'll see
