Oh, seems like a day ago
Not quite like the last
And now I see him walking far away
Blasting down the street tonight
One more reason
It's a cold from the season
And I know
That she'll be pleasing me all night
She takes all my pains away
(She takes all my pains away)
Relieves all my cravings I'm craving at night
She loves when I feel awake
(She loves when I feel awake)
She loves when I peel off her clothing at night
Now, it's seeming like a ways away
Right around the street
And all a sudden, I was seein' her face
She offers me a ride around
