Dear family and friends,
I need to thank you
In this note that I'm sending you
I need to show my gratitude
I'm truly indebted to you
Thank you for pulling me through
Dear family and friends,
I really need to thank you
You were there for me,
so I will always be - there for you
And this is how I show my gratitude
Dear momma let me start of with you
I know there ain`t a thing you wouldn`t do,
to try and pull me through.
And if there`s anything good to be said about me,
Than it`s true that I owe it all to you.
Remember back when we're in our old apartement,
Where every minute that was spent was truly heartfelt
Even though pops was gone, I know you stould strong
And equipped me to convert thought to song
And in the end taught me right from wrong shit
Even though I ended up doing some wrong shit,
...
