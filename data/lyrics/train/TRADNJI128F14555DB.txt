Took a left turn at Albuquerque
You went north and I went south
It's just time so don't you worry
Hard to wait but patience pays

Open my door the cupboard's bare
It's hard to give when nothing's there
All this shit and such confusion
Tell myself it's not an illusion

We need some space between us
Take a deep breath and clear my head
We need some space between us
Fall the wall, and build a bridge
We need some space between us
Don't go out and get a new thing
Hey hey hey
