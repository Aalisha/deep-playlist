I spent my life thinking bout myself, 
I wouldn't change it for no one else.
I don't like talking when I watch T.V., 
I like to drink as much as I want,.
There must be something in the free champagne, 
It's not my party but I'm glad I came.
I saw you looking, I was looking back, 
Something happened to me.

I want you right now, 
I want you right now, 
Gotta be right now, 
I want you right now, 
Give me a chance! 

I could be fearless, 
I could be strong, 
I could be wiser, braver, 
I could be mean if that's what you want.
I'll be a fighter, 
Taking the crown, 
Gonna be louder, shameless, reckless, 
If that's what you want.
