Well here we are, we're back again safe upon the shore. 
In Belfast town we'd like to stay and go to sea no more. 

We'll go into a public house and drink till were content. 
For the lassies they will love us till our money is all spent.

So pass the flowing bowl while there's whisky in the jar 
and we'll drink to all the lassies at the Jolly Roving Tar.

Oh Johnny did ya miss me when the nights were long and cold, 
or did you find another love in your arms to hold.
