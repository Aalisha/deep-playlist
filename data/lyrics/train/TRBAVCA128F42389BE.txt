Aaaaaahhh'
I want you to know that, I am the man who
Fight for the right, not the wrong
Singin' this and singin' that
Going there, I'm growing there
Soon you will find out the man I'm supposed to be

Aaaaaahhh...
This man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble this man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam
What a bam bam, bam bam
It'll bring a bam bam
Bam Bam, what a bam bam
