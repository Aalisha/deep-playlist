All I ever wanted was to get away
And spend some time alone
To a big house in the country
To a private yacht with Wall St. on the phone
And in a million dollar paradise
Maybe I could sing a better song

But I've found something different now
And I finally understand
That money gets you everything
But it slips straight through your hands

And it's love that makes the world go round
