Cut it out, cut it out
I know it? s what you? re wanting to say
Burning up, burning up
I know why you? re feeling this way

There? s an ache you can? t erase
A yearning that you can? t replace

And you want Him, and you need Him
But you act like He? s not there
Yeah, you know that you? re hollow
And something? s missing here
So you push and you pull the hole in your soul
But you can? t make the hunger disappear
