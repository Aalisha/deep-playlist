Darling, darling, darling
Don't hesitate, let's go
Darling, darling, darling
I'll teach you all I know
I want to slap my titties
Across your face
We slam our bodies
In a famished pace
I want to treat you, baby
Like a horny dog
And ride your rapids, baby
On top of your big log

Darling, darling, darling
I blow on your mind
Darling, darling, darling
I think it started to grind
Oh, my dripping tongue
Across your skin
Fill my mouth with you
Until you start to grin
Come on, let's change positions
'cause I want more
Until your knee starts bleeding
On my marble floor
