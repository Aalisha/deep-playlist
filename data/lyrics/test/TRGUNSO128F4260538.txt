Well Lord I got to raise a fuss, Lord I got to raise a holler
Well I been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well Lord I tried to call my baby, I tried to get a date...
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do

Lord there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
You know my mom and papa told me, "Son you gotta make some money"

(Of course I do. I should, I work like a dog)
"Well if you wanna to use the car go riding next Sunday"
Well Lord I didn't go to work I told the boss I was sick
