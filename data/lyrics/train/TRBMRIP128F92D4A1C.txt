Making stars out of ordinary people
Doesn't make any sense
And if you're that fascinated with the boy next door
Then why don't you climb over the fence
Big Brother, X Factor
I used to be a celebrity
I am fully prepared to eat a spider
If you put me on the TV

We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only cos we watch this shit
That they keep on making more of it
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only cos we watch this shit
