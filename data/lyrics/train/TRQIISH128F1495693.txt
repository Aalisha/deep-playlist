Turn the lights down low baby please come closer I want some of your love tonight
Just a gentle touch baby of your hands on me
Is enough to set my heart so free oh baby

Baby tease me tonight
Girl you feel alright
I wanna love all over (over)

Baby tease me tonight
Make me feel alright
I wanna love you all over (oh girl)
