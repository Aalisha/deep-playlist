Violent breathing keeps the oxygen kissing
torn up lungs
my heart's beating
it wont keep me from saving everyone
(yet i still have)
messages to the ones i love
violent breathing
it wont keep me from saving everyone

so we sing into the night
and break all the silence
with one attempt to rise
the broken from the dead
avenge their souls
and mend their souls
we sing into the night
...
