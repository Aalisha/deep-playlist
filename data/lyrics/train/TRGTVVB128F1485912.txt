(Letter, we're going to write this letter)

Dear Mavis I'm compelled to write this letter
In the hope that you may soon be getting better
I've a feeling you should go and see a doctor
If you haven't then you know you really oughta
I was worried so I went to see the vicar
But before I could confess he first confessed to be a stripper

Dear Mavis it was very strange to see him
So I thought I'd write and ask you your opinion
Should I grass on him, report him to the Cardinal?
Or whether I should egg him on to turn professional?
If I dob on him they'll call him plastic scouser
But the only thing the Stripper Vicar wears is plastic trousers
