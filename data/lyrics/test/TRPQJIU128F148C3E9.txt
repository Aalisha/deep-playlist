Strange ways coming today; I put a dollar in my pocket and I threw it away
Been a long time since a federal dime
Made a jukebox sound like a mirror in my mind
To comb my worries, fix my thoughts, throw my hopes like a juggernaut walks
Now let-down souls can't feel no rhythm
Sorry entertainers like aerobics victims
Hybrid people light a wooded matchstick
Toxic fumes from the burning plastic
Beats are broken, bones are spastic, Robots talkin' with a southern accent
Voodoo curses, Bible tongues, voices comin' from the mangled lungs
Give me some grit, some get-down shit
Don't need a good reason to let anything rip

Radio's cold, soul is infected
[One by one, I'll knock you out]
