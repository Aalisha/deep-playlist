This is not a test or an SOS
I'm no longer on a quest to get girls undressed
I search through their hearts and no treasure I've found
I'm so lucky this one lets dogs hang around.

It's good having somebody good for a change
I thought that no good, dirty cheats had drove me insane
I've finally given up on love and romance
If I lay down the sword I'm givin my innocence.

(Coming for your heart like a cannibal)
