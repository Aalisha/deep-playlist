Gone tomorrow one day closer to your heart
Lost around me is time in itself when you’re near
Take the time I’ll show you the lover for you
You’re too young to know what it is that I feel

All that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you... Just wait for you
...
