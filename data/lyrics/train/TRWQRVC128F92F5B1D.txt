Lord, here's my offering
You are the One that takes what I bring
And somehow uses it
For Your glory, for Your glory

It don't add up but somehow it? s enough
To lift You up and let the world see
That it? s You, it? s You
The Maker of all, Lord I believe that

It? s You that lives in me
Faithful I will be
And I do everything
For Your glory, for Your glory

Your love is a message that can't be erased
...
