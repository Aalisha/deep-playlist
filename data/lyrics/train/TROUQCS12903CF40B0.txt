Stomach slashed open, he wields his blade
Obsessed with flesh from evil he was made
In my own blood soon my killer will wade
Puts glass into my mouth, a diet grim
Fills me up with pain above the brim

Vomit of blood ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Flowing blood from every hole
Carving out the remains of my soul
