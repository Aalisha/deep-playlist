Baby, holler if you want me
Baby, holler if you want me
Baby, holler if you want me
Baby, holler if you want me

It ain't nothing just call my name
I'll be right there 'coz nuthin's changed
I'm still in love with you, I'm sprung
You're my baby-boo, girl I'm tellin' you

Girl, you drive my train, you rule
I'm your pet, tell me what to do
Girl, I'm good in my heart, I'm real
