Milk thistle, milk thistle
Let me down slow
Help me go slow
I've been carryin' on

I'm not scared of nothin'
I'll go pound for pound
I keep death on my mind
Like a heavy crown

If I go to heaven
I'll be bored as hell
Like a little baby
At the bottom of a well

Fair child, fair child
How are you man?
Did you fix that storefront?
Did you start that band?

Don't be scared of nothin'
You go pound for pound
You bring peace to midnight
Like a spotted owl

I'll be rootin' for you
Like my favorite team
If somebody sweats you
You just point 'em out to me

All the sights and sounds
...
