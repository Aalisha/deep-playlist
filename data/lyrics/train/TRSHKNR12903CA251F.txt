yurayura yurameku nami no ma ni
kirakira kagayaku koe wa tada yure kanata e to

Sway, sway, swaying between the waves
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkling, their voices drift into the distance

yume miru KURAGE wa uta utau yo
yasashii umibe de nemuru

The dreaming jellyfish sing their song
and sleep on the gentle shore
...
