Petey here
I wanna tell im dead broke and im bout to go crazy
half a tank of gas, two ciggaretts
scrapping up change in the ashtray
then the voices its only a test of my faith
it was only

Damn theres a song for that nigga down south
That i was tellin y'all about yo check this nigga shit out
Memba that song i told you came on sounding like
He was talking about everything in my life
How he was at a point in his own
and the problem seemed to be taking a toll
He been fightin so long
seemed like everything he did went wrong
But he found the strenghth to keep on going
and wrote songs about it later on
I know this shit hit me home
especially when he was talikin about the money he owed
how he took the bills and paid a little somethin on each one
like he'd put somethin on his light bill, somethin on his phone
he'd get lil money in here he paid a lil more
