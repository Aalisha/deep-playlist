I've heard the story, I'm sure he held you down
Forced you to do things while I'm not around
But you lied, yeah you lied
But I've got cigarette eyes

Feel uneasy, I think of you less
My mind is so restless and I'm feeling depressed
Oh my, oh my, to see you with that spy
You lie, but I know cause I've got cigarette eyes

Out in the country I'm sure no one could tell
...
