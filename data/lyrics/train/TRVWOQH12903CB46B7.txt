You could spend your whole life
Wanting what you don't have
Tangled in the pain and strife
Dragging up the ghost of your past

You can curse the rain
But the river remains
Even as it all goes by

Baby, it's a long road
To the promised land
And there are dreams we hold
In the palm of our hand

We can never know
How the story will end
...
