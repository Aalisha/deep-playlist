You've got them all, by the balls
causin' waterfalls
Stone walls
Bar brawls
Common stalls that cause 'em all (?)

To you they crawl, body sprawl
Smokin' Pall Malls
Close call, stand tall

Doll, you make them feel so small
AND THEY LOVE IT!

The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)

I wanna be her

Yes I do

The way you rock, don't stop (or lone star)
Girl, you got the chops
Flip flop
She bop
Self-taught
You lick so hot
Are you conceived (?)
Kids receive
Crawling up the sleeve
Parents bleed
Can't conceive
That indeed we'll never leave

AND WE LOVE IT!

The boys wanna be her (The boys)
