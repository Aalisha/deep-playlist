Don't ever say you think of me
I don't want to be in your memory
A part of you, apart from me
There's nothing left of this to speak
Don't ever speak my name again
I don't want to be some fucking sordid tale
That is all just lies and fallacy
I don't want to be your history

I know you heard I'm doing well
And as far as I can tell
Another day has passed since I've fled
And you haven't said a word
...
