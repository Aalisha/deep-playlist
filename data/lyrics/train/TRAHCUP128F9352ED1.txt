You judge me
you hate me
can´t stand the shade
of my darker skin
Don´t know me
but show me
your ignorance
like my skin´s a sin

Don´t hate you
but you hate me
but one thing
you must understand
If you stress me
or test me
you´ll feel the wrath
of a crazy man

See your face of disgust
you like your faith
you like your trust
you judge my race quick to rush
but you don´t know me
what the fuck

Your race is used full of lies
we bring about your demise
my righteousness is on the rise
You wanna see the truth
open your eyes
...
