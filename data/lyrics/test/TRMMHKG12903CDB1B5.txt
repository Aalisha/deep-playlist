Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They built you up and broke you down again
So now you hope to beat the surf in

'Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all

The future is not what it used to be
Used to be
The future is not what it used to be
Used to be

Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They lit you up and found the ground again
So now you know to beat the surf in

'Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
