All I can see is black and white
And white and pink and blades of blue
That lay between the words I think
On a page I was meaning to send her
With you I couldn't tell if it bring my heart
The way I wanted when I started
Writing this letter to you

And if I could you know I would
Just hold your hand and you'd understand
I'm the man who loves you

All I can be is a busy sea of spinning wheels
