Feel my pain, live my sorrow
Do you know me, I am destruction
Conflicts brings, eternal devastation
Kill the war pigs, who deceive the nations
Here this message across the sea of the dead
Will we ever live this dream I have bled
And through politics and crime
Forgotten future dies, the seasons has begun
To rise again
And in the dark we weep
We cry and we sing, don't let it all begin
...
