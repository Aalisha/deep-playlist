There’s a stain there’s a stain there’s a stain on the floor
I want to soak want to scrub want to clean it and more
But all the nurses are refusing to let me out of bed
And my eyes are pouring nightly
There’s a crowd there’s a crowd there’s a crowd on my ward
I’m full of joy full of glee jubilation and more
These crazy stupid mother fuckers never leave me alone
And my lungs are wheezing slightly
There’s a buzz there’s a buzz there’s a buzzing of bugs
From flower beetles yellow jackets silverfishes to slugs
It’s always raining caterpillars from the circular fan
And my heart is pounding brightly

I swim in pharmaceuticals I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates the things I take the things that take me
