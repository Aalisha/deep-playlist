Hello, open the door
Guess who's gonna ring the chimes
That's right, lend me a paper
You know I've change you right

Oh, girl, make it a quick one
I'm only here tonight
I know, sadder but wiser
I'm still the same old guy

Take a look at me
See, I couldn't look no better
Girl, I'm at my peak
And that's a fact, that's a fact

Take a part of me
You know it couldn't feel no better
Take it all with ease
Before you break your back
Or get a heart attack

Such a, such a
(Wonderful)
Such a, such a

Goodbye, sorry I can't stay
But I don't have my style
I've got a dozen or more babes
...
