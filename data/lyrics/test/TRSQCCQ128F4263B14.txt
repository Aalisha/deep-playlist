(Poole/Martin/Poole)

Girlfriend
You ain't ever gonna be the right vibe
You ain't ever gonna kick the right drum
Better call it a day with this one
You ain't ever gonna be what he's looking for
Coz he ain't ever satisfied

So lay low
Simply lay low
Yeah, you can survive
Without another hero
Yeah, you can survive
Without another hero

If it's an honest kiss he's giving you
Fine
But you're screaming to yourself every night
