I want to fly a little to the right
I'll never get to crows dell
And I want to stay awake all night to realize
 (I'm not Ben Hoy)

What should I take with me to the north?
It's the good north
The promised success, the appropriate north
It's the good north

Apparently, you're happy, you've realized
I'm meant to be, unhappy, I've realized
 (I'm not Ben Hoy)

What should I take with me to the north?
It's the good north
The promised success, the appropriate north
It's the good north

'Cause I want to reunite, I'll never save
...
