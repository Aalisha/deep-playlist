We were only eighteen years old
Didn't know much about anything
The only thing we knew was this love
That we have for each other
You were the millionaire's daughter
I was the grave digger's son
They told me to keep away from you
They told you to stay away from me
Look at us now, we are living our dreams
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood.
Love is thicker than blood.
Love is thicker than blood.
Take your time, take your time
Take your time don't hurry
We have all aternity ahead of us.
