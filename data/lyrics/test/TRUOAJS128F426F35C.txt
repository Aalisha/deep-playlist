(crowd)
It's... all an illusion...
There's... too much confusion... fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion, fusion.

Down, down, down in your heart,
Find, find, find the secret.
Turn, turn, turn your head around,
Baby, we can do it,
We can do it all right.

Do you believe in love at first sight?
It's an illusion,
I don't care.
Do you believe I can make you feel better?
Too much confusion,
Come on over here.

Can we get together?
I really, I really wanna be with you.
Come on, check it out with me,
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too.
