sometimes i need some love from you
sometimes i dont like what you do
can you feel it?
Sometimes I need some love from you
Sometimes you don't like what I do
Can you feel it?
Feel it?
Who we are tonight might not be tomorrow
So so so so
What you gonna talk what you gonna talk
What you gonna talk about when you're all alone?
It's a whole different world when you're out there
And nobody's at home
I live between the lines of what is true and what is not
This is the price you pay when you don't believe there's a god
Very little, yeah, it's usually hot hot hot hot
Now go up the stairs and find yourself on the rooftop
As long as you don't mind what we're doin' fine,
what we're doin' fine fine fine fine...
Sometimes I need some love from you
