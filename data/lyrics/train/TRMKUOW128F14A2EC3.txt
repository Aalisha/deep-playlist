I never dream that I could fall
But something's come Over me
Now I'm sittin' starin' at the wall

Afraid for my sanity
The sound of your voice
The touch of your skin
it's hauntin' me

I'm still tryin' to come to my senses
But I can't look back So I'm takin' my chances
I wanna give you my heart give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms Never let go

Don't wanna live my life without you
