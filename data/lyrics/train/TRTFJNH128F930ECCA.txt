(Steve Perry, Clif Magness)

In the friendship of lovers
Lives the joy of the heart
And when trust is forsaken
Our whole world falls apart

And when the wind cries you're with me
And tears say enough
And when the song prays for love

Young hearts forever
Don't wait one moment this time
Love is forever
(with somebody like you, yeah)
The young hearts survive

On the wings of an angel
