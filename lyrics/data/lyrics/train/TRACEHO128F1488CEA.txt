If I had to
I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask
Would you like that? Would you like that?

And I don't mind
If you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be
