Yesterday I woke up in a Queens county jail
I remember throwing punches, smashing bottles, breaking chairs
Post bond today, on my way home, hell there's gotta be a better way
Stitches on my knuckles, blood on my face

To tell the truth I don't give a damn
It's just me and the boys, a shot of Jager for my friends!
