We were lovers for some time
We went separate ways that's fine
But I can't sit idly by

I've seen you hand in hand with him
Derrick is a man of whim
He will surely see you cry

I don't want to come between
I don't want to ruin your love
But Derrick is a strange machine

I don't want to be obscene
I don't want to tell what he's done
But Derrick is a loaded gun
