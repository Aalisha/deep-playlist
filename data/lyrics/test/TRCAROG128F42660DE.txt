The woman that I love is forty feet tall
She's a movie star, she's all in the papers
And everywhere I go, people hand me quarters
And they pat me on the back, they treat me like I'm famous

I'll never leave her side, 'cause today can be dangerous
And when the night arrives the light hit her features
And the cars drive by just so they could see her
And she never bats an eye, when someone takes her picture

Mr.Officer, if you come to take her
Then that means one of us
Gonna end up in a stretcher
Say Mr.Officer, if you come to take her
Then that means one of us
Gonna end up in a stretcher say
(Gonna end up in the papers)
(Gonna end up in the papers, yeah)
