Over The Eggshells
From the album Pay Attention

I'm over the eggshells I've been walking on
My eggshell walking days are done
I don't give a fuck about the apple cart
I'll upset everyone
Don't tell me on what or where to walk my friend
You once did, but those days are gone
I'm so over the eggshells
The ones that I've been walking on
Walking on, I'm waking up
Waking up, I'm walking out
Waking up and walking out on you!
