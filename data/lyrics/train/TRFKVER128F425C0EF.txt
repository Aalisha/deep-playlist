Hold It, Don't Drop It (Hold It, Push It)

Know what you're doin'
What you doin' to me
Try to stop me, can't stop me
Cos you know what I need
You got me all open and now you tryin to leave
Hold It, Don't Drop It (Don't Drop It)
Stop it, (cant stop it, wont stop it)

Every time I try to run, something keeps stopping me (stopping me)
I try my best to turn around, but your touch wont let me leave
