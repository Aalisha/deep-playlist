Just relax & stay a while
I feel the need 2 show u my design (my design 4 u)
Ease concern, my curious child
I plan 2 take u 2 a whole new world (new world just 4 2)

If u believe in me 2night
U're not the vow that I will fight
2 do everything I need 2 make u understand (this I swear 2 u)
Sacred as everything I feel
I am the love that u must steal
& 2gether we can seek the promised land

Nothing I won't do (oh no, my love)
My love belongs 2 u
Say u wanna come along with me 4 a ride
Tell me that u wanna know the meaning inside
U'll never really know
I'll never let u go
All the signs r there 2 let me in
I feel the time is right, now let begin
