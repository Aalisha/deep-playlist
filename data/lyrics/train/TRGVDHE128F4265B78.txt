(Lewis Anderson/Jason Sellers)

I know how much I've hurt you
Trying to stand my ground
Raising my voice building defenses
While trying to tear yours down

I want you so much, I need you so near
Please don't give up til I make that clear
Cause

This is my heart talking now
No anger, no ego, no pride
This is my soul reaching out
