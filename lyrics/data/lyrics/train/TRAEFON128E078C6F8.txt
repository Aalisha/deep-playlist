Oh now Yeah Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah I, I, I, I, I See you lyin' here You're so close You're so near

Causing sensations rollin' through me Comes on strong, feels just like a spell Sensations rollin', turnin' from me to you Causing this aura of heat to swirl

Your lips Your undulating hips Squeeze me oh so tight Fulfill me through the night
