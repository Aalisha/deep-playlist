sometimes a ring don't mean a thing
diamond rings will come and go
but this is what u ladies need to know

Yo i know us brothers do a whole lot of things
that make you sisters think we ain't worth a thing
but let me tell you bout this one special thing
when a mans ready to be faithful
its a feeling no man can deny and its a moment no money can buy
Cuz when it comes it comes thats when the playing is done
a womans victory is won

This is what it means when man says he needs you
This is what it means when he says he cant breathe without you
This is what it means he says he cant live a minute without you
This is what it means when the playing is done and your victory is won

Thats when he's ready to be faithful
when we feel no shame crying in pain
when he's ready to be faithful
when we realize that games don't bring gain
when he's ready to be faithful
...
