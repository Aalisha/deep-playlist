Every time I hold you close to me
I don't mind tellin' everyone it's plain to see
That I love you, yes I love you

Gonna tell the whole wild world
Baby you're so good to me, you're good to me

If you're feelin' lonely any night
Just keep thinking of our love
And you will be alright
Cause I love you, yes I love you

Gonna tell the whole wild world
...
