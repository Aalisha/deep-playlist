I want to climb the highest peaks of the Universe
To reach the tallest mountains of the moon
I set my soul on fire, transcend this world of nothing
Imagination running mad to the extreme

I want to fly on the wings of the Firebird

I need to burn the distance, leave this old world below
My flesh is soon consumed in a crazy smoke
And endless source of power, eternal fire I'm breathing
My voice as a burning tongue the sun is licking
