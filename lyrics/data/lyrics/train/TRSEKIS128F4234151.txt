Had my share of trouble
I've had my share of pain
I've picked myself up so many times
And been knocked down again
But one thing I know, one thing I found
Well you can't, you can't, you can't
Can't keep a good man down

Once I had allot of money baby
Right now I couldn't raise a dime
I had myself a real good job
But now all I have is time
And I don't worry, I don't worry
'Cause you can't, you can't you can't
Can't keep a good man down

So many time I been a fool, hey hey
