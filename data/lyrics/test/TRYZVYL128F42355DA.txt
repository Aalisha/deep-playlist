[Chorus (Richter)]

I dont know why 
do u wanna hurt me 
When i was only flirting 
So why you trying to ruin my life 
It's alright 
And I don't think that im deserving 
Im going through this hurting 
just wanna hear you say its alright 
Its alright 

[Johnny Richter]

We used to be smooth as silk so how it go wrong? 
How we let are love go and loose are tight close bond? 
Why we gotta end it on a very sour sour note? 
Well i ant ready to give in and just let you go 
You always think im out cheating when im on the road 
Even though i always call you after every show 
Going way outta my way to let everybody know 
That i got a girl at home and that this girl she got my soul 
Taking total control over my heart since the start 
And now you wanna take my heart and rip it all apart 
All because of silly ass rumors and stupid friends 
You couldnt have let other people bring you and me to an end 
Nah no way that shit just cant happen 
I couldnt belive when i came home you was packin 
I cant begin to fathem having to go at it alone 
I just wanna here your voice even if its on the phone 

[Chorus (Richter)]

I dont know why 
do u wanna hurt me
