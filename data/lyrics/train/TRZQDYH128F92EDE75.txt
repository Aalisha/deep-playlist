Upside down to Italy
and then again England
London you're not my friend
but you can be
Springtime but no trace of it
here in London
I wear my cloak like Sherlock Holmes
if you remember him?

"Don't you worry, love"
"Let me help you, love"
"There you go, love!"
All this "Brilliant, love!"
"Will you excuse me, love?"
There you go again...

London!
The way you hate me is better than love
and I'm head over heels
London!
The way you wanna get rid of me
makes me weak in the knees

Do you think you don't care about me?
