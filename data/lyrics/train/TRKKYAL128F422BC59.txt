A beautiful night's a beautiful night

its colourful soul's embracing my song
and a cello's playing in my head
just for me
and a new desire is blowing sounds
in my ear

shall I go for a smile? Shall I or
shall I keep it to myself?
but I would share it with you
if you could understand...
a beautiful night's a beautiful night
