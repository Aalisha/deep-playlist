Oh, darling
I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night
Always thinking about you

But if I had the
Chance to start all over
I would be wishing today
On a four leaf clover

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Oh, darling
I can't hold out much longer
For the pain is getting deep
Oh, the hurt keeps getting stronger
