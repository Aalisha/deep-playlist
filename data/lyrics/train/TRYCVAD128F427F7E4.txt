You've got the soul of the sun in your eyes
I have been trapped by the shine and the light
You got the heart of a queen and your mind
Gives me the kicks that I need to survive

As I've been trying to say it to you
You have seen me right through
You've got the heat
You're surreal
I can feel
You're a goddess
You're taking me down

Give it to me Ellie, Ellie it's a saturday night
You are turnin' into mine I know
Now I know
Sing it to me Ellie, Ellie see the satuday lights
You know that you're mine tonight I know
Now 'cause you got the soul of the sun
