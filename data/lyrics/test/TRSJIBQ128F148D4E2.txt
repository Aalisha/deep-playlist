There was a time I was happy in my life
There was time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother it was nice
Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand I was just a kid

Oh mother why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father you know I'm not so free

I got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

There was a time I was happy in my life
There was time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother it was nice

Oh mother why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father you know I'm not so free
