Awaken to a world devoid of hope and faith
I don't want to look anymore
I turn it off but it won't go away
The pain of a high school end

The rest in a young suicide
The media drawing in
An escape from a young girl's life
From a young girl's life

We're falling further every day
Now our tallest towers sway
I'm holding on in this world of decay
And I've realized

This is anything but beautiful
Anything but beautiful
This is anything but beautiful
Anything but beautiful

Awaken to a day
The fear in the eyes of a boy
...
