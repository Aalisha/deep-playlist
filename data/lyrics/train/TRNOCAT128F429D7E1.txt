Your Word Oh Lord is eternal
It stands firm
Your faithfulness continues through all the earth
All creation hangs on your every word

{CHORUS}
With the sound of your voice
Water still, you are Lord over all
With the touch of your robe, the sick are healed
And for you Jesus we all fall down

My soul finds rest and comfort
