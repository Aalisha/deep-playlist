Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice, yeah

Listen to the sound of my voice
You can check it on out, it's the weapon of choice, yeah
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
It's the new weapon, the weapon of choice

You can blow with this or you can blow with that
