When you're away
I'm feeling empty, I lose my mind
But when you're around
I take for granted most of our time

Honey, you say that I'm cold
And sometimes I'm out of control
Baby, you know how I am
At the end, you're always mine

I don't mean to when I hurt you
But I need you, I assure you
Just let me be when I'm crazy
At the end, you're still my only

At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
