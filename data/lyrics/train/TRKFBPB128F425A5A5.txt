[INTRO]

[VERSE I]
There's no sign on the gate
And there's mud on your face
Don't ya think it's time we reinvestigate the situation
Put some fruit on you plate
 
[PRE CHORUS]
You've forgotten how it started
Close you eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made
 
[CHORUS]
And you're down on your knees
It's too late, oh don't come crawlin'
And you lay by my feed
What a big mistake, I see you fallin

[VERSE II]
Got a buzz in my head
And my flowers are dead
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
Don't believe what you said

[PRE CHORUS]
[CHORUS]

[VERSE III]
I could sting like a bee
Careful how you treat me
Baby I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation
Close the door as you leave

[PRECHORUS]

[ALT. CHORUS]
And you cry over me
I can't wait, I feel you stalling
And you try to reach me
What a big mistake, I hear you calling

[CHORUS]

END...
