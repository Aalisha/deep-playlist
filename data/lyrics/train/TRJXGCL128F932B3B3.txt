Verse 1:

Oh Elizi,
When I have you my life shines up.

Elizabeth you buy me meals cos I can’t cook.

Elizi name one thing
You won’t buy me, constant frowns
Like boy, oh don’t try me

Elizabeth you let me have the latest fabrics
And that’s the main reason I love your tactics

Elizabeth you’re my sunshine,
And that’s why you’re always up on my mind.

Chorus:

Oh elizi
I can’t live without ya

Everyday
My life I’m talking bout ya

All
Of my friends they go on about ya

Elizi oh oh, elizi oh.

Verse 2:

Oh Elizabeth you know it’s
All about you

When you took me to
Paris you turned kinda
Blue

There’s no way I can do this
Without you

Because everywhere
You go you’re willing to change

At
The end of the month you always
Disappear
...
