See through me, I'll die in you
Drive through my hell, these hours are wasted
Won't you dive in me, you breathe me in
I am but air, polluted but still
Dive in me, let me in
I am just water, I am nothing less
Cold like stone
And nothing feels the same anymore
Tried so goddamn hard to please
This was enough for you
