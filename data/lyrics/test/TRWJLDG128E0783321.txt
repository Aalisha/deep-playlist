Girls, when you've got a good love
Who's gonna treat you right
But another guy offers you a better life
Right away you start to swoon
Because he offers you the moon
Tell me, is riches
Worth more than love and affection?
Don't be steered in the wrong direction 'cause
(A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush)
Remember girls
(A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush)
So hold onto what you've got
You're just losin' a love that's true
For a love that might last a day or two
...
