Mmmmmm
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeaheyeah

Thinkin' back
To the feeling that I had when I first saw your face
I knew that it was you
Some time has passed and the feelings that I had before still are the same
'Cause you, never changed, nooo

Even though, I don't show it, girl
I just want you to know that
Even if we fight a million times over little things
We can still make it better
I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring
That I'ma love you forever
I fall for you deeper everyday
And I'm feeling it now, girl more than ever
But with our type of love, forever ain't enough

I've been searchin' my whole life
