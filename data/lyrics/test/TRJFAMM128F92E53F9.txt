HELLO
This is J
L.J. baby
No wait a minute please, don't hang up on me
You see I know you been going through some changes
But i've been going through some changes myself
Walking the floors can't sleep
Slamming doors darling to me it's just a drag
But it's all because
I Can't Get Over You
I tired and I tired
Oh I just can't get you off my mind
This feeling I have for you
Is strong indeed with a flame I can't put out
I tired to do without you and fine someone new, someone new
You found yourself a new love
