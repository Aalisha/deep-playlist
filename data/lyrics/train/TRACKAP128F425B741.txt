What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the vemon seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
...
