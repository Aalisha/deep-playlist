Through the looking glass, I watched in silence as we crumbled
Like ashes in a breeze, fall apart
Bone and flesh, reduced to dust and lies before me
Within this moment I knew, that I had changed forever
Unholy passion of man's great loss, was offered to us this day
As our anguish poured like rain, observant to my decay
May the torment I live through now, echo through eternity
Sing it's song inside my mind and descend into memory
I remember the sound that their bodies made, as these gods of war were
Split in two before my eyes and I, can't save them all or speak of peace
