Every day brings change,
And the world puts on a new face,
Certain things rearange,
And the world seems like a new place.

Secretly I've been trailing you,
Like a Fox that preys on a Rabbit,
I had to get you, and so I knew,
I had to learn all your ways and all your habbits.

You're the catch that I was after,
I looked up and I was in yout arms,
And I know I was captured.

What's this whole world coming to,
Things just ain't the same,
...
