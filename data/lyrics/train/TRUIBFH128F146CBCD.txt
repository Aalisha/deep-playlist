I'm a jealous man
Oooh, I can't relate
She's a doe-eyed girl
Oooh, with no complaints

But there's another side that I'm trying to crack
If you open your mind and let me take a stab
At the secrets that you know
Sweet troubled soul

She's a summer tramp
Oooh, all dressed in black
A fluorescent tan
Oooh, sweet heart attack
