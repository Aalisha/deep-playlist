[Intro:]

oh man i got a splittin' headache
and my heart is broken up into a thousand tiny little microscopic pieces

[Chorus:]

i got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes
i'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many people knows
that leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as i know it
and i guess i got no choice but to be a poet

[Verse One:]

now in my natural habitat i gravitate towards having that
and i elevate on having that
and i'll never get caught in your rabbit trap
from Yellowstone to Venezuela
Nigeria down through Australia
there's somethin i learned that i gotta tell ya
there's a whole lot of us ain't wrapped too tight

now i could been your doctor or your lawyer
or come to your house and clean up for ya
self destruction won't destroy ya
if you got somebody that's lookin out for ya
men are murdered women raped
people gettin beat on videotape
and people elsewhere tryin to escape
just to come to America to lick the plate
helicopters scope the land
hell is here so i hope you 'stand
hip-hop culture is African
and rappers like me gon' rule the earth

[Chorus]
