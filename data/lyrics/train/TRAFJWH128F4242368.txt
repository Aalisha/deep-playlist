Bound to this hallowed earth, where no life tastes the sun
Amongst the ruins of mankind, the dark and I are one
Flesh and blood just a memory, time's forgotten tome
Dismal like the world above, where life is tortured still

I lie here the condemned
In the darkness and the filth
Soon to be the graves
Of the lives we failed to save

The hand of God keeps striking down, his soldiers raging on
Doing all the Devil's work, in God's name they are absolved
...
