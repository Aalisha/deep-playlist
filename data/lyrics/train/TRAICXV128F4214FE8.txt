Chloe don't know better
Chloe is just like me, only beautiful
A couple of years' difference
But those lessons never learned
Did you know?

Chloe does the tables in the French Quarter
She's always been given
So I can't always make her laugh
But I'm proud to say
And I won't forget

The time spent layin' by her side
The time spent layin' by her side
Dreams like this must die
And a dream like this must die
Dream like this must

You ever heard the story of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall
Talkin' to my altar, say life is what you make it
And if you make it death well rest your soul away
Away, away, yeah, child

It's a broken kind of feelin', she'd have to tie me to the ceilin'
...
