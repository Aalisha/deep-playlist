That first little kiss from your school sweetheart
Parked in the dark in your parents car
Take her by the hand, gaze in her eyes
Feel the first flutter of them butterflies

That's what love'll get ya
Don't let anybody tell you different
I've been in and out enough to vouch
That's what love'll get ya

You're impressin' her Daddy, kissing up to her Mom
Saving up money for the Senior Prom
Runnin' wide open when she slams on the brakes
