When I saw you there

Just in the other day
You smiled at me
In a secret way

So I let you in

And you captured me

I'm a prisoner
Is what I wanna be

When you fell it's like is a love
All the stars lift you up
Where a place you hide above the top of the world
I'm just glad that I found you

Like a thief you came
...
