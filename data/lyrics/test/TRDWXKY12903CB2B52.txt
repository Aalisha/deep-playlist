(Smith/Willis/YahZarah)
We made a vow to write us out
So what is there to figure out
Baby, do we need to talk about it?
Don't let pride push us apart, mm
We didn't even come to this
Us not knowing how to talk
Baby, you should know you're the love of my life
Mm, and I want you to hold me
And tell me you'll be the last to leave and to stay with me
And we'll work it out, without a doubt
That's all I'm asking of you
Oh-oh-oh, show me
And tell me, baby, you'll never leave and to stay with me
Without a doubt, we'll work it out
That's all I want to hear from you, oooh, oooh, ooh
Oooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooooooh
Oooooooooohh, ooooh
