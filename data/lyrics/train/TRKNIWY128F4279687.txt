Someone taught me how to dance last night
What a mover he was!
And someone taught me how to do it right

What a groover he was!
He taught me all the steps to do the rock'n'roll
I found my sense of rhythm but I lost myself control
When he siad:

Dance little lady dance
Dance little lady dance
You know you've only got one chance 
Come on dance
dance 
dance 
oh...
