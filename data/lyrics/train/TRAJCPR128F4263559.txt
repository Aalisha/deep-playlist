In the twinklin' of an eye
Girl you had me hypnotized
And I didn't care a thing about love
But I quickly start believin'
'Cause I found myself a reason in you
Yeah I've got a thang for you

And when I think
Think of the way I used to be
I was always all alone
Always doin' somethin' wrong
And when I think
Think of the change you brought to me
Girl I wonder why it took you so long?

Well alright
Well okay baby
I finally done me somethin' right
I've got you in my life
Well alright
Well okay baby
I finally done me somethin' right
I've got you, got you, got you in my life
 (Got you, got you, got you in my life)
(Got you in my life)

Oh it was deep within my heart
