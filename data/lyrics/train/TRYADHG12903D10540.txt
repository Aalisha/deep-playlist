In the beginning of the chronology
There were centuries lasting persecutions
The reason of fear, was that Christians are
Messengers of Satan... 

In the middle ages the rescuers
Were burned at the stake
Putrid carcasses are only memories
That are left from their bravery

The auto-dafe death was their
Unwritten destiny
Cadaverous smell inside the coffin
...
