I don't want to introduce you to my friends, 'cause I think they'll get the wrong idea. 
You're so fetching in that dress - They'll think we have messed around 
And though I'll tell them otherwise, I was gone all night with you. 
What most people do will be running through their heads. 
They don't need to see that I met a pretty girl last night.
