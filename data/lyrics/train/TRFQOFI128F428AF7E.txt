You go out when you get ready
You come home when you please
You don't ever want to love me
Think it outta be all right with me

Listen, when I try to talk to you, baby
And let you know just how I feel
All you tell me if I don't like it
There's someone else out there will

Oh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or if you don't ask me no questions, darling
...
