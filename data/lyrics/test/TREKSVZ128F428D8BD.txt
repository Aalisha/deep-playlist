Skulls piled on concrete, executions made with ease
Tombs filled with sickness, an invader who won't take heed

Unleashing death on mankind, excluding not a soul free
He won't be satisfied
A gallery of death art, primitive actions to be seen
Ceiling dripping from their blood, loves to watch them creep
