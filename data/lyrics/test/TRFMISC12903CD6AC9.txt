I don't wanna be ignored, oh God
When I'm a gun in a fist fight
You're chewing with an open mouth, raw meat
Your blood drool attracts the flies

I give a little to you, I give a little to him
I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him
I give a little to her

I don't wanna be left out or get fucked
But there's a talent in your lies
If you're chewing with an open mouth, raw meat
Your blood drool attracts the flies
