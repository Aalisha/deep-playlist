He's back together again
Yeah, everyone is glad that he's together again
Just like the old days, old days, old days
Yeah, he could sing, he could sing, he could sing
He's back together again
You know he's still got the moves, you know the grooves still there
Just like the old days, old days, old days
Yeah, he could sing, he could sing
Oh, listen to him sing, yeah
Back together again, back together again
Singing the same old story
Back together again, back together again
The old songs never end
Gives you something to believe in
Remember sixty-five
