What's wrong with me, I hear her say 
Forget everything, and what it means to me 
I'm not alive, that's what she means 
I hate to disappoint her, I only need some room to breathe 

What's wrong with me, what's wrong with you 
Must we compete, who speaks the truth 
You can have it all, if it serves you well 
As long as I leave with myself 

Chorus: 
I'm wide awake, I was dead before today 
If you make it till tomorrow, see it works both ways 
I will not try to apologize, for what I know is right 

Another chance wrapped up again 
...
