When you were young
Did you ever love somebody?
Like I love
I love you now
'Cos now that your's older
I see you don't mind
Letting go of my hand in a crowd
You don't wanna hold tight

And when we kissed one night
There's a million hearts
Beating in a row
I wish they go away
I'll say it again
There's a million hearts
It's the break to see
Every time you go away

When you were young
Did you ever fall down
...
