- And do you know what the press and everybody is gonna be asking?
- What?
- Who IS Danger Woman?!

If you've seen it once, you'll see it again
I told everyone and all of my friends
Well there she is and she's at it again
And I think it's all over and now:
(You're gonna get it!)

She's hanging off the chopper
And no one's gonna stop her
Don't try and call the doctor
'Cause she's jumpin' around now
Handle bar standing
And flying over canyons
No hands on the landing
Now we're rollin' around on the ground
