I stood in the warmth of night
Chilled to the bone
Hundreds of faces in sight
Still I'm alone

Door after door
Room after empty room
I've stood here before
But under a different moon

In the longest days, in the darkest night
Down the longest road, there's a presence of light
But I hear a voice that calls me
It's love's name I'll call in the end, oh yeah
