Well we pounded the pavement between
dotted lines
But we always belonged to the
fugitive kind
We were never the best but we were
better than this
To be made to bow down among princes
I got thrown around hallways and
bedrooms and towns
And you run from that voice and
it drags you around
It don't matter the ruse or the
weapons we choose
There is only one thing that can free us


Oh so here I am
The lion and the lamb
I was born to be telling this story
I could only be telling this story
I will always be telling this story
