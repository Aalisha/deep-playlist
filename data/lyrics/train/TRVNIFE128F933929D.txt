In the center of a man theres a god with a plan
You can call me a fan in a _________
I can benefit with talking to a spirit on a plane
And a heart thats gold
Taught with ways of indigen and a fiction of the mind
You can picture me a tenant of streets no longer wanna be
Freedom of an invisible inhabitant
In my habitat fathom the pain killer
Killing me and taking me for everything that I own
Tell you man its all about the freedom that I gain
Recognizin all the evil spirits on the road of recovery
Found my home any zone that I want pick it up and ship it down
Im tryin to slang hope like a guy slang dope
