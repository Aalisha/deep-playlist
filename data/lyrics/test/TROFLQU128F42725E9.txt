I can only sing it loud
always try to sing it clear
what the hell are we all doing here
making too much of nothing
or creating one unholy mess
an unfair study in survival I guess

but it always comes down to
what to do when it's all around you
and this tightwire act
leaving us here for dead to news of the world
and liquor piles up ahead
...
