Isn't it nice, sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
I can make a film and make you my star
You'll be a natural the way you are

I would like you on a long black leash
I will parade you down the high streets
You've got the attraction
You've got the pulling power

Walk my doggie, walk my little Sex Dwarf
We can make a scene, we'll be a team
Making the headlines sounds like a dream
When we hit the floor you just watch them move aside

We will take them for a ride of rides
They all love your miniature ways
You know what they say about small boys

Sex Dwarf
Sex Dwarf
Sex Dwarf
Sex Dwarf
Sex Dwarf
Sex Dwarf

I'm a Rolls Royce, look it's so huge!
It's big and it's gold with my dumb chaufer
Looking to procure, run little doggie
Lure a disco dolly
