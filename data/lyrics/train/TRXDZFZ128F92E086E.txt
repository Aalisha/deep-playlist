(Keith, Skeoch)

Hey, what's the deal man, don't it feel like something's goin' on
What's goin' down what's goin' around, and I'm gonna get some
What's this I see, a familiar face, and it's coming my way
I said I don't know who it is, it might be you and this just might be my day

Action talks - now action talks and bullshit walks
Action talks - you got something to say
Action talks - start talking, or get your walking
Action talks - start making your move on me-yeah-yeah

Sure was not nice, but wasn't going right, forget the consequences
Let's work it out instead of workin' out
