It was you, it was me
It was love, it was real
We would touch, we would kiss
And we'd love the way it feel

It was time spent together
Leaving all the world behind

And you wonder why I'm trippin'
Shake my head and close my eyes
 (Close me eyes, baby)
How could you never listen
When I try to talk to you
 (Talk to you, talk to you)
And you knew something was missing
When I'm running from the truth

Oh baby you said
 (You would never leave me)
Said you
 (Always be there for me)
I can't
 (Understand the reason)
Why you?
 (Why you want to play me?)

 (Oh baby)
You said
 (You would never leave me)
Said you
 (Always be there for me)
I can't
 (Understand the reason)
Why you?
 (Why you want to play me?)

Remember when, we would chill
You would tell me how you feel
You wanted me, you needed me
The only one to ease your mind

I was caught by surprise
