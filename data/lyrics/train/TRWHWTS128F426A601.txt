Money
Money...

Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money

So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money

You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...

If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You do anything for money...

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
