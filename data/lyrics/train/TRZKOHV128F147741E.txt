Ahhhhh...
Ooooh-eee...

I feel it's time that we depart
For futures that means there's no start
All hopes and a sense that we may feel
'Cause peace has lost its mass appeal

Concern has fostered change of mind
Now all that's certain is a passing of time
With patience gone, now greed prevails
Oblivion time we set sail

But it's not as bad as it may seem
I know a place that's found in dreams
The visions in my mind let me see
That Heaven's gates may truly be
Where your inner soul is known to you
And spiritual ground is captured too
If you open your mind you'll be welcome to

Escape that (Going back, going back, back, back)
Escape that (Going back, going back, back, back)
Escape that (Going back)
Where's there's no wrong
When life was strong

Escape that (Going back, going back, back, back)
Escape that (Going back, going back, back, back)
Ooh Escape that (Going back)
Where's there's no wrong
...
