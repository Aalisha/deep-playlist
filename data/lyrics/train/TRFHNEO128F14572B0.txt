I can't believe I could have been so blind
but love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time
but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night
to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black & white
and I can see the picture very clear

I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why i gotta say goodbye

It isn't like you never had the chance
to change your tune
...
