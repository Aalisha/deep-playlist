[Prevail]

The induction of Paris green leaves
What you see with no seams or so it seems
And as it stands it seems that I never land
I sight by laser beam float inches above the sand
Birds prey exit larger than the point of entry
The son to father colossal no mathematical gentry
They sent me without weaponry forced to forge my own Infiltrate fortune five watch them clone their own
I've been blown out of proportion or so it's been discussed
I blow out physical portions and walk from settled dust
Bring fear to your factory watch your edge crush
Attendance to his session breaks parameters set
Until the audience agrees the medics should be sent

[Mad Child]

I'm a bad man
baseball battin' your brains like Bam-Bam
Ask me if I give a damn
Never that I'm putting mc's on front street
