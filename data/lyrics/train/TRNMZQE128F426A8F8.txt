Playing with fire gets you burned
I knew it, but still I didn't take heed
Two is company, three's a crowd
I knew that too, but still I couldn't let go
It's burning me, burning me
Like a beggar for money I'm drawn...
Between two fires I don't stand
Filled with a flame both bitter and sweet
It's burning me, burning me
Like a beggar for money I'm drawn...
To the flame
I am the one to blame
Flame
