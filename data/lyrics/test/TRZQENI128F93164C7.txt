Thinking back when we first met
I remember what you said
You said you'd never leave me
I let go of your hand
Built my castle in the sand
But now I'm reachin' out again
And I'm not letting go
Till you
Hold me
Mold me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
See I gotta find my way back home
So why don't you
Shape me
Make me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way
Back home
