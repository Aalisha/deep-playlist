Does she make you laugh?
Does she make you cry?
Does she call your name?
Let me tell you why.

Have you ever tried to look into her eyes?
Have you ever tried to look into her heart?

There is no-one home.
Time will heal you
Time heals everything
Just an empty room.
Time will help you
Time helps you forget
There's no tears for you.
Time will heal you
Time heals everyone
There's no heart at all.
