My sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely
He said that he and I were through
I started out drinkin' for pastime
Drivin' nails in my coffin over you

I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Drivin' those nails over you

Ever since the day that we parted
I've been so sad and so blue
...
