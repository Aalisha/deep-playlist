Roll that dice again, again
And once or twice you’ll reel me in
What I’ve got is not what I came for
But I’ll keep coming back for more

Come on, lay your head upon my chest
The odds are slim, but isn’t that the test?
In this game you either bend or break
And I don’t know what kind of mess we’ll make
...
