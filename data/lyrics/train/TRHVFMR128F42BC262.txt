Lay there, please don't move baby on me, don't you stop
Doggy, comin' through baby watch me hit the spot
You make me wanna speak Spanish, you make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot

Strawberries soakin' in Amaretto out in the limo
Be spitty, got the car lookin' pretty, in the window
Lets hit the indo, commit a sin in this crescendo
Smoky, foggy take off your coat, lets hit the doggy

Pull out your scrunchies, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin' my brain
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky
Without a clue, not even a hickey

Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than your man
I can even make you feel me when you're usin' your hand

I'm confident, like an MVP, got the key to the CPT
Lookin' for a G like me, she F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at? True love only can be that
I'm tellin' you that you the shit, call me when you get this hit

Do I love her, do I need her?
Uh huh
Do I take my money out and feed her?
No, no
And should I treat her
No
Unlike no other?
Nah
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

Do I love her?
Uh huh
Do I need her?
Oh, yeah
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her
Yeah you do
No I don't love her
And I don't need her
Yeah, yeah
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her

See baby, I got a spot to fill
And all that callin' me out my name gonna have you
