This twisted fate, I found my hate
Is this the deep revelation?
I was meant to set myself free
But my hate was cheating me

Fearless, low kind
Inverted, you and I
Desire, in sight
Wanting your life

Pain, thirst to satisfy
Feeding on the taste of life
Wanting you to embark
Welcoming you to the dark
