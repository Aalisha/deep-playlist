Zero... Where are you?...
Don't you remember why you came to Everywhere?...
The piece of mind that you came to find has disappeared ...
For all that you could take was piece of cake and wine ...
And now you'll have to wait another time ...

Maybe you're here for the giggle
Maybe you're into the puzzle
Maybe you're blowing the bubble
Maybe you're all in a muddle

The more you know
The more you know
You don't know what you know
Stone's throw left to go
Bad weather hell for leather
Now and zen you goof again
You Never Blow Your Trip Forever

Earth mother soul brother
Be high here now
Third eye open soon
Meanwhile new world group soul
Lost and found underground
Next time round

A real weird number
Is Zero the man
Because he a turnin on
Round & round again
They say he'll never make it
But I think he can
