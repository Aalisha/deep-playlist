I went out in the world I lived in London town
Though I knew that those streets weren't paved with gold
I looked up to a man and he never let me down
But he said if you want your music sold you should

Be smart or lucky
If you can't break the mould, break the rules
Make friends or money
But if you would be King be cruel

There is no clockwork in the stars
No-one cares how good you are
Look around the world is full
Of hungry souls who want it all
...
