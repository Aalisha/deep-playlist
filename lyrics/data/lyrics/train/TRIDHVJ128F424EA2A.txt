Boy you know you make me float
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I'm on dope
Cause you, you serve me on a regular
Boy we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
There now hold me close
Boy let's take this overboard now

I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle
