She wears those micromini dresses
Hhair hanging down her back
She wears those seethrough sweaters
She likes to wear her stockings black
And if I see her tonight
You can bet your life I'll attack

She got beautiful teeth
A toothpaste adman's dream
She got a beautiful form
The best I've ever seen
I'm gonna get her tonight
I don't care where she been

Well I said, "Baby, baby, baby what you doin' to me?"
