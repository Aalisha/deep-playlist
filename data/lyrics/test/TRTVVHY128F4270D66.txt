I traveled 40 miles of bad road
Runnin' from the county man
Just broke from the Stone County prison
And I'm never going back again

Gotta make my way from Stone County
Try to catch the Santa Fe
I can hear her whistle calling me
Just a half a mile away

I left my home down in Texas
Seven long years ago
I remember my mom on my daddy's farm
Sittin' in Tobacco Road

I'm gonna rock 'till I die in Stone County
...
