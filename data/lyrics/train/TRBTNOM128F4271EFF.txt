Hooh-hooh..., hooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hooh, hooh, hooh

Take good care of yourself
Take good care of yourself
I worry 'bout you, when you're go-one

When you leave my arms (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I feel so ba-ad
And I just think about the good times we ha-ad
When we kiss goodni-ight (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, I wanna cry-y-y
I can't wait till you're back, back in my arms again

So baby, baby
