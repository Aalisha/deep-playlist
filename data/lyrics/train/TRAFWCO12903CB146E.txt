(Blind Willie McTell)

I want somebody to tell me, answer if you can
I want somebody to tell me, just what is the soul of a man (yea)

I'm going to ask a question, answer if you can
Can somebody out there tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

(Ooo Lord)

I've traveled to different countries, I've traveled to foreign lands
I've found nobody to tell me, just what is the soul of a man

I want somebody to tell me, answer if you can
I want somebody to tell me, just what is the soul of a man
I saw a crowd standin’ talkin’, I came right up on time
