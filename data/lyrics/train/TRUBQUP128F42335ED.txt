So you made a few mistakes
You're not alone
People mess up every day
Take a knife from out your back
And send them home
You don't need them anyway

So you thought he was your friend
You told him all
Now it's all that you can do
To just sit there by the phone
Wait for a call
That will never come for you
It's not your fault, you're wonderful

And now you've done it again
What more can you say
Just turn and walk the other way
Sometimes some things just fall apart
...
