verse1 (Woody)
I'm gonna stay to myself
Where there's no one else around me
I'm gonna stay to myself
So that no one else can find me
That's what I'm gonna do
My baby love if I can't have you
Maybe I'm better off on my own

verse 2 (Jazz)
If I pray to myself
Maybe God above will hear me
And if it is in his will
Then he'll send you right back to me
I'll hold my feelings inside so that you won't see me cry
I hope it's all in my mind cause I'm scared.
