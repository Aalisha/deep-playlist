All these broken dreams
have made me see.
That I'm strung out somebody rescue me.
Well, do I have to tell you that I love you.
Do I have to tell you that I care.
Do I have to tell you that I need you to be there.

'Cos in the middle of the night.
When I'm much too weak to fight.
You know you're such a welcome sight.
In the middle of the night, yeah!

On the boulevard of broken dreams.
Yeah, I talk so bad and I act so mean.
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
I gotta get back on my feet.
