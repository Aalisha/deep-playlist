Time after time
As I look over my life
How I've survived, I don't know
I've leaned out over the edge
Into the darkness, and yet
You've kept me from falling below
God, You know I wear no badge of honor
Despite the way I hoped that I would be

Take me as I am
Take me as a man
Who's waiting
Yours for the molding and making
Take me as I am
Just an ordinary man
Whose heart is aching
...
