Ay….Ay….Ay….Chea….Ay ….Ay….
Let's get it

(Verse 1)
These niggas just hating they ain't talking bout shit
I'm a grown ass man I flip my own brick
I don't need yo help I can own my own dick
Ain't no muthafucker help me write my rhymes
Ain't no nigga pay for my studio time
See me at the top and want to claim my fame
Nigga took my chain yea motherfuckin right
You better off saying a nigga took my life
Want to assassinate my character but I ain't acting
It ain't adding up so you niggas subtracting
B.I.G. said it first more money more problems
The why I see it more problems more money (whatsup)

I got the streets on lock
Atlanta on my back
I do it for the hood
You got a problem with that
Real nigga so this rap shit easy (when I speak)
Theses niggas believe me
cause bitch I'm Jeezy
(x2)
