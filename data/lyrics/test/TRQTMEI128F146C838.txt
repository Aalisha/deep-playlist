David, ah, you shouldn't do that
And maybe, well as a matter of fact
Gotta have responsibilities
And try your very best to please the wolves at your back

Don't go telling me
that everything must have a reason
Because you're wrong, 'cause you're wrong
'cause you're wrong, wrong, wrong
There's a whole world out there waiting for you
if you'll just stop dreaming
Wake up soon

And now Jimmy, oh, come on, listen to me good
Because life don't come so easy
Who told you that it would?
Oh, so many people tell you what to do
And you believe them, that's the trouble with you
Just think for yourself!

And don't go telling me
that everything must have a reason
Because you're wrong, 'cause you're wrong
...
