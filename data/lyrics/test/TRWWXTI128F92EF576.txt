What you don't know won't hurt you
But will kill you in the long run
I'm sick of wasting all my time
As I slip through your fingers

You got what I need
You led me on
You got what I need
You got a hold on me

I'll keep trying but I'm losing my patience
I can't even take this anymore
And I'll keep trying but you're, suddenly changing
I can't even take this anymore
You nail my heart to your front door

This time I won't let my guard down
(Let my guard down)
This is a story about a girl who ran
Ran so far away
