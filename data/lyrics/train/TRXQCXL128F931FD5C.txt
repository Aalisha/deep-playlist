You see life through distorted eyes
You know you have to learn
The execution of your mind
You really have to turn
The race is run, the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
