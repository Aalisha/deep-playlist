Letters alone won? t do, baby, can I get a glimpse of you
Don? t tell me no, not this time
Baby girl, I cannot help myself, I want you and I need no one else
Tell me the place, please, tell me the time
Baby, the suspense is killing me, I can't wait forever
And if you let me slip away it wouldn? t be so clever, so

Baby, can we meet so I can light your fire?
Baby, can we meet 'cause I? ve got what you want
And you? ve got what you need?
Baby, can we meet so I can light your fire?
Baby, can we meet 'cause I? ve got what you want
And you? ve got what you need? Come on, come on
