[Intro:]
Now how you do it baby do it [x2] yea yea yea
Now how you do it baby do it [x3] woa a woah
Listen aye

[Chorus:]
Nothing but love and affection,
And it's really a lovely thing (Such a lovely thing)
So glad I've made you my selection,
Girl your my everything, my everything.

[Verse 1:]
Never knew love like this,
Girl I must admit
Ever since you came into my life,
It's been more than a few years,
Still no one compares
