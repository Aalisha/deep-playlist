In the distance
They are circling
I watch them go around and around
Never tiring
The one near death is hypnotized and closes it's eyes
One last time
Patiently they wait for that perfect moment to descend
And pick to pieces a once healthy
Body of passion and life

It's me or it's you and I get to decide
Which one lives and which one dies
Where and when
How and why
Here and now
A vital organ plucked out
Because I need to survive
Self-sacrifice is suicide
...
