Free me, free yourself
A life of sacrifice controlled me
But those promises I made
No longer hold me
Mercurial more wayward by the hour
The shackles fall away I'm in your power

Free me, and free yourself
Come to me and let me lead you
I beg you, I beseech you to let go
My heaven is yours
And heaven is all I know

We are mortal
In the hands of God who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses and passion
