Whenever you awake and find your kingdom life is great
May I suggest a simple remedy to make your day
Open up your windows and then open wide your eyes
Let the vision feast upon a golden yellow sunrise

You might be aching 'cause the one you love is far away
Thinking it's impossible to make it through another day
You can feel better take it from me
Just look at the colors of the fine autumn leaves
Let them put you at ease

As long as we have the weather
The dark skies will find us
Will send the clear day to remind us
As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us
And the rain most surely will find us

God created chang in seasons not in vain
The beauty of the weather's here
For sum distraction from our pain
Let the warm summers night mist you
Let a winter snow fall entranse you
