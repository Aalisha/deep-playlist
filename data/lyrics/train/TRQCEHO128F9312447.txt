He's always trouble with his non-complacent
Shotgun eyes, shotgun eyes
His subtlety, his mystery
Not like the other guys
She's always taken by his reputation
He's so bad, he's so bad
On Saturday night they're running for the shadow

You say your heart ain't ever been broken
You think you know where you're goin'
Tidal wave, tidal wave
Come rushing over me
You say this life is giving you nothin'
You got another thing comin'
Tidal wave, tidal wave
Come rushing over me
