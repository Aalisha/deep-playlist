Fall to your knees,
Accomplishing nothing
Fall to your knees only to exercise your schedule,
Abandon calender

What has come with such preaching is loneliness

Achievement: Zero

Forward can't be stopped, it just goes to show that some words are useless,
it just goes to show that some words are useless,
Take all your medals,
Take all your ribbons,
...
