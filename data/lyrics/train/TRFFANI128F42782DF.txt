I don't know what makes me hard for you
I don't know what I'm about to do, yeah

I don't need this anymore
My head is broke my eyes are sore
And man you wanted everything
I never wanted anything from you

What can I do, I don't need you
Now that it's through what will I do
What's it to you, I can hate too
That's what I'll do, what about you
