(Billy Currington, Brett Jones)

Sometimes they look brown
Sometimes they look blue
Always they offer a beautiful view
Into the soul I'm connected to
No one has eyes like you

They dance in the light
They sing in the dark
They pull me together
They tear me apart
Im jealous of paper when you read the news
