Baby the harder you work the further you get with me (With me)
I think you can
I think you can
Turn up prepared and make sure that you can keep up with me (With me)
I think you can
I think you can

But, be aware I always get what I deserve
Keep your focus keep your nerve
Ready, set, go

Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta
Work, work
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on baby get to
Work, work
You know you gotta
Work, work

I tend to get what I want so are you starting to see (To see)
I think you do
