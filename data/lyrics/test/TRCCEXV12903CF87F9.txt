Down in the street just waiting for a bus
This cop comes up, their giving me the SUS
They said? Hey sonny, I think you're in our file.
Well, you better come with us for a while'

We got you on SUS
You look to obvious
You better come with us
And don't make no fuss

We got you on SUS

So they shake me down
Try to make me look like a clown
I just stare at the ground
