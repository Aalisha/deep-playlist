Every night I see you standing on the corner
Shaking that thing like you're playing Pop Warner
Touchdown turnaround, play by play keep the score
Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for

I never knew you
(Don't give up on me)
I never knew you
(Don't give up on me)
I never knew you
(Don't give up on me)
I never knew you
Threw so hard

Touchdown turnaround, I never see you around
Anywhere or anymore, you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround, everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and every time, I am yours and you are mine
