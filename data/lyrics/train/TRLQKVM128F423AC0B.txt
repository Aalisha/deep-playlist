Who will feed the hungry if we don't?
There's people losing their lives 'cos we won't
If we believe but we still do not follow
Then maybe we don't believe

If we could only love this world like we've been loved
Then all the world would know what love is really made of
We live in plenty, there is more than enough
For what the world needs but not for our greed

Another world is possible, yeah
Another world is possible, yeah
The revolution's far from over
It's not over, it's not over
