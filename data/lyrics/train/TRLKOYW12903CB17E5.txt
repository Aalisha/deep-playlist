She'd just run when you raised a hand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
She was just too young then to understand
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Came home drunk in the middle of the night
Screaming and swinging with all of your might
But a child couldn't put up a fight
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)

Poor little girl she had to grow up quick
She ain't a child no more
(She ain't a child no more)
Her heart's still soft, but her skin got thick
She ain't a child no more
...
