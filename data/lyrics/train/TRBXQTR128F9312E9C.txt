Oh, here's a little song for everybody out there

People try to take my soul away
But I don't hear the rap that they all say
They try to tell us we don't belong
That's alright, we're millions strong
This is my music, it makes me proud
These are my people and this is my crowd

These are crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy nights
These are crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy nights

Sometimes days are so hard to survive, oh yeah
A million ways to bury you alive
Hey, the sun goes down like a bad, bad dream
You're wound up tight, gotta let off steam
They say they can break you again and again
