Good morning day
Sorry I'm not there
But all my favorite friends
Vanished in the air

It's hard to fly
When you can't even run
Once I had the world
But now I've got no one

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
Drown
