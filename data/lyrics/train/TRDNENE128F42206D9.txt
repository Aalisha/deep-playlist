I put it to you
How exploited do you feel?
I put it to you
You are not as determined as you once were
Silence the critics I may have found the answer
Cancel your subscription to love's young dream
Your duty starts here, end this guilt ridden sleep
'Cos like it or not I'm a map of the consequence
Silence the critics I may have found the answer
This race is never won
Just listen for once
You must stop, you must stop

This is not revolution rock you hear
Revolution rock
This is not revolution rock you hear
It's something much less complex

Wake up - take hold
You should admit the problems we have
Focus on the truth at hand
But never expect this to save, to save you
Just break the news
Cut the explanations in half
I put it to you
This change could be instrumental
I put this to you
