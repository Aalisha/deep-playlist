When I was 7 they said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was okay
They said you're more beautiful

And that's the way, they show that they wish
That they had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous 'cos

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you, so are you

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
