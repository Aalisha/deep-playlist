We'll meet again, my dear, on Doomsday
Pigs will be flying through the sky
On the 12th of Never, at a quarter past Forever
Stricken with the Rapture, we'll watch the world's demise

We'll meet again, my dear, on Doomsday
A hint of Armageddon fills the air
Now that Hell has frozen over and the sun is growing colder
