Girl I want you
Right where you are
Just hold it there don't move
My shining star

You must not know
Exactly what you mean to me
So deeply, completely you got me
And I'm needing your love, love

When you're feeling lonely
And you need someone to love you babe
You can always trust me
'Cause baby I can take you high

Whenever you need me
Girl it can be just you and I
'Cause girl you are so lovely
So tell me can I take you high, high, high

I've been meaning to tell you goodbye
But I can't seem to let you go
...
