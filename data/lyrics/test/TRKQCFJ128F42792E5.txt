I bit my tongue in the ark of conversation
I don't know why, I don't know why
I met you once and I'd fallen for your notions
I don't know why, I don't know why

Do you believe that there's treasures in the ocean?
Did I say I'm just a boy?

One kiss from you and I'm drunk up on your potion
That big old smile is all you wore
Girl, you make me want to feel
The things I've never felt before
