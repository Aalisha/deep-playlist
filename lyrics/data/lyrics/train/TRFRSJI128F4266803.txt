hello to you hello to me
i've somewhere else to be
excuses i get all the time
your answers i don't see
today is easy isn't it so?
i sit and watch the radio
there's nothing coming on at all
hello to you hello to me
ah yeah i really care
i'll see you all around sometime
i hope that i'm not there
today's news is yesterday's news
you don't remember you forget
