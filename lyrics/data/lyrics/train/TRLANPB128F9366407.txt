When I was small
My mama told me (my mama told me)
Whatever you want to be (whatever you wanna be)
You can do it (you can do it boosie)
Aiight
I said aiight mama
I'm a do it

Look

I send this out to everybody with dreams
Who trynna chase they dreams by any means
You might wanna be a lawyer a doctor
Whatever
Do whatever you want
You can do it if you put yo mind to it
Talkin' rap stars trap stars
If you work hard
You can be the best at what you doing
That's a fact boy
I know you from the hood
Shit don't look good
But that don't mean you can't make it out
Be in a nice house
Keep ya head up
Never say you can't
Love yourself if you feel nobody loves you
