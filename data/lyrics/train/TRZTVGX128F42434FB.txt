Sands of time stream through my fingers
Chasing lost days of a dead dream
And I don't care if we lose it all tonight

Cause I'm not sure anymore if it ever happened
It feels so unreal

Don't close your eyes what if all disappears
Am I better off all alone?
The truth is more then your brain can handle
I won't hate you anymore

First time I saw my father's tears
I knew there was still hope for me
