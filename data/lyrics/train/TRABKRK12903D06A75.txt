Been tracking in all my thoughts
I can't find the principle
My heart canâ€™t stop racing I see your face
I fall apart

I feel everything
This is the first time
Everything seems fine since the start
I've been waiting so long

This is the falling anthem
For the first time
Can't stop this thing from happening

This is our falling anthem
And it feels right
