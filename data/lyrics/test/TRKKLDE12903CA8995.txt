They say what goes around comes around
What I once lost can never be found
Oh, how I held you tightly
Oh, how you stood beside me

Got to know
(Got to know)
Do you think of me?
I got to know
(Got to know)
What you mean to me?
Do you think of me?

What can I do to make it home without you?
When you say it? s okay to spread your wings and fly away
