Line 'em up, go, that's what she said,
When the lightning struck,
I couldn't see the difference;
Time to let go of Russian roulette,
God's the only one who knows how we are not dead!
Out the window, but don't waste it,
'Cause falling on the floor is overrated,
Over the rainbow, I'm bleeding,
What I wanted isn't always what I needed!

But you're whispering so loud,
With words that never die...

I remember everything you said to me,
The words you spoke, they burn,
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul,
I remember everything you said to me,
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
