There is a silence that paces us all
It's sensitive to the peace that we've known
And if I could take that crevice in me
I'd fill it up with all that you bleed
I was walking into the water
and I was trying not to breathe
I could feel the current pulling
and I just kept in deeper
I'm sick of the pain that you're feeling
It's weighing you down
