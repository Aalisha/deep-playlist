Voices in the shadows, whispers in the night 
Telling him that vengeance will make everything all right 
Tortured as a child, condemned by all his peers 
Thoughts that have no reason and a heart that's full of fear 

Caught between denial and delusions of his mind 
No mercy in the system, there's no place left to hide 
Crazy like an angel who has fallen from on high 
Filled with rage and violence, he will not be denied 

A twisted world of killing and crime 
The handiwork of Lucifer's kind 

On the streets of madness 
The predator rules, stalking the night 
On the streets of madness 
The demons alive 
...
