Do me wrong songs make money all the time, the time
But your fine chocolate ass brings nothin' negative to mind, to mind
And the sun shines laughter when we live as one
And there? s peace for those who believe in love

I? m so glad we? ve come together again
Been thinkin'? bout you, where you been?
I? ve been waitin' here on needles and pins
And I? m so glad we? ve come together again
And I? m so glad we? ve come together

Bad news makes the front page all the time, the time
But the positive? s in small print on page 99, 99
The sun shines laughter when we live as one
And there? s peace for those who believe in love
