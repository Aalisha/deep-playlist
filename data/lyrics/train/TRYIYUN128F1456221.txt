Dr Livingston I presume,
stepping out of the jungle bloom,
Into the mid days sun.
What did you find there?
Did you stand awhile and stare?
Did you meet anyone?
I've seen butterflies galore.
I've seen people big and small.
I've still not found what I'm looking for.

We're all looking for someone.
We're all looking for someone.
We're all looking for someone.
