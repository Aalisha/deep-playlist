Brewing my potions, it all boils down to this:
what's wrong with me
and why do I feel this way?
I would really like to be the source
of someone's misery
I would really like to mean everything for
someone... just like you

I thought I was the classic definition
of a lone wolf
It is kind of irritating
being this self-deprevated fool
oh... "twist of fate" we call it
when everything turns inside out
she renders me in tears, then leaves
saying: "I've lost faith in you"

Free speech isn't real
...
