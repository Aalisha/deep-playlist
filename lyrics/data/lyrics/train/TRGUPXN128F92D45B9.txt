Cryin', ain't goin' down this
Big road by myself
A-don't ya hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Lord, ain't goin' down this
Big road by myself
If I don't carry you
Gon car' somebody else

Cryin, sun gon' shine in
My backdoor, someday
A-don't ya hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Lord, sun gon' shine in
My backdoor, someday
A wind gon' change all
Blow my blues away
