I've been lookin' at things in a negative light
Clippin' my wings in the middle of flight
My motor is running on the heartaches of life
But it's gettin' me nowhere fast.

I've been relivin' hurts that seemed far away
Siftin' the dirt that covered the grave
Of the petty offenses I never forgave
But it's gettin' me nowhere fast.

I will remember not
I will forgive
These things that tear my heart
I will forget
I will forget.
