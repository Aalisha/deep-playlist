I know you're waiting in the wings I welcome you my stranger
We live like rats anyway so this moment I must savor
If you could only touch me
And feel what I am feeling
Scars form like Braille on my hands
Moving like maggots when I try to reveal them
I am only scared because
I myself am scary
If it wasn't for the roaches in the wall there'd be
No one
Who could
Stand me
I see you there alone and just waiting
I welcome you as a friend do please do not
Betray me
