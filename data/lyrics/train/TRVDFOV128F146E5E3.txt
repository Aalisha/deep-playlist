I've got a friend he's a pure-bred killin machine
He says he's waited his whole damn life for this
I knew him well when he was seven-teen
Now he's a man he'll be dead my Christmas,

And so,
Everybody's gone to war
But we don't know what we're fighting for
Don't tell me it's a worthy cause
No cause could be so worthy

If love is a drug
I guess we're all sober
If hope is a song
I guess it's all over
How to have faith
When faith is a crime?
I don't want to die

If God's on our side
Then God is a joker
Asleep on the job
His children fall over
Running out through the door
And straight to the sky
I don't want to die

For every man who wants to rule the world
Will be a man who just wants to be free
...
