In a race to get out of this place
I am checking my face in the back of a spoon
You're accusing - you say I'm not here
But I'm here, yes I'm here, I'm not on the moon
I'm leaving so soon

Don't presume to know shit about me
'Cause I don't know myself
From one day to the next
And I don't pose perplexities purposly
'Cause it isn't a game - it isn't a test

And now hey, you
Could you give it a rest?
Just take me home, come on
And get me undressed
Put on the fire
And make it enough -
Oh, we're geeks
But we know this is love

Nine am to the beat of a drum
As we drive through the canyon
I'm feeling the hum of the engine
...
