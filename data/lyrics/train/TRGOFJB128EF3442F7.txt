Was at the end of my rope, had nowhere to go
Was at the end of my rope, I had nothing to show
Until the day I turned to You, was at the end of my

What?
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
You call me crazy
You call me crazy
You call me crazy
You call me crazy

You call me crazy, man, you make my day
My state of residence was disarray
At every party and as far as anybody knew
Everything was cool

But the truth was bottled up inside of me
I was as lonely as a man could be
And my 200 friends couldn't fill the void in my soul
It was a giant hole

Nothing made any sense
I thought there would never be an end
Then love came knocking at my door

Since I met You, I've been alright
You turn all my darkness into light
Since I met You, I've been okay, I've been alright
(Ya know I've been alright)

Since I met You, I've been okay
You're rolling my winter into may
And since I met You, I've been alright
I've been okay
(Since I met you)
I've been okay
(Since I met you)
