Deep inside your life,
there is a void to fill with what you cannot find.
Lonliness finds you, you find there is a need, there is a need to kill.
But who's life is at stake here now,
when did your own life become such a threat to you,
you lookd around, is there nothing left, nothing left for you to do.
Is this the end of you string?
You find a welcome mat of death's sting.
