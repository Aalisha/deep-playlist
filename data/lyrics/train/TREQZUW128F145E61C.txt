Foot stomp for unity
Foot stomp for unity

Ooh yeah yeah yeah

Slow down the walking place
Parasites fighting in an auter space
War mongers can pull we under
Yet empathy can make we stronger
Soon the voices all must say
Here it comes it's judgement day
We the offsprings of man
Distant cousins to the land

Slow it down
