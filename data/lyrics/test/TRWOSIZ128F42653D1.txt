I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame
With a little bit of luck and a hug there's gonna be a big change
I've got a strong desire to start the kind of fire
That'll burn through a pouring rain
I'm gonna find me a new way to light up an old flame

I've had all that I can stand
I've got roses in my hand
Got odd feelings in my heart
Now I'm knocking on her door
