i can bring your mind back to life
shake yr head til the sweat runs free
yr due for a rezerection
yr jaded beyond belief
who do you run with honey?
why do you act this way?
big brother's watch has ended
we're gonna make them pay!
This prison earth was not for me
but where were we to go?
the information that i sought
was not for me to know

i walked a million miles
i was shot down in the street
they tried to take us out
before the mission was complete
