I will rise from my bed
With a question again
As I work to inherit 
The restless wind
The view from my window
Is cold and obscene
I want to touch
What my eyes haven't seen

But they have packaged our virtue
In cellulose dreams
And sold us the remnants
Til our pockets are clean
Til our hopes fall 'round our feet
Like the dust of dead leaves
And we end up lookin'
...
