If I dont pick up the phone like I used to (for you)
dont you take it personal
if I dont do all the things that I used to do (to you)
I aint mad at you
if you get to feeling stressed up in your chest
thinking that you about to lose
(baby its true)
and if you losing out on sleep

if you dont know
now you know youre gonna miss (my love)
and i aint stressing bout a dog gone thing
cause i was true when i gave you (my love)
if you search you will never find another love like (my love)
youre gonna miss me
i aint got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)

if you think i caught a feeling
when i heard about that other chick (no)
i already knew about it
