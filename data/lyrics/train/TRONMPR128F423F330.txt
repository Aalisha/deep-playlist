There's a big old hole
Goes right through the sole
Of this old shoe

And the water on the ground ain't got no place, it's fine
So it's only got one thing left to do
Just creep on in
Creep on in

And once it has begun, it won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

There's a silver moon
Came a little too soon
Oh for me to bear
It shines brightly on my bed and the shadow's overhead
Won't let me sleep as long as it's there

Just creep on in
Creep on in
