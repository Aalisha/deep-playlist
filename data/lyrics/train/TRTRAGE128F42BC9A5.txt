Let me hear you say hey hey hey (Hey hey hey)
Alright, now let me hear you say hey hey ho (Hey hey ho)

I hate it when a guy doesn't get the door even though I told him yesterday and the day before
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab and I have to pull my money out and that looks bad
Where are the hopes? Where are the dreams?
My Cinderella story scene

When do you think they'll finally see?
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me, never

Like it or not even though she's a lot like me
We're not the same
And yeah, yeah, yeah I'm a lot to handle
You don't know trouble, I'm a hell of a scandal me, I'm a scene
I'm a drama queen
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen
Alright, alright
Yeah

I hate it when a guy doesn't understand
