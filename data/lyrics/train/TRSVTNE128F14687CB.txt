Verse 1:

Maybe we can talk it over
And save our hopes and dreams.
Though the waves seem endless,
Somehow we'll cross this angry sea.

With love all things are possible,
If we just believe.

Chorus 1:
I need to know, (yes, its' okay).
Can I hurdle this storm, (yes, but only together).

With love in our hearts, (the only way),
Somehow things will work out just you wait and see.
