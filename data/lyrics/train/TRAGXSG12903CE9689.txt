Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale
i speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like ajail
vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night
this killing of veggies is madness, i say we take up the fight
salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a facist regime
don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radishcan't scream

Chorus:
i've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)
watching their skins being peeled (having their insidesrevealed)
grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)
how do you think that feels (that it hurts really bad)
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go)
it's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell)
