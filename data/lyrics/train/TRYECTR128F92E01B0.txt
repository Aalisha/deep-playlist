(feat. Chali 2na (Jurassic 5))

[CHORUS: x3]
Here we go, here we go, here we go, get your guards up
Knowin' we got the sweet science

[Rasco]
I, enter the ring
Touchdown ready to swing
My footwork quick hit y'all with hard licks
I'm Cassius Clay
Y'all niggaz be the last to spray
I'm here to whoop a niggaz ass today
So I, tighten the gloves
The world 'bout to show me some love
I work hard better put up your guard
I spent time out in the yard, I'm here to train me and my squad
My head straight baby me and my God
Techniques obsolete, I want the crowd up on they feet
The world champ that they couldn't defeat
Me and Charlie 2n, PLATOON!
Y'all cats better give us some room
I sidestep then I lower the boom
You cats better call your goons
Tonight 'cos I've entered the zone
