I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast

And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now

Gonna open my eyes
And see for the first time
I've let go of you like
A child letting go of his kite
