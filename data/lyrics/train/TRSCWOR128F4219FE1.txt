i find myself
searching for the soul i once had
watered down the smoke inside me i've become a no-mad
there's been no body oh for sooo long now
i want me back but i just don't know how
well it's the same old story of a young boy
he's a, one filled with dreams
whoa but the fortune of reality
was a ripper adversy

if he's gonna make it
he's gonna do it on his own
well he's one strong mother fucker
he's toppled the sides alone
