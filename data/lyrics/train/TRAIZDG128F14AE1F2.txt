It's like a breath before the dive
It's like the truth after a lie
This flight is taking over
Searchlights in every corner
Like I love you when you're gone
Escaping in the dawn
I swear we'll flood your city
No choice it's what you're getting

If you want to breathe will you just let me know
If you want it, then you'll see it, let me know
Wash away the tears, will you just let me know
Need to see it, then you'll want it, let me know
