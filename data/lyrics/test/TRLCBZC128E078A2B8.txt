I loved you, before I knew you lied
I've always been right here
So, don't you try to deny
I've been right by your side

Then you started to tell the truth
About all the girls you knew
I was already over heels for you
I just don't know what to do

Oh, I, I try but I can't shake you
Oh, I, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you

Leave me alone, stay out late, but don't even call
As long as you come home.
Tell me you love me, when you don't at all
...
