Maybe your heart is aching
I wouldn't know, now would I?
Maybe your spirit's breaking up
I shouldn't care, now should I?

Maybe you're thinking of me
Well, I don't know, now do I?
If only you knew how I feel
Wish I could die, now don't I?

I'm just another crazy guy
Playing at love was another high
Just another high

Couldn't believe in my eyes
You drifted into my life
But marriages, made in Heaven
Can they survive in this life?

Surely it came as no surprise
Love was too hot to handle
Well, I really blew my cool and you
You just blew out the candle
