I've never been superstitious
I've never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me
I've believed in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

CHORUS
Well I'm haunted by a memory
That won't leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I swear i keep seeing shadows
