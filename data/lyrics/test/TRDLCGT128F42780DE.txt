No footprints before me
Will I be the one that finds a way?
Our fate unfolding
Is there something more then the roles we play?
How deep the roots dig
And they sink into my skin
I see myself in the cracks of your foundation
And these walls will crumble by our hands
We don't talk much anymore
And we're not letting down our guard

We are not alone
Everyone is lost
