Boy you dropped a bomb on me a long, long time ago
And all I ever wanted was to love You Baby
Something sacred in my life, a flame to burn, a candle bright
I want to stay just for your loving baby (?)
Known so many others in my life, none like you
No one else can make me feel the things you do
And if I had the chance to do it all again
Id do it cause youve always been my true love and my best friend

You Baby, You Baby, You Baby
(All I ever wanted was)
You Baby, You Baby, You Baby
(All I ever needed baby)
You Baby, You Baby, You Baby
(Understand me child)
You Baby, You Baby, You Baby
(Hear me talking to you)

Looking out the window when I woke today 
I wished you all the finer things the world could give you daughter
Sunshine on your face, good health, prosperity and grace
And time to reap what youve been sowing, love and laughter
