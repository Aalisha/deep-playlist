And the words of the song say everything
when I switch on the radio

Because it brings back all the memories
and it seems so long ago.

Oh
but there's a rain outside on the window pane

Is it cold inside your heart?
If I don't get back to you somehow
I know it's gonna tear me apart.

Once again
let's give it another try

Because I need you back in my arms and then
Once again
...
