Brakes on, brakes on
The car is running empty
Brakes on, brakes on
The car is running empty

Downhill, head on
This crash is coming slowly
Downhill, head on
This crash is coming slowly
Move.

Or watch the slow death rob your way of life

The science to fear
It plagues my mind
And keeps us right here
And it keeps us here

My ears, my eyes
My brain is slowly busting
Black smoke, red sky
...
