Forget About You
It’s been one year to the day
Since I watched you drive away with only street lights glowing
Here we are now face to face fumbling all the words to say
Hiding feelings that I don’t want showing now

I am useless young and stupid for thinking I’ll get over you
I’ll make excuses but the truth is
It’s the best that I can do
I can’t forget about you
