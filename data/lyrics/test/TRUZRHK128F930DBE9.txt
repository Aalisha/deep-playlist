Here's a little tune we're gonna play for you,
There ain't nothin' to it and it's easy to do:
Called the Calloway Boogie,
It's the Calloway Boogie,
Keeps you groovy twenty-four hours a day!

If you like music with a boogie beat,
Here's a little ditty that's really all reet!
It's the Calloway Boogie,
It's the Calloway Boogie,
...
