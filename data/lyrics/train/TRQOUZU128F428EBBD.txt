Day and night I wonder how you're feeling
I wonder if you'll ever change your mind
I don't know just what it is you're dealing
But I know you've got me in a bind

Day and night I wonder how you do it
Put me in this awful state of mind
How on earth can you be so unfeeling
How on earth can you be so unkind

Well I'll be fine with you in the morning
If you'll be good to me tonight
I'll be fine with you in the morning
If you'll be good to me tonight

You never want to sit and talk it over
You always want to run right out the door
Come and sit right down here on the sofa
Tell me baby right now what's the score
