I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
(How much longer? How much longer?)
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
(How much? How much? How much longer?)
She broke her leg and she needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her

Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X
(How much longer? How much longer?)
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X
(How much? How much? How much longer?)
She got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next
