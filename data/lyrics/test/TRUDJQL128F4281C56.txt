Please don't get me wrong
See I forgive you in a song
We'll call the likely lads
But, if it's left to you
I know exactly what you'd do
With all the dreams we had
Just blood runs thicker, oh
We're as thick as thieves, you know
If that's important to you
It's important to me
I tried to make you see
But, you don't wanna know

You don't want to know
If you pipe all summer long
Then get forgiven in a song
Well that's a touch, my lad
They sold the rights to all the wrongs
And when they knew you'd give me songs

"Welcome back", I said
The blood runs thicker, oh
We're as thick as thieves, you know
...
