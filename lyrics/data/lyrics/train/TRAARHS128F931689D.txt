ohhhh ohhhh
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type

It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open

I guess that changed my mind
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time

'Cause they calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point

That was one lonely night
The star maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down"
