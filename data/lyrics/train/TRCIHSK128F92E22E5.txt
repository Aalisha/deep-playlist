What do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass by be sure to drop my bag
Come 'round and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end
Right through to the end
Right through to the end

What do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass you should drop my bag

But I don't have no clothes to clean,
to put inside the machine
