She wanted him to know that she believed in him
And her friends all disagreed with the choice she made
She decided to risk it all on a hunch she believed in
They tried to stand in her way, in her way

We won't give them an opportunity to divide and conquer us
Let's show the strength and passion 
that connects, that connects them to us

These two star crossed souls are in the same state of mind
They'd rather follow their heart than other peoples' lies
If you separated them, they'd never be satisfied
Death is eminent but such a sweet lullaby
