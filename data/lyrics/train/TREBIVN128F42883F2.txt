I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't want to lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
Though we may change

Who do you think you are?
Who do you want to be?
You're the only one that really knows
Maybe you'll be surprised
After your search is through
Then you'll find you'll find you've just been chasing you
Believe me I understand
The visions of your mind
But I'm so afraid that the man you find may not need a girl like me

I don't want to lose you
I love you as you are
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't love you more
Tell me love will remain
