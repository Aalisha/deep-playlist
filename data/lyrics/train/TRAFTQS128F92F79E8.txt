Chorus:
What will it be then, give me the reason
Conclude what you feeling
We set the record straight homie it can't wait
Addressing the direction millions take
So what's next?

We elevate above the highest pinnacles and cynical characters
Mimi on you amateurs, just so ya'll can feel our flow
Our style's eclectic, nah it's labelled profound
It maybe hard to swallow, best believe we hold it down
Don't knock, we rock, stop, drop cause we hot
Roll wit what you know got you sold cause your man's not
Worth your wait in gold, in here you hold your own
Spit game like Coaches act like you know

Because it's been a long time coming but now the time has arrived
But sorry im late man just finished 9 to 5
This game ain't having no breaks man I got's to get mine
Before your rewarded you put forward your passion an time
It's time to use my head upstairs and be rid of the crimes
Undo all of my ties that be upon my life line one day we'll
see the sunshine see through your disguise
mean while I'm stepping on my foes blown up like land mine's

Chorus:
What will it be then, give me the reason
Conclude what you feeling
We set the record straight homie it can't wait
