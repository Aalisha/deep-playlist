well don't touch me baby your finger tips they feel like pins across my skin
just light another cigerette so i don't regret inviting you over
well don't hold my hand or i'll punch your face i'm a hungry rat in this hole i waste
thers no blood to taste in this awful place
i'm mainlining murder

mainlining murder baby
