[C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah! (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.)

I got flavor like Adobo, you ain't know though?
My rap go back like quack delioso{?}
Señorita, señorita - TEACHER!
What'chu gon' teach us, except to be weaker?
You go bo-bo, I go BO-BO-BO!
BO! BO! Like Jamaicans at a gun show
Where you from loc', actin tough like gung ho
Pull the gun like bums now - COME OUT YOUR CLOTHES YO
What'chu think the flo' is fo'?
So you can fall when I throw blows
C-Rayz, you ain't know I'ma pro?
My style is rough canvas, a-rhythematic
Flippin the script, now your chick, want a sip of the tip
Tell her chill, I'm celibate kid
Remember my name - like the elephants did
Shake the place, 'til I break your face
Or you can catch a DDT like Jake the Snake, c'mon

[Chorus]
If you love it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
If you need it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
If you got it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
