Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire on my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat

Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears

He's just like the water, the water

Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind

Filling up the cup of my emotions
