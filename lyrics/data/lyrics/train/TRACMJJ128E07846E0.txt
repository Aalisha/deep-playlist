Would you wake up on the hour,
Get the kids up,
Get them ready,
Do the washing up,
Press their clothes,
Get them dressed,
Plait their hair,
Cook breakfast.
Run them all to school,
Go home and tidy up,
The mess around the house,
While I don't give a fuck,
Could you handle roles reversed?

refrain:
Well, could you live the life for me?
