I'll be there for you

Looking in my memory, what did I see?
All the good times you gave to me
Even from the park, way after dark
Listen to the radio in my car
It's times like these you see the wood from the trees
You come to my aid when I'm on my knees
Next time you feel alone, just pick up the phone

Reach out and touch, whisper my name
I will deliver again and again
Straight from the heart, honest and true
I promise you this, I will be there for you
I'll be there for you

When I think, I'd be lost without you
Makes me wonder what I did before you
When it mattered you were there for me
You were my rock boy, you were my energy
