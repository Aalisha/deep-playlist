Brilliance of my fleeting mind
Chimes like voices in foreign caves
Chimes in time
Takes me where I'm going
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing
Believe it when I pin it down

That's not hard to forget
With my hands upon my knees
You will steal from my fleeting mind
Remember all our words
They are just smoke rings in the rain
That's just a poem in brilliant places
