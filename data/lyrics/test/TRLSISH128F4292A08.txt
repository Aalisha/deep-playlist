You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
I've got your name on my credit card
Now I go shopping shopping

I know I was born with an expectation
At rainbow's end, there's a pot of gold
Who's gonna pay for my reservation
For whom will I keep my love on hold
You thought you could count on my devotion
Thought you could play with my emotions
I ain't gonna let things go your way
You're still gonna hear me say

You broke my heart
And I go shopping shopping
You broke my heart
