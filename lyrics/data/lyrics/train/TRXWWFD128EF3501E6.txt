Outsidaz' Night Life

[Young Zee]
This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white C-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, it's on the Night Life EP

[Axe]
See, Axe the trife type, live the Night Life
Amongst dark alleys and bright lights
A heist might, end it all for the right price
Guess who's back in the house, Axe and the Outs
The wack crap you yappin about get you cracked in the mouth
Wanna be president, put me in office
My old? ran for European horses
Skiing off cliffs, G'ing off this
Rob banks, clearin Porsches
Me and Nawshis, y'all shoulda been being cautious

[Nawshis]
My Night Life'in, make cats get liars
When Axe pass the striker, I rapid fire
Nauseous, I'm main coursin', no appetizer
The emcee sacraficer, like a rap messiah
Run up on you, 'specially if that balls sellin
Catch him on stage, get put in a full nelson
This the O-U-T flow, for rappers finito
But'cha girl could get the EP tho'
