Dreamed I was in a desert without any luck
Storm gray clouds, hovering above
Silence all around me, I was wandering alone
And I realized there is nothing anyone can really own

And I wished for guidance, and I wished for peace
I could see the lightning somewhere in the east
And I wish for affection, and I wished for calm
As I lay there nervous in the light of dawn
As I lay there nervous in the light of dawn
...
