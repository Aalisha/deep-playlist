She said I don't think I'm gonna let you walk on me anymore
I don't think I'm gonna let you let me care if you slam the door
You made me so confused even when I win I lose
But here comes that feeling creeping in

Hello, goodbye, she wants to stay, she wants to fly
This room, this bed, too many thoughts run through her head
Of where she's going and where's she's been
Fade to black, start again

She said I don't think I'm gonna let you put me down anymore
I don't think I'm gonna even let you know
...
