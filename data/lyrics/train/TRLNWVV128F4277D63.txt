Grievances reached no words to be said
Barrier breached now come lay your head
And she's found a new way her hands letting go, hurting so

You've too much to say your new words heard old, letting go
Down on your knees it's a long extra mile, letting go
Giving your faith just for a smile

Finding some way to go crawling back again
She wonders why, boy didn't run
Remembering two who had something special then
Sometime, someday there'll be only one

Passages preached, notions of warmth
