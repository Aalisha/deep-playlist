I'm tired of the eggshells we've been walking on
We've been here for far too long

Remember standing on the pier
Even the ocean couldn't come between us
Now the sound of your words seemed so turned around

Last time I should have said I'm sorry
But all my pride made me keep ignoring
That the deadline is up when the sun goes down

If I could catch the words before they left my mouth, I'd do it
If I could reach right out and turn them all around, I'd do it
But it's out there yeah I said it
