I'm in love with the sunshine
I'm in love with the fallin' rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leavin'
Leavin' life and all your pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again

I found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt there was nothing to hide
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carry all my love
...
