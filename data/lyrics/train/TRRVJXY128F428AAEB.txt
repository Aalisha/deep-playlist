Something's gotta change again
I'm losing
My inspiration's gone
Oh no, oh no
Seeing through some different eyes
I can't find
My medication failed
Again, again
I can feel a change, I can feel, can you feel it?
See it on the street
Watching heat from the pavement

Cause I'm here
Ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day
