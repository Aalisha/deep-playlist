She was a waitress down in New Orleans
She had a broken past
He worked the oil rigs over in Corpus
Out on a weekend pass

He sat down at the end of the counter
At the little cafe
They weren't looking but they found each other
Or did love find them, either way

Tell me who is dealin' up the hand of fate
Is it true, love is always worth the wait
And it's never too late
It's never too late
