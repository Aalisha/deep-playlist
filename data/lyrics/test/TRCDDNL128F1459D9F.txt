There's a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off the souls that are lost and cryin'
Rails of sin only evil remains
Watch out brother for that long black train

Look to the heavens you can look to the sky
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same
Burning your ticket for that long black train

Cause there's vict'ry in the Lord I say
Vict'ry in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his holy name
...
