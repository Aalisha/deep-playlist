Miscellaneous
That's Me"(feat. DJ Clue
[Cam'Ron]
I'm not going to watch this go on any longer
You put my food in the dark
and expect me to look for my plate on some Mr. Magoo shit
Fuck I look like
I'm not going to watch this go on any longer
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Clue]
we going to set this off

[Cam]
I'm on ya'll
Harlem, who else is going to hold us down
Bloodshed niggas
lets get it right this time
understand
Killer

Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daqueri's
Like it's all good down at the hit factory
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me
all that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery
I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet oozies
And I can't act, turned down 3 movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast
My rude ass, carries 3 weapons
And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts
imagine me wake up 7: 30 for work (what?!)
I'd rather run the streets 7: 30 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order
Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter
Tell me it's the man, can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties
Got her damn handy
How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy
