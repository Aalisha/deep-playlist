[Without you, yeahCome on]

It took a long time
But I'm back again for good
It really hurt me
But now I finally understood
The day I left you
Must be the greatest in my life
I hear without you
There's only peace around, no fight
I tried so hard to
Oh doing everything I could
Manipulated
Made to think I was no good
In your possession
Every day was a bad dream
So na√Øve then
Well I was young and sixteen

Oh...
He was my honey
He was my honey
Happy without no honey
