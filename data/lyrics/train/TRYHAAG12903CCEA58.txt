Can't handle this life anymore
Point in the mirror and I ask what for
Just a miserable monster or part
Dangling at ropes' end good start

Crumbling down - into a mess
I've got too many problems - that tell me I'm less
Than the good god - who watches above
Who'll damn you to hell - and then tell you to love
