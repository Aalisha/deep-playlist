Tonight I finally get the chance
To show you what I'm feeling
So now I'm taking out the time
To know you and your latest trends

Don't even get me started
On the topic of lovers eyes
Their attempts are so off-target
They don't know what is it to try

Baby, save me
Tell me that you wanna take me
To the place where we kissed the sky
Rain by day, shoot stars by night
(X2)

Now that we made it up into the sky
I've been wondering why
Why can't we keep away from everything
Stay high, just you and I
