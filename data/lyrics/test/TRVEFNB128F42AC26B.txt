(Hook)
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss, you know that I will
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts, yes I will
A nickel for your kiss, you know that I will (listen)

Listen honey baby, there's something that I've
Gotta make clear
You may have had other lovers in your life
That can't compare to what's going down here
I promise I'll be (gentle), I'm gonna give you all
That I've got (got)
Don't say no, let your body go,
I'll do my thing nice and slow if you tell me your thoughts
...
