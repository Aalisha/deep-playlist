(Project Pat)
Hen-Hen-O-Sin make a playa sin/
Mix it in with that white and gin/
Here we go again/
Project Pat gotta keep a strap/
Haters know I rap/
Wanna shoot me in my gold teeth, blow me off the map/
I attack like a shark would/
Represent this hood/
North Memphis, nigga Hollywood/
Make it understand in my blood ain't no trakeness, or no fakeness/
And no hoe couldn't break this/
You can hate this/

(Crunchy Blac)
Dis Bitch that bitch, nigga here's the deal/
Crunchy ain't runnin' round' here fakin' deals/
Crunchy runnin round here tryna get a meal/
Why you fakin' a deal, it don't cost nothin to be real/
All ya gotta do is keep that shit real/
Don't be runnin round here hollerin you got deals/
Don't be runnin round here hollerin that you'll kill/
It don't cost nothin to be real, but it costs when ya kill/
