I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home to you
'Cause you can't live without me

Who left the door, the window gate locked?
Who did the didn't want me in?
Way back when I was just a psychopath
Come on, come on, come on and let me in

Whoa! They tell me I'm insane
Whoa! Just something with my brain

I'm a good boy now, good boy now
It's certifiable
I'm a good boy now, good boy now

I know, I know, I know you're in there
I know that murder is a sin
I know I'm better than I ever was
Come on, come on, come on now let me in
