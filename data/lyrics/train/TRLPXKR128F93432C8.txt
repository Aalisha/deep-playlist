Boyfriend
B b boyfriend
Boyfriend boyfriend
Boyfriend

So you gotta gotta boy right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
Cos I know we could maybe, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair

It's so more hard when I'm not right here with you
You make me do things, I don't want to do
You call me in and I know there's so much more
Why do you pick me up to kick me to the floor

So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
