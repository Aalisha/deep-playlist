If I was only made of wood,
I wouldn't have these feelings,
you'd say goodbye,
and I would never know this pain
I'm going through, but
I was made for you.

If I was only made of sand
I'd drift through other lovers,
and then with time,
I'm sure that I could even be as good as new, but
I was made for youâ€¦
