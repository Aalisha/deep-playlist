reborn, in another place
vanishing without a trace
daylight in another time
disappear without a sign
restore what we had before
vanishing expired law
a clear view of a fallen dream
the one we will never see

well waited a life time to make up your mind
wait for the right time for you moment to arrive, to arrive

reborn, in another place
vanishing without a trace
daylight in another time
