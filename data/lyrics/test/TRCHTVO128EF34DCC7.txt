I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
The mark of the beast is on a president
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen

Round the bend, vesting supernatural force
While babies with open mouth holler and shout
Shed tears for food, to eat day and night
Ethiopia is calling, show your African pride

I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
