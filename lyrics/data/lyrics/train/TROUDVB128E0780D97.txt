Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions,
Are something we don't share?
I don't want to be sitting here,
Trying to deceive you
Cuz you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

We can not live together
We can not live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start
Every time that I look at you,
I can see the future
Cuz you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go
