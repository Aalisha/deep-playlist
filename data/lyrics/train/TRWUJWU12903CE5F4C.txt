I just wanna thank you for everything you see
For every clever word I say, for my golden opportunity
For stoking the fire, for my creativity
For burning up the wires just when I needed someone to talk to me
For bringing out the courage and stirring up the rage
For showing me that loyalty is a phantom on a page
And I'd like you to know that I never really gave
I never really gave, I never really gave a fuck about you
A fuck about you, a fuck about you, a fuck about you
I just wanna tell you though I've never seen your face
...
