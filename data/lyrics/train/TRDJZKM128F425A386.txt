I'm a stoned lone flunky that didn't kiss your
ask me questions, i didn't pass your test
i'm the poster boy for delinquent debauchery
Im incognito, got my al capone sunglasses
i'm the babylon night crawler
with a prima donna on my wing
Gonna make some noise before i die
and shoot the bullet i loaded
can't catch me if you tried, anyway
I'm gonna live my life with no remorse or sorrow
the devil made me do it and i'd do it again (do it again)
don't care if i slip into a, into a grave tomorrow
Cause when i go out i'm goin' out with a bang
(out with a bang)
Freeze, this is a stick up in your
ask and thy shall receive a sentence
