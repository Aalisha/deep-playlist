I been working double shift all night
Bees make honey, I'm making mine
Good men are busy all the time
I been working double shift all night

My line of work suits me fine
Split that apple and chuck that rind
Pull no wishbone that ain't dry
My line of work suits me fine

Sweet you ramble, sweet you roll
Through the bedrock of my soul
I got more good luck than I'll ever use
All day and all night like a mule
