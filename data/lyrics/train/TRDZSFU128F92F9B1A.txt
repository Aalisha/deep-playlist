Can you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind?
In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold
Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind?
Time after time we stood united on we go

FLY far away, don't let the world pass you by
LIVE for the day, we must stand and survive
Now we face the judgement day, our souls will feel the pain
Hear the screams of my world through the rain

Silent fields of despair, my tears in the rain
...
