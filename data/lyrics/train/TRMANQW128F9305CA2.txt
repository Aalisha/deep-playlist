I can't figure you out
But a heart must be the one thing you were born without
I'm through wasting my time
I don't know where I'll sleep tonight

You say that you can do without me
Go ahead now, try and live without me

Baby, save up all your tears, you might need them someday
When the tears start to fall, I won't wipe them away
When you cry in the night for the love that you need
Baby, save up your tears 'cause you'll be cryin' over me

You got used to my touch
I got used to not feeling much
Winter set in your eyes
Time will melt your castle of ice
