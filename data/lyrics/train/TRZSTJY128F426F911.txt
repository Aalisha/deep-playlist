Gotta go...

i really wanted to take you with me
on my little country journey
but you have to understand, oh why
and not sit alone at home and cry,
and cry, alone at home and cry

even though you're not here by my side
truely you're always on my mind
so i just called to sing a lullabye
to comfort your heart so you never cry

i really wanted to take you with me
on my little country journey
but you have to understand, oh why
and not sit alone at home and cry,
and cry, alone at home and cry

i really wanted to take you with me
on my little country journey
but you have to understand, oh why
and not sit alone at home and cry,
and cry, alone at home and cry...

tell her not to worry you'll be okay
