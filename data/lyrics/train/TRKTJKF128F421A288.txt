I don't wanna go out with you tonight,
I just wanna stay home and fight.
Nothing sounds more fun than what we do,
Can't imagine more fun with you.
Do I remember what fun you can be,
No - it's been too long since you've had it with me.
Why would I want to have a good time
When we can stay home and not spend a dime.
It's always fun to be with you
And never have anything to do.
Why go out when we can fight,
It's what we're used to every night.
