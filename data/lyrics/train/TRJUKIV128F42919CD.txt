The A.M. finds me home alone awake in bed
Morning blinds me, had that dream of you again
Fog is lifting, I realize that you're not here
And how you left me, life disappeared

Life is rejection, I know you've had your share
But this one's special, I can't compete with her
And did she tell you only she could know your mind?
And did she sell you? I gotta say it one time

She can be your lover
She can be your friend
She can be your vision of a mother
Like the one you never had

She will know your troubles
Better than I can
But she'll never be your man
She'll never be your man
She'll never be your man
