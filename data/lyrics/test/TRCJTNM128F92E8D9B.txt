I was talking to a cat the other night, 
He said what everybody is looking for, 
what everybody's looking for today, 
they're looking for Escape-Ism. 
Heh. Heh. 
Ain't it good to you? (Band: "Yeah") 
You know what? I love to get down, Jack. And when I get down, y'understand, I don't have to go into no funny bag... (mumbling) say, that alcohol, I can't, y'understand, yeah. That's the way I feel. 
You know, I believe I'll get down right about here. (BOBBY BYRD: "Right on") Byrd, if I get down-- y'know Byrd, Byrd's gotta, Byrd's gotta, I mean, Byrd's gotta out of sight tune coming up. We gotta record for him right here, y'know. So we're trying to get our thing out of the way before Byrd can get into it.
