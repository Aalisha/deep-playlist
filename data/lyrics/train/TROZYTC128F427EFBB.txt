Well you can just believe
I'm the only girl in your life
I'll be your sugar in the morning
And the sweet stuff you need at night
And you can just make believe
When it comes down to makin love
I'll satisfy your every need
And every fantasy you think up

CHORUS:

So when you need a little peace of mind
Come on over boy, anytime
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
