When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl

Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evil's abound

In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites

Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep

Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip

Now you are mine
In my control
