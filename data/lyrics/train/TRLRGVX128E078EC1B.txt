[Eminem Snortin Crack]

[TV Presenter:]
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?

[Door opens]

[Hailie:]
Daddy, what're you doing?

[Beat starts]

[Eminem & Hailie:]
Ok then! everybody, listen up!

[Eminem:]
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?

[Hailie:]
Somebody, please help him!
[giggle]
i think my dad gone crazy!

[Verse #1:]
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
[Hailie Makes Chainsaw Sound]
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off

[Dr Dre:]
