Digital, display
No smoking
No smoking sir
Digital
Does anyone have any time to play?
No smoking
Does anyone have any?

1, 1, 1 no smoking
2, 2, 2
3, 3, 3 no smoking sir
4, 4, 4

I could go on counting for hours, the things that I like
Please don't move baby stay right here, stay right inside
I don't mind if you turn your back on me, cause I know you're still good
Even if I wanna turn on a light, in this position I don't think I could

36, I always dreamed of your measurements in neon lights
24, at Christmas baby maybe you can light up
My room and brighten up my nights, 36

I never had a girl before with much of a figure
So excuse me if I start to play with your digital display
