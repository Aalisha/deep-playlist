I can't find a way to escape
From the depths of where You found me
I cry out for a Savior
Take me on to higher ground
Oh, take me on to higher ground

Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith on Heaven's table land
A higher plane than I have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground

I don't want to live life down in the lowlands
I still want to climb that mountain
