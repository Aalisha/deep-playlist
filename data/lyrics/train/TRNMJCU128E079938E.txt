Yeah, every little thing

The sweeter you taste
The bitter I feel
The slower I play
The quicker you deal
Your hand on me

The softer I stroke
The harder you ache
The less that I give
The more that you take
Your time (Take your time)
Take your time with me (Take your time with me)

You can't stand it
Just because I won't let
You step over me, oh

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me
You want every little thing that I don't
