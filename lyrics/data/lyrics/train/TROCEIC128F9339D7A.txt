- lyrics as recorded by The Dave Clark Five

Ow! You don't drive a big fast car, no
You don't look a-like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes, Oh! to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
But oh, oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh whoa-oh-oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Ow! You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress in the best of taste
