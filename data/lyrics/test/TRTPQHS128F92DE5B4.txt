If you want someone who will turn your head
Whoa oh, I'm your woman
If you want something that you ain't found yet
Whoa oh, I'm your woman

You don't know but you just found it
Come on baby think about it
If you want something that's real
I'm your woman, I'm your woman
I'm your woman, I'm your woman
