(Intro)
Yeah
It's the sound of Philadelphia
Yo, yo

(Verse 1)
Welcome to the home of brotherly love
Brothers covered in blood
The man's office is covered in bugs
The youth dreams cut short, swept under the rug
Love for self is outweighed by the love for the drugs
Go Eagles, McNabb and T.O.
We ain't hard to find homey, just follow the weed smoke
We eat rolls of greased beef soaked, overweight and evil
A city of justice unequal
The shadow of New York we still under
So we gotta kill 'em every summer, walk a little tougher
Guns bustin' how we chose to fight
When you can go from bein' a star to a scumbag overnight
Streets often deserted on the coldest nights
All hair trigger thunderbirds show you're right
Cops don't ask if ya know your rights
Hopeless hypes smokin' pipes
Pavement gamblers rollin' dice
...
