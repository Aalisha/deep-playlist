Among us all who live inside the town's eyes
Oh - tell me what's the catch?
We harbor dark in the light...
I can see young ones in the park
With smiles they're playing
(high on dreams)
I need to feel real - just like that
How good you are!
We live in paradise...

The park lies by the high-rise
Casting shadows cold and dark
A lonely face in the window
Seeks to cloud their dreams
She envies the light of his ways

How can I stand in peace and watch as
The will to smile has gone
How can it be?
