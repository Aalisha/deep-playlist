i keep my eyes on the screen
pulse oximeter flash in indistinct green
tapping of the veins haemoglobin rains
bloodbath now will occur

pressure of the blood is set to be relieved
tappping of the veins haemoglobin rains
heart is being disturbed

violent deed, sickening greed,
transfusion of obscenity
losing track, eyes turn black,
departure of my sanity
