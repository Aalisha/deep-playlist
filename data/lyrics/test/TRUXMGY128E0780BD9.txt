I'm to the point where I can't take no more your immaturity
It adds ton frustrating like those things you say
Actin' like you ain't feelin' me
Your boys come around then you start thrillin' me

Gonna let you know how I feel today
Ain't gonna take your shit
Ain't gonna sit and play your games
No more, no more, no more

Gonna let you know how I feel today
Ain't gonna take your shit
Ain't gonna sit and play your games
No more, no more, no more

We both know we can work it out
So lets just let it go, no use in stayin' around
No take it slow today is done for sure
And let it go, let it go

We both know we can work it out
So lets just let it go, no use in stayin' around
