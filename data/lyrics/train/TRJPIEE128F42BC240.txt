Stone cold sober, 'bout to get knocked out
Wanna party hard, wanna get real loud
A girl over there damn near passed out
And that's what happens when you're in the crowd

Somethin' 'bout to make me get it up
Don't have to tell me to get fired up
If I don't move now I might erupt
Get fired up
Fired up
Fired up
Fired up

All the girls on the floor
Better get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
Boys on the wall
Better get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
All my girls at the bar
Better get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
Stop gettin' with mine
Better get fired up

Get fired up, fired up, fired up
(Panting)
