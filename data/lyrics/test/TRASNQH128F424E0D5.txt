So many people who live in my town
They mind to my business they've none of their own
They are so happy now that I've done wrong
I'm surprised they don't come up and thank me

So if you have moral advice
I suggest you just tuck it all away
'Cause my mood to burn bridges
Is not unlike my mood to dig ditches
Don't cross me on either a day, baby

Don't make mistakes or be human
