And I promise you there's a paradise
And I promise you there's a paradise
Where it's never raining and the music's playing everything's alright
And I promise you there's a paradise
You start to jam if you agree with me
Let's come together we're family
Pay close attention if you lean on me
Cause if you flow you know it's like I set you free
Pop is always feelin' night romancing
Searching for love so keep on trancing
Here is the question if you feel real nice
I promise you there is a paradise
And I promise you there's a paradise
And I promise you there's a paradise
Where it's never raining and the music's playing everything's alright
