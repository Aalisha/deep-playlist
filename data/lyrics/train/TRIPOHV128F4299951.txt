Darling
What do you take me for
Some kind of fool who believes
Begging on my knees it's gonna bring you back
I know it's not a fact

Darling
Something inside of me
Tells me that you made up your mind
Nothing I could find
Nothing I could do
To influnence you

I gave you my heart, I gave you my soul
Didn't I, didn't I?
I gave you my heart, I gave you my heart
Didn't I do it

Darling
Guess I need a love that will last
Yes I need a girl I can trust
Honestly so much
Searching, searching, love's always hurting
