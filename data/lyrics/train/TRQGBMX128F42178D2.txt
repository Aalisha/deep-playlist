Some people will go for years, without ever finding their place
Not us we are the lucky ones, for we know who we truly are
Not privy to abstract thinking, reality's a trusted friend
Not giving in to idealism, we'll stay real 'til the end

PUNCH THE CLOCK!

I don't ascribe to things, being tougher these days than the days before
People have been getting by for years, on mental toughness and the grit

Hey we're just workers, confident and realistic, we know where we stand
Hey we're just workers, not going crazy over events or current trends
Staying focussed on our duties, and good times 'til the end
...
