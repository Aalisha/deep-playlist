Crazy little mama, is your heart still meant today?
Feeling alive in some peculiar way
Baby come home
Baby come home

Pretty little woman, please come back today
It's just gotta be wrong to throw my love away
Baby come home
Baby come home
Baby come home from heartbreak city, yeah

First Avenue
First Avenue
