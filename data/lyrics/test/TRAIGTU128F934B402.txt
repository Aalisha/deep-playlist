Bound and gaggd in a black pot
Seared and flavoured with herbs and salt
Marinated slowly in a secret sauce
Roasted and served as sumptuous course
They dribble and drool as I try and get loose
Stewing slowly in my own juice
Rubbing their tummies and licking their lips
Devoured me up and served with chips

By the time they're done there'll be no one left around
Just a special bus full of mutants geeks and downs
We'll be beaten tender so we taste real nice
...
