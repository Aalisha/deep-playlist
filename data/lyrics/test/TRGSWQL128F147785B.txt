There was a time when I was alone, no where to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon and even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night I closed my eyes, I saw a shadow flyin' high
He came to me with the sweetest smile told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Run run lost boy they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe, believe in him and believe in me
