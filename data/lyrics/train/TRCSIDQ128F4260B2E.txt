With satan's hog no pig at all, and the weather getting dry
We'll head south from altamont in a cold blooded travelled trance
So clear the road my bully boys and let some thunder pass
We're pain, we're steel, a plot of knives,
We're transmaniacon MC

Behind the pantry, behind the tree, the ghouls adopt that child
Whose name resounds forever, whose name resounds on terror
...
