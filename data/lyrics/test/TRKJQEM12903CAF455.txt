I never will, ain't never gonna
Stay out with a man like that at home
I never will. I never wanna
I'm faithful to him

The way his hands caress my body
I lose my control and let it go go
Let him run the show show

Ooh, he pulls me closer
All that I can do is make sure that I breathe

My man, irresistible
My man knows the way to go
He got, he got what I desire
He got, he got my head on fire

My man, intellectual
My man, so seductive, oh
All I want and all that I am
...
