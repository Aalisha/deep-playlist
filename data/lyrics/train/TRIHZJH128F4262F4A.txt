One more time and you'll be dead
Least I think that's what they said
Forty days won't break a man
Was a bullet in his head?

There's something in the
Something in the way you were
The pain so wrong my friend
Revolution, revolution man
Imagine all the people

One more time and you'll be dead
Least I think that's what they said
...
