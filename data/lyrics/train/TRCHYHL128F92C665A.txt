I hit the bottle baby, I lost some time, I did it all 'cept get you off my mind. I gave the act a cleanin', Dry as a bone, You beat the shakes, you break, pick up the phone. Just to win back my baby's heart, And to tell her I would never tire, Let it ride, yet you know it's wrong, Bein' the love that you know is gone
