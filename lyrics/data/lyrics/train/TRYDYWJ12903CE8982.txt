If I find you are pretending to be in love
You'd better hide deep in the streets and run love
Sharks are tearing at my flesh in the sea
They don't give up
They're thirsty
They're hungry

Hard on the floor makes it harder to touch
Now I can move with a sweep and a crunch
Now I see you violent and dirty
I wanna be like sex can sweat
...
