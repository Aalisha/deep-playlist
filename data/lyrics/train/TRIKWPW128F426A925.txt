If you need some transportation
From a world of tribulation
Tell me your destination
I'll be, I'll be your ride

If you're out of inspiration
All you feel is desperation
Consider this an invitation
I'll be, I'll be you ride

We'll get a running start
And we'll take to the sky, baby
Ride, keep your hands on the wheel
And your eyes on the prize and ride

And when the world that you've created
Has got you feeling tired and jaded
...
