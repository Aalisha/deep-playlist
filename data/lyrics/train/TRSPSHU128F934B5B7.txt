Yeah, I'm running off the rails
I've finally gone crazy
And the ground is spinning faster
Than my teeth could ever grind

I know it's a shame
When success was to blame
But I can't remember my name

In the absolute wrong
I have made this place to lay my head
A reoccurring nightmare
I never trust, I never rest

I've become another victim
Of this self-serving device
My cock does all the talking
...
