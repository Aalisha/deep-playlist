It's getting late, your eyes are closed
And mine are wide awake, but still,
I can never go on, I can never go on like just like
I'm begging just to see your eyes again
I can never go on (I can never go on)
Should I even care that you didn't say anything
I tried to do my best, should've given her better things
Like rings... and roses...

Never do reply when I hint the message
I try to smell my best with a bottle of essence
Getting to the point with style and romance
And I could never go on, I could never go on

[Chorus:]
