I'm not sure anymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
Now the places that I knew
Jah mon tis so sunny and blue
Now I-man can ah see it in the sky, sky
Tenor Saw has already die, die
Ah mi seh mi oh mi oh my my
I say I man haffi feel it and I man haffi cry
When them ah go stop kill off them superstar
Bob Marley die, Jacob Miller die
Them kill Tenor Saw and them dus' out free I
Now they want to test the Apache, I, I
But Desert Eagle will have to fly, fly
Nuff man have died, ah mi say nuff man a died
Nuff man ah died, ah mi say muff man have died
Massa God, mi seh don't ask me why
Many more ah go suffer many more ah go die
Jesus Savior wha dem crucify
Man dem fling him pon de cross an' all dat crucify
Crucify Jesus, fi save ya weh
I'm not sure anymore
Who is knocking at my door, door
Now the places that I knew
Jah mon tis so sunny and blue
Now I-man can ah see it in the sky, sky
Tenor Saw has already die, die
Ah mi seh mi oh mi oh my my
I say I man haffi feel it and I man haffi cry
When them ah go stop kill off them superstar
