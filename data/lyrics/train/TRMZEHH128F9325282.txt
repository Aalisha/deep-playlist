Youre just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank god I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eys off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
If you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
