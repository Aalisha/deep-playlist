C'mon feet, start movin'
Got to get me there, owww

Hey hey, uh huh, huh, huh, huh, oh
Uh huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah, oh

Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad, huh

But I got a woman waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see she's got the kind
Of lovin' and a kissin'
A make a man go stone wild

So I got to keep on walkin', mmm hmm, huh
I got to walk on, oh ho ho
I-I-I-I-I'm so tired
