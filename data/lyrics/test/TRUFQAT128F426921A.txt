Just the way she smiles and says hello,
I can't help but let my feelings show.
I'll hold her hand and tell her things I know she wants to know.
(La, da, da.) I will never make her blue.
(La, da, da.) I will never be untrue.
We are in love, and we'll keep it this way.

Never been so much in love before.
Now I am, I want it more and more.
