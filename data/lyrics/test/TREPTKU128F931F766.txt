That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy

But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name

You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

After I hadn't known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine
