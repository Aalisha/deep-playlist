I never know how to treat you
You think I love you but it ain't true
I'm walking away now
One step forward and back two

I like to grab you by the hair
and hang you up from the heavens

I don't know how to let you go
Or if i should keep you
I don't know how to let you know
I really do have a reason

I like to grab you by the hair
and drag you to the devil
