My friend Goo has a real tattoo,
She always knows just what to do.
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care,
What she does best is stand and stare.

She can play the drums in tune,
And the boys say "Hey Goo, what's new?"
My friend Goo just says "P.U."
My friend Goo just says "P.U."

I know a secret or two about Goo,
She won't mind if I tell you.
