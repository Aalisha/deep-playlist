Afraid of the neighbours out in the hall
I'm worried they'll hear us come through the wall
Down in the car park, out in the street
Out in the real world people are mean
I live in a shoebox, I live in a cell
And hearing my small talk
It's easy to tell that I don't belong here
Just 'cause it works for you doesn't mean it works for me
I can't fall in love with every single idiot I see
...
