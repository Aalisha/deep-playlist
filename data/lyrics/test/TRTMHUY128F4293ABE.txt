Ride through the valley in thunder and rain
the battle is raging, redeem this domain
The Castle of Eden lies silent above
darkness surrounded us, away we must go

I look through the eyes of the world
I see there's a Stranger among us.
Awaiting a sign from above
to conquer the power and the glory

Enter the battle, our will to enchain
bringing us forward, defeating the pain
into the meeting with swords made of steel
we're standing together the secret reveals
I look through the eyes of the world
