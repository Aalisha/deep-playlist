You breathe and life begins.
You speak, and my world makes sense.
That's how it is,
When it comes to you.

Your mercy has no end.
You're more than just a friend.
It amazes me,
You feel the way you do.

I believe in You,
And nothing less.
I believe in You,
Can't help myself.
You're all the hope,
The reason that I need.

I believe in You,
Just because.
I don't need no one
To prove Your love.
For all that I have seen,
It's easier for me
To believe in You.

You are so beautiful.
You are the miracle,
That dries the tears,
...
