I'm in an empty room
I've waited here since noon
The walls are closing in
The room is getting dim
I'm feeling something wrong
But time is getting on
You've left me here alone
You're holding all I own

I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view
I'm sinking into you
I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view
I'm sinking into you
