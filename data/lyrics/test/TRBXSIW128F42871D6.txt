This temperamental side,
The one you say that you can't hide.
D' you ever see yourself -
The way it looks to someone else?
This temperamental trick,
The one you say you can't predict.
You're like an empty cup.
Forgive me if I don't wait up.
I don't get where you're coming from -
What is real and what's put on,
What has stayed and what has gone.
How long will this thing go on and on?
