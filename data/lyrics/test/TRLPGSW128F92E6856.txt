There'll be girls across the nation that will eat this up
Babe, I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
Get down to the heart of it, no it's my heart you're out of your luck
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love.
Love love love love.

I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts with her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start to make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of love love love love
Love Love love love

Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing worth trying to be and it's

Love
Love
Love
Love
I do it for Love
Love
