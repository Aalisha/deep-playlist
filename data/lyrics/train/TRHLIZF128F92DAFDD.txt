You're not doing this alone
You're not doing, you're not doing this alone

For my sweetheart the melancholic
You have crossed the River Styx
And the waves have taken you away

As I lay my head on your chest
I can hear it in your veins
Wake me up when you come to bed

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
This world isn't kind to little things
You're not doing this alone

Was my love not strong enough to
Bring you back from the dead?
If I could eat your cancer I would but I can't
You're not doing this alone

So I've been writing these songs for you
To steal you from your grave
We can dance in a front row again

So toughen up
Biko, toughen up
Biko, toughen up
I need you to be strong for us
