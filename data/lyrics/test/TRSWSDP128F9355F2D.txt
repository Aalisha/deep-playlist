Ooh.
Jeremih.
Yea yea yea.
Ooh.
Jeremih.
Yea yea yea.

Bring it.

Her hips waving the ocean.
In ways you wouldn't believe.
She swear that she got that potion.
Well I hope there's plenty for me.
Cause I been searching for somebody to cater, to cater.
Cater to all my needs.
And you look like your willing to do the favor, the favor.

So come with me and let me work that body [x4]. AH-OO
You know just how I like it naughty [x4]. Doo-Doo Doo-Doo
