I used to love her a long time ago
When things were fine now that's not so
So I'm searching through dark clouds for silver linings
I'm always searching but never finding
Look to my eyes, tell me what you see
I'm empty inside but a small part of me
It's listening to rumours and believing lies
That parts always searching but it's never finding
