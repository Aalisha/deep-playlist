As I make my move to the floor
There comes a feeling that I've never felt before
I am no longer your prey, I'm the predator

With every move that I make
I keep my hunting eyes on the game
And when my target is finally found, now it's time to play

CHORUS

Only one condition before I move
It Absolute submission no safety fuse
