Take a look deep in my eyes
More than a feeling - I call it pride when I know
There's a chance and I've got to take it

And I don't mind a bruise, yeah yeah
Baby I've got nothing to lose
It's only a crazy game

So I try, alone to make it
But it's good to know that you're there waiting
Right outside the door

Heading out on my way tonight into a fortress made of stone
To a place I've never felt alone, cause I know you'll be there
Heading out on my way tonight just like a king upon a thrown
So just hold my hand and I'll show you my second home... 
Down at the Place Vendome
