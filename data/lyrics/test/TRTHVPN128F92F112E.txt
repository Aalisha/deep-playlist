Wop wop wop, wop wop adada dada
Wop wop wop, wop wop adada dada
Wop wop wop, wop wop adada dada

You gotta scream, scream, you know what I mean
Put another dime in the record machine

Hey, we're having a party now it's just begun
We're all over here and we're having fun
Joe's all alone and he wants to be kissed
While Mary's in the corner and she's doing the twist

So let's shout, shout, knock yourself out
