Everyday in lunch in high school,
And all of my senior year,
I'd drink my Coca-Cola with a touch of everclear.
I never had to study math, science or history,
I'd have a chemical flashback to jog my memory.
In my junior year I swore I loved sweet Miss Sherrie-Ann,
One night I put some everclear in her Dr. Pepper can.
I thought it'd make her easy, but she took it pretty hard,
I took her home and rang her doorbell, left her lyin' in the yard.

Tequila dries me out, and beer just makes me fat.
Whiskey makes me nauseous, tell me who the hell needs that?
If you're thinkin' about drinkin', then the answer's crystal clear,
Its the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.
