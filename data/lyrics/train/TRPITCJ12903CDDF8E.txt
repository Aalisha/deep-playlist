It's gonna take alot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Run di track
ah dem wan fi try and hold mi back
mi say wolf and culture gwan to di top
ride di track
the riddim is sweet and di dancehall hot
crowd of people never wan we fi stop
run di track
ah we run di show
mi say we run di shop
we ah di don numba one and mi say we run dat
we ah the king inna di place
mi say ride pon di shock
put your hand inna di air we ah gon burn down di spot

It's gonna take alot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

And as I'm walking through the subway
All I feel is everybody's piercing eyes (piercing eyes)
I' m following the footsteps all I can imagine is that I? m a guy
You never know maybe she's afraid
