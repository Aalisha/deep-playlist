I'm losin' my edge,
Reflection's turned to white- like a ghost that's in the mirror,
It keeps haunting me tonight.
And as I lose my self-control, (lose my self control)
(I become a disaster)
Into the unknown
(I move a little faster)

You know that in the end,
(You're my favorite)
I'll relapse again.
(You're my favorite)
I'm down to my own tricks,
You're my favorite fix. (fix, fix, fix...)

When I come down, I can't replace the feeling
