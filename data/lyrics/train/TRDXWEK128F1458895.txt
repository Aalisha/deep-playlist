My perfect life
May deceive me tonight
Realize
Overcast skies

The humble man
May just finally fight
Realize
Frustration

Now and then
It seems to happen
Time to time
Snow in June

My perfect life
May deceive me tonight
Forgive me
I haven't been myself, lately

I may survive
If I told ya your advice
What you mean to me
