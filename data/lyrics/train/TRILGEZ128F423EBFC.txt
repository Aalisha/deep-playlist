This is where it all ends
And the kinda dream that you've never seen
Well, yeah

Hot damn, ooh, mercy ma'am
What the hell you doing to me?
Ah, strutting round with your head held high
What you trying to prove, girl?
Black haired missy
Big brown eyes
On my knees, mama please
I'm a regal man
I'll do what I can
To take you off to the promised land

I'm a sun king, baby
Let me take you by the hand
Sun king, honey
We can rule across the land
I'm a sun king, baby
With you, I'll share my throne
A sun king, honey
