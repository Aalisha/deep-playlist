Tie yourself to me
No one else knows,
You're not rid of me. No, You're not rid of me.
I contain?
I breathe, hah hah hey hey,
You're not rid of me. Yeah, you're not rid of me
You're not rid of me; you're not rid of me
I am you my, darling,
Don't, leave me, I'm hurting,

Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,
Lick my licks, I'm on fire,
Lick my licks of desire,

I'll tie your legs, keep you, against my chest,
Oh, you're not rid of me, Yeah; you're not rid of me,
Make you lick my injuries,
I'm gonna twist your hand to stay,
...
