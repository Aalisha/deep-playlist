He's my boy

He told your ass not once but twice
You hould've took his advice and left the man alone
You still drive by here every night
'Cause you're not wrapped too tight
When he left, your mind explode

You had your chance
And you lost a good man
I know it's sad
Thinking about what you had

If you were smart
Keep that ass off my car
Next time see me
I won't be your lady, no, no

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
(Keep your hands off my man)
(Keep your hands)

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man
(He's my boy)
Keep your hands off my man
Keep, keep your hands off my man
