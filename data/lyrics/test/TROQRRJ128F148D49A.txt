Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah
Eye-eye-eye-ah

You think you've got your way
But baby there's a catch
Don't need your foul play
Now you have met your match

You think you're in control
But that won't last that long
You thought you wore the crown
Honey, you were wrong

You had me taken in
But now I've found you out
And I won't go through that again

You've always had to win
You'll have to go without
You don't know where to stop

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
Think you're Mr. Know-it-all

Go, go, go, go, go
I'll get over you
You drive me crazy, up the wall
