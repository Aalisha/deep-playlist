Workin' that body body (x3)
She movin' that body
And when she workin' that body body
You gotta pause

They know they never could touch her
She's as hot as the sun
They can go on and try
The way she moves like a fast car
Got you turning your head
Wanna get in and drive

[Hook]
Oooh, baby baby
Zoom zoom baby
Speeding like a fast car (She moves like a fast car)
Oooh, baby baby
Zoom zoom baby
Speeding like a fast car

[Chorus]
You gotta love the way she rockin' that body body
She movin' that body
And when she workin' that body body
You gotta pause

She rockin' that body body
She movin' that body
And when she workin' that body body
You gotta pause

The flyest thing I've ever seen (oooh)
She's got a body like a dream machine
