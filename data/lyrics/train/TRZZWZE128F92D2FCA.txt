Boom...
I want your love,
Boom...
I want your love.
Boom...

Move it right up to me,
Like you know you should,
And make me know you're doin',
All of the right things...

Coz makin' lots of money,
And livin' in a dream,
Is when you know you're doin',
All of the right things...

Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it,
Push it, oh, don't push it...

Coz baby, I want your love,
I want your lovin' baby,
Baby, I want your love,
Boom...

Bet you think you're funny,
Just hangin' with my friends,
They make you think you're sayin',
All of the right things...
...
