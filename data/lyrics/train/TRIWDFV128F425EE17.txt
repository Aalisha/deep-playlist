It seems like years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom
You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me

He thinks I just became famous
And that's what messed me up
But he's wrong, how could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?

And there's millions of people
To offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted and they will never be
Any influence on me but you will always be
You will always be

If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
...
