The first time that I met you, you drove me 85 miles per hour
You said riding with the top down made you feel so free, gave you power
I thought your eyes were deeper that any I've seen
And then you hit me with your love machine
I said could we go somewhere and just be alone?
You kissed me on my cheek and drove me home

Once is not enough, when you kissed me baby
Once is not enough, when you hold me in your arms
It's never enough, I've got to have your baby
Once is not enough, I need you 25 hours of everyday
8 days a week, 25 hours, 8 days a week

I laid awake that night baby, I tossed and turned 'til a quarter to seven
I slipped off to la la and there you were and I was in Heaven
You put your arms around me and loved me so sweet
And then you drove me down to 7th Street
