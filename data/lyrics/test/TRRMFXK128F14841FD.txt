Hey 
Nananana woo woo 
Satnanana woooo

Aye take up all me money 
And swounder down de jail
Fly to upon man to meet dis young boy there
Make him influence her fa take a trip down to Spain
Tell me how in the world could this girl be
Me say she come back from Spain
Come back work again 
She have no money fa spend
What a ting
Now have the audacity
To see I passing
Talking about, hi honey do darling
Can I have a very few 
I replied with who ya talking
Me say gal you to bloody wicked ooohh (ya cheating)

Me say 
What a women, what a woman, what a woman me care 
She haffa cry back, she haffa cry back fa me
What a women, what a woman, what a woman me care 
She haffa cry back, she haffa cry back fa me 
Aye but I don't want her anymore

Me say dog is just a name, it's not me lifestyle
Listen to me girl child uhh ohh
Saying things to man fool
Ya check dey wrong file, yes ya check dey wrong file
Cuz I dont us to fight again
And dey high life again 
Not another night again
