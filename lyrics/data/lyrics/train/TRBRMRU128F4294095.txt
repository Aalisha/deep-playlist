Help me out here, cos I'm strung out
I can't go back there, or I'll burn out
Medic! Medevac me up
I've credit for you to blow out the dark

I hold out my hand, for you to help me down
Concoct me up good, I wish sombody would
I'm pacing ahead, can't shut down my hand
Like a ship in the night, like I'm losing the fight

Help me out here, cos I'm strung out
...
