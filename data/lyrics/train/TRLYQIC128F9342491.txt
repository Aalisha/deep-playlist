[I) The Dawn Of Steel]

[instrumental]

[II) The Pipes Of War]

This is The Story for centuries untold 
On a misty morning at the break of dawn 
Out of the night as shadows of Doom 
Black armours shine in the cold morning light 

They come from the mountains, they come from the seas 
They come with a purpose, a power to wield 
They're ready to die on the battlefield 
They're ready to die for the Sword the Gods forged long ago 

A sword is laying on an altar of gold 
inside a circle of magical stones 
Thousands of Warriors behold the Emperor 
As he steps inside the circle offering a sacrifice 

They come to kill, They come to fight 
Armies are raised one against the other 
Brave men are lead to death like lambs to the slaughter 
All of this just for one man's greed and pride 

[III) The Sacrifice Chant]

[Pre Chorus] 

Oh Mighty Gods of Chaos!
