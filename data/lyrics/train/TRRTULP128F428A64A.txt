okay, here's the story about my mom and dad
one was white
one was black
i bet you think you're glad
i'm a half breed, my skin is fair yet tan
i don't know what the hell i'm on
so 1, 2...1, 2, 3 slam!
kinky hair when i wake up
straight when i go to bed
my dad speaks jive talk to me, don't know what he just said
my mother she's a honkey
my dad's kentucky fried
i don't know what the hell i'm on
...
