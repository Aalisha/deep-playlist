You think that everyone's against you
You think the world's a conspiracy
Life is a movie about you
We're all supporting your lead
You've been up for a week or two
You've done everything with nothing to do
Eyes so big how do you see
You've lost all your personality

Spun Vacation, Chemical Noose

Completely lost and right in front of me
