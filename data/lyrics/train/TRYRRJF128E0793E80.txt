Alone against the world, twist a reckless life straight
Into the heart of the ripper
Trick of treat my mind to a rebel ride, Heldorado
Move like a monster

Creature of the wheel trigger wicked way
Tangle like a web beneath me
Ankle-deep in hell through another way
Crucify the sky above me
Above me, above me, above me, above me

New God kill machine and man
Say, Lord of the engines, yeah

Pocket full of dirt frozen in my hands
Hold on to the nameless God, yeah
Breathe into the deep and dying light of day
Overdose on bloody wings, yeah

Splinter in the skin, turn your eyes away
Sick and swaggering beneath me
