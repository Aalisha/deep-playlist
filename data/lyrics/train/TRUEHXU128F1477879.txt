How can I be sure
When your intrusions my illusion
How can I be sure
When all the time you changed my mind
I asked for more and more
How can I be sure

When you don't give me love
You gave me pale shelter
You don't give me love
You give me cold hands
And I can't operate on this failure
When all I wanna be is
Completely in command

How can I be sure
For all you say you keep me waiting
How can I be sure
