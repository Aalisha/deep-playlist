Unloose this hold you've got on me
Unlock this heart that can't get free
Unlive the night you kissed and hugged me
Undream the dreams that we both shared
Unfeel the feelin' that you cared
Before you leave me, please unlove me.

*Chorus*
Unlove me
Unmake all the memories I can't forget
Unlove me
Let me go back to the way I was before we met
