When I'm starin' into space You wonder what I'm thinking of No one's ever crossed my mind When I'm thinking about you, my love All my memories My special fantasies There's someone I owe them to Baby, it's you When I'm dreaming in my sleep Many worlds I travel to My soul is yours to keep I always will return to you Until we can fly away Go where the angels play Become a kiss from the sun to the day Baby Chorus: Ooh baby, it's you Oh yea Ooh baby, it's true Ooh baby, it's you Oh yea Baby it's you When I'm beaming of light So sure of myself and this place I'm in It's always fresh and new That something, I'm in touch again And it's no mystery How it happens to me You're the one I owe it to Yea baby
