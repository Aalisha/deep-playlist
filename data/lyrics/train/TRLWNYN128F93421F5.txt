Looking out my door,
I've seen this world before,
It's not like I left it,
Yesterday.

As for the fact,
That it cannot come back,
It doesn't really matter,
Anyway.

Turn on your eyes,
And look into tomorrow's skies,
Then look for the past,
A smile's all that really lasts.

There's a bigger play
...
