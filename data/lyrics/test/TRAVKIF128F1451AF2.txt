Nelson Algren came to Paddy at some party at the dead end alley
Yeah, he told him what to celebrate
And I met William Butler Yeats, Sunday night dance party, summer 1988
At first I thought it might be William Blake

We mix our own mythologies, we push them out through PA systems
We dictate our doxologies and try to get sleeping kids to sit up and listen
And I'm not saying we could save you, but we could put you in a place where you could save yourself
If you don't get born again at least you'll get high as hell

Yeah, and sweet St. Paul, that must be the hardest luck saint of them all
We met him at some suburban St. Paul mall
