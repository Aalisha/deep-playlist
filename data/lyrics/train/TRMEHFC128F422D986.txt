Good looking, Bad tasting
Full-bodied, butt wasted
Loose living, tight-fitting
What you see ain't what you are gettting
Big make-up, little break-up
She wants it, he's got it
Cold blooded, hot gossip
Superficial expectations

CHORUS: Look at me, you can take it all
Because this face is free
Maybe next time use your eyes and
look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your
thing, baby, I can even do reality
