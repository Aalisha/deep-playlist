My eyes eclipse as these stars constrict
And swallow me whole
Dislocate with your pretentious hands
Reciprocate through seeds of change
Deviate with feet of innocence, perceived through premonition
Times have changed
But still these words, your words remain

My eyes eclipse
Now I'm reduced to holding onto every regret
And the night sky has taken hold of me
