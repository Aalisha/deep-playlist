I could take every fucking word she says
Throw it in her face
But would she even care
I still remember when she looked at me
That frown upon her face
Trying to be sincere
I gathered all those little things she said
Kept them close to me
Trying to make this real
This cloud will alway hover over me
I'm leaving you today
'Cause now I see

Suffocate, you suffocate
You lie (I don't lie)
You're fake (I'm not a freak)
Suffocate, you suffocate
You always take (I don't take)
What you can (what I can)
