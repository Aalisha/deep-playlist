There must be something wrong with me
There must be something happening that I don't even see
Whatever it's gonna be
Oh it's just as well

I can't believe the state I'm in
I think I think too much and now my thoughts are wearing thin
Where should I begin
Oh it's just as well

And all I wanted from you
Love me like you wanted
I can't keep your heart if your heart can't be kept satisfied

I like to watch the sun go down
? on the other side of town
Besides you ain't around, oh it's just as well
