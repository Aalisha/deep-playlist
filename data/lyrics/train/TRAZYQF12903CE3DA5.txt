workin out really helped, take a look at me now, im in the middle of a
project on the brink of a breakthru, its on the tip of my tongue people
always make things harder than they are, sittin on yr ass wont get you
very far fallin off the wagon, help me get on up, im backslidin on ya
can't remember that big idea thats floatin in the back of my mind dont
try to feed me any of yr lies, yr problems might be big but its not
about the size.
the problem is solved, you cant believe, ill untangle any web they try
