With all the simple times behind me
I can fail without regret
If I have to try then I will never be able to forget
Bottoms down and out of reasons to hang around

And when the sun is over Hong Kong
I can tell you where she'll be
Floating in a soft and lonely melody, directly over me
Chocolate eyes at one time melting in mine but not tonight

She'll say, "I love you Paul"
"I love you Paul"
"I love you Paul"
Hey hey, hey hey
