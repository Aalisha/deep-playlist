Someone called out to you
And it sounded just like crying
On a street where nobody
Even knows your name
Your mind was getting high on the sweet air
As your spirit was flying

Steam rising from the sidewalks
Of New Orleans after an evening rain
Steam rising from the sidewalks
After an evening rain

And it only made the heat
Feel like it was walking even closer
As you headed up St. Charles
To catch a streetcar named Desire
