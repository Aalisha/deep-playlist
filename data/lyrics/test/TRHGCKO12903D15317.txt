Miscellaneous
If You Wanna Dance
If you wanna dance, this is our chance
If you wanna dance, let's take our chance

Jiggy-jump to the beat, and keep bouncin
Thirty seconds and countin
Hot one, this choice critical
Situation is difficult
My calibre won't allow me to rhyme
On a level where you people can't here me
See me, I guess you know you wanna be me
In the mean-time bounce to the beat see

Music is my life cos my life is music
The beat of the drum in your heart

Let's dance (like you mean it, can't you feel it, don't you know)
