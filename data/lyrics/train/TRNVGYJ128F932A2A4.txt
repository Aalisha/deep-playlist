I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passe.
But today, If you think that I don't know about depression and emotional pain,
You're insane.
And you're a fool who hasn't paid attention to a word that I say.
In a way,
I can't help but feel responsible, I always knew that you were insane.
With your pain.
