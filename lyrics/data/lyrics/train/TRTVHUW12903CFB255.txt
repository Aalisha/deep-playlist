Finger on the trigger
Let it bang bang, baby let it bang
I don't give a damn
Cause I'm a rebel kind
Watch me do my thang

Let me introduce you to my Lucy
I don't care if you like me
(I'll walk it out on 'em)
Running from the law
I'll hit the borderline
They trying to trap me
So let's get down baby

I'll be locking and loading
I'll be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at cha

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at cha)
