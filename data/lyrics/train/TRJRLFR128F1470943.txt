His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography

The lyrical virtuoso makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
LL Cool J is back again
Allow me toduce you to my friend Cut-Creator

He circumcises DJ's when he's on the airwaves
Til the mission's complete, you're a musical slave
English revision he endure any collision
Like a surgeon with a scalpel, he'll make an incision

As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll excommunicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter

Cut-Creator will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name
