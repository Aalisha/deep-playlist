I'm taken down with the fever
And it won't let me sleep
I'm taken down with the fever
And it won't let me sleep
It was about three o'clock
Before he would let me be

I wish somebody
Would come and drive my fever, away
I wish somebody come and drive my fever away
This fever I'm havin'
Sho' is in my way
