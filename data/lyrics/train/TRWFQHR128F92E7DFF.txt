And as the low aggress the high
All you can do is sit and cry
You've only got yourself to blame
Don't try to stop me it's too late
My mind's made up, this job won't wait
There's nothing left for me to say

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb

Hey! There's no need to debate
It's time to designate your fate
Take the M out of M A D
Let's all make a bomb
