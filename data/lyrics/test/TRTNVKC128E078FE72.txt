Two o' clock and I'm all alone, calling you on the phone
Wanna come over but you ain't home
Get in my car and start to drive, yes, we gotta take a ride
'Cause I feel lonely inside but

Then I ran into your girlfriend, know she is your best friend
And if we mess around our love will end
But I gotta take a sneak peek 'cause the freak in me is beating me
Telling me to creep see

I'm just wondering if you really know what's going on
Do you really have a clue 'bout what I'm gonna do to you, hey?
I'm just wondering if you really know what's going on
Do you really have a clue 'bout what I'm gonna do to you?

Now that were here alone, had to unplug the phone
Just in case she calls, she'll think I'm not home
...
