Hey man don't say I didn't warn you,
that southern California is some day gonna fall away.
Do it, but all in moderation.
It hurts my reputation, what used to be is gone today.
Look mom, I pulled it from the bedrock.
I've living off the rhymne rock.
A special kind of crime that pays.
It's time now, a thousand pounds of cargo.
It's what I gotta let go.
One. Two. Bombs away.
