If the things you do are not pleasing you
It's time to take another hard point of view
You take the things you've and learned
All that you know are real
And what you feel is your first concern
Make the sacrifice and make it right
Rejoice, Rejoice in the things you know are right
You better rejoice
Make you feel real good inside
