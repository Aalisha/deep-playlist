The engines spit out fire, I'm pushed back in my chair
The pressure gives me thrills as we climb in the air
And I love to watch the clouds and the mountains and the sky
Swish around a cocktail the stewardess brings by
Lord, this is the life for me
Lord, oh Lord, this is the life for me
But I don't wanna die in an air disaster
I don't wanna die on a plane
Well, I fishtail through the lanes, and I make my tires squeal
Power at my feet and glory at the wheel
And I wind the windows down, let the wind blow through my hair
...
