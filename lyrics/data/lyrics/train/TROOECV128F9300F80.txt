Fresh to death and dressed to digress.
I'm just a tiger and I'm lookin for a tigress.
My guess is that you might bless,
me with your holy water just like you were a pope baby.
You got me hangin from a rope lady,
just like a tire swing lovin you is tiring.

Hoold hold let me catch my b-b-b-b-b-b-reath
You can do me up like Woodrow Wilson, carry me children, exit the building
Let me love you like you are the shit girl
you are the shit girl x2
You can do me up like Bruce Springsteen, ask the swim team, pass the string beans.
Let me love you like you are the shit girl
you are the shit girl x2
