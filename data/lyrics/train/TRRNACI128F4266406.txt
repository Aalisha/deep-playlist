(cold 187um)
see it was seven o'clock
and the sun had just set
the crew rolled up and said it time to jet
i was kinda hesitatin' cause it was nothing to do
but we always find something to get into
total-kaos broke out he said lets go to the movies
he was paying so i wasn't being choosy
jumped in the ride and proceded to go
"yo what are we goin' to see?"
"yo man i don't know"
but when we got there it was a quarter to nine
to see the main flick it was a long as line
paid to get in and not a second before
a sucka looked me up and down at the front door
now i shined on and walked on in
but he kept on staring again and again
i walked up and said "what's up"
he said: "not you"
i turned around and then i looked at my crew
because i know he didn't say what i thought he said
and if he did
i'm gonna have his head on a platter
the sucka scared out
