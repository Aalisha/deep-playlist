[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me
