Shifting and on myself make the feel like you're
playing a game burstling sounds from all around
the DJ gonna throok our face
Watching all those clows go by fascination then
entertain singin':
Won't heart you won't heart you won't heart you back
won't heart you won't heart you won't hear you back
Neither friends or neither form moving fast that moving
slow I ain't got that time and walkin'all fellas
my heart get to your soul
...
