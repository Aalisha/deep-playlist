Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
In the land that I heard of once, once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
