A seeker of the fortune
Heir to the throne
From the horn of plenty
I taste life alone
Memories soon disappear
Through the haze becomes the twilight

Even Gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries, uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to gray
In twilight I witness higher fall
Leaving from nowhere they once belonged

Sands of time forgotten so quick
Ages pass as none regret
On their knees I see supreme
...
