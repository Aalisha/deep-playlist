when i wake up in the morning
i feel down
i go to sleep without a sound
though i know you don't feel a thing for me
i guess what i'm tryin to say is i want you to see

that my love runs deeper, deeper than bones
and i'm the keeper of my soul
and if you don't want, i won't give
'cause love has two sides
only way to live

when i look you in the eyes
do you feel safe?
and if i say to be there
will you wait?
it's a broken heart that you're pulling apart
...
