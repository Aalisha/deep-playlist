I turn on my radio
And all the music sounds hollow
The first song they're playin' sucks
And the next one swallows

The singer is whinin'
And the drummer sounds bored
The guitar player's tone
Is like a Commodore 64

Don't settle for less
Don't suffer the fools, no
Don't give them your allowance money
Let's shout, 'Led Zeppelin rules,' yeah

I turn on my TV set
And I see the 'American Idol' show
And people are wonderin'
Why all the kids are suicidal

Well, Jessica and Britney and Paris and Ashley
Well, they look so pretty
