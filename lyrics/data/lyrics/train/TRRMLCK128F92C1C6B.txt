How long Lord, my trials are takin'?
How long Lord, them files are fakin'?
Holy Lord, let me ask you an answer
Holy Lord, would you fancy a dancer?

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Holy Lord, it's fine like I told you
