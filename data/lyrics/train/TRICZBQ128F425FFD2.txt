Now, I can really see the light
After years of being blind
Self-destruction in my mind
Oh you, I want you on my side
After days of loneliness
After years of emptiness
I would never ever see the light like now
I lived for years without knowing (without knowing)
What is illusion, what is real (what is real)
All around smiling people, empty talkings
Many friends, but only when there is no need, oh no...
