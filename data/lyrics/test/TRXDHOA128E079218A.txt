Another lonely night in Amersterdam
And stars are coming out in waves
I miss my Miss America in Park Hotel
But I'm too stoned to call it a day

And when everything you wanted
Is to hide behind your eyes
And I'm locked in my hotel room
Turning over our goodbyes

I will write this down for you
So you can read it
I will hold my breath for you
Till I can't feel it

Another lonely night in Amsterdam
...
