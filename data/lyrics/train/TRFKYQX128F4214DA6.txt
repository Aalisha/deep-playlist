Hi baby, I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand, you have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much, I think about you, I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much, that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you

I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha?

You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soul mate

Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it! Yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hit the Man hit it; damn bitches

Man, this is what I'm talkin' about
Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched)
