Oh yeah, I’ve got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don’t come home at night
But when yo do you always start a fight

But I can’t be alone, I need you to come on home
I know you’re messing around
But who the hell is, is gonna hold me down

I gotta be out my mind
To think it’s gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes

And it kills me to know
How much I really love you
So much I wanna ooh, ooh, ooh
To you, ooh, ooh
