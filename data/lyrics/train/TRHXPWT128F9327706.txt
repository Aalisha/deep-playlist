Dizzy found me last night
I saw some kind of new light
I woke up in a whirlwind
Baby, just you watch my head spin
The spectacle that made you cry
It's a thrill a minute plane ride
It's over time at ring side, no lie

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me baby on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Oh, make it blow away

I hide, I seek, I go to I find
Truth in a fable faith in a rhyme
So why they want to bad talk to me
Are they surprised by what we see?
Like my table and my tide turn
Like on my bed the emperor worn
Is that enough for me? It could be
