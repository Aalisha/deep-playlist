Sad today
Sad today
Even coffee can't make it go away
I murdered my friends
But I made amends
And that is why I'm free today
Sad today
Sad to say
Mornings, evenings, I often get this way
I stole your hat
And I hanged your cat
But that should not be taken the wrong way
So come to play
On my sad today
