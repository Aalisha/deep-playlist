[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
Y'all get too close, I'ma squeeze the life out of you
You speak too loosely with your words, I'ma silence you
You ain't a leader, dog, nobody'd die for you
You ain't a killer, dog, who the fuck lied to you
And I don't even fuck with y'all ballerinas
Tryin' to tiptoe by me, I'ma stab your team up
Tryin' to get dough by me, I'ma snatch your cream up
'Cause my squad gotta eat and y'all can't come between us
Thoughts of blowin' my fuckin' head off when I look in my gun
I cock back, can't squeeze when I look at my son
I stop that, can't breathe, y'all wouldn't walk in my shoes
I'm antisocial, don't speak unless I talk with a tool

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
You can take the braggin', the boastin', add up the passion devotion
The crabs that lack in emotion, we throw 'em back in the ocean
The Pharaohs packin' the potion, we back in action and rappers are chokin'
Actin' like the smokin' cats, their backs will get broken
And '96 was the year I started talkin' with Vinnie
Rockin' the city, talkin', really reppin' Boston and Philly
