I've never been very lucky with girls
But then I'd never met Sharon
Now I have, I'm in love
'Cause we've been going out for two months
I see her on Wednesday and Saturday
And on Sunday afternoon
On Wednesday Sharon goes babysitting
For her mum's friend Mrs Higgins
I go with her to watch telly
The kids are horrible and the house is dead smelly
But it's all worth it 'cause when they've gone to bed
We start snogging on the sofa
(chorus)
Yeah, yeah, I love Sharon
Yeah, yeah, she loves me
Yeah, yeah, we love each other
