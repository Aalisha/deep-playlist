Wake up, grab your bags
California's burning to the ground
Wake up and grab your things
You and I are leaving Los Angeles

They'll try to hold you down, they'll try to pull me down
I haven't seen your face in years
Alone and walking down, the ashes cover ground
Along La Cienaga

This time we're gonna say those words
And cut the ropes that are wrapped around our necks
This time we're gonna take control and start over
We're leaving Los Angeles

Wake up and grab your bags
