Yesterday night started with a smile
Of the girl, that's sleeping right by my side.
I wanted I needed to make her mine
For such a long time

It seemed so amazing and great to me
But suddenly, somehow all of my dreams
Where fading and drifting so slowly away.
I guess those feelings were all

Wrong and on and on and on and on.
I've been wating for so long,
Waiting for this night to come
But now i'd better be moving
On and on and on and on
And on
Because this time everything went wrong.

I thought, she was the one.
Can anyone, anyhow be so wrong?
