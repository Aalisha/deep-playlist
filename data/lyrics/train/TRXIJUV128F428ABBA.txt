I can't explain it
Kinda get this feeln' like wow yeah baby
Been tryin' to say it
But I just don't quite know how uum
Oh but now
I'm hangin' on
Strong to the hope that I
See in your eyes

EVERY TIME YOU LOOK MY WAY
I CAN FEEL YOUR HEART BEAT
AND IT FEELS LIKE A BRAND NEW DAY
SO PLEASE SAY
THAT LOVE WILL BE WAITING
