Oh well I know where your going
I see where you been
don't you know by now you gotta take life on the chin
still you sit there wonderin
why the past is gone
baby you'll go under if you don't carry on
don't misunderstand me
I realize it aint easy to take
but you been hiding
and I been riding like the wind to find you
yeah
just you

I don't need no promises
just tell me the truth
mister keep it honest
