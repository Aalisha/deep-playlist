your little fish got wet
his money went to his dead
and his ass just dropped dead of exposure
oh if there's anybody anywhere
ever should have been a millionaire
just for the fact that you die out there, it's him

i should have told ya
that the things that you love start you own ya
just disagree
i shold have told ya
that the woman that you bop won't ya blow ya
she just blows me
