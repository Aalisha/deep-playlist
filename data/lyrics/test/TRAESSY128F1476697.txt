Let me check this number
488-3857

Operator, could you, could you
Ring through that number for me
It's been busy now for about two hours
Thank you very much
It's an emergency, no, I'm
I'm stuck in the phone booth down here

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Is it ringing, thank you
Hello, who's this
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Is my baby there

(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
Now look here, do me a favor, bro
When she comes, you tell her
I'm waiting for her right here
(On the corner of
Love's Street and Fool's Road)
On the corner in the phone booth

She knows where I'm at cause
The light is bright, the street signs
Are black and white
