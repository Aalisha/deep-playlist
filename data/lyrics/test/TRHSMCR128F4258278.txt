So the walls are closing in to sufficate you
Like you're trapped and flailing blindly in a garbage bag
You're sinking in a tar pit like a saber tooth...
You struggle but the blackness sticks to you
Like a disease that you can't wash off
So you go into the kichen for acarving knife
But you've tried to cut it out before
It only left you hurting more
