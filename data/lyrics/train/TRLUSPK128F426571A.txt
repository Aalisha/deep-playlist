I saw this guy 6"3, talking on his celly
Looking at me, I like his vibe
His bedroom eyes, oh yeah
Across the room the way he moved
Looking all hot in them Timberland boots
I like the things, the things he do, oh yeah

You know it's not for dancing tonight if you want to take a chance
And the single ladies need some attention
I wanna see the fellas make a move
Throw it up, give it up, don't stop

 (Put 'em up)
If you got money in the bank
In your own credit cards and a drop to see
 (Let me see you put 'em up)
If you got a clip on your cash
When you go to the club and you get in for free
 (Let me see you put 'em up, put 'em up for me)
If you like a lady with class and a dependable man
And you know how to treat
 (Let me see you put 'em up)
Then maybe we can go away ride in my escalade
I'm talking Saturday

Hey sexy boy, come with me
Daddy, I got the things you need
What's you favorite food caremel cream
Then you need to take, take a piece of me
Give me all your information, technology, with communications
And I really like the way you function

And now it's time for dancing tonight if you want to take a chance
And my single ladies need some attention
I wanna see the fellas make a move
Throw it up, give it up, don't stop
