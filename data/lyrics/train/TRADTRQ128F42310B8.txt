1. Beginning Of Sorrow

The beginning of sorrow has come.
You cannot build but can destroy with what is left on earth.
Damage, now permanent, is yet enhanced day by day by unstoppable greed.
You are never truly happy unless one suffers more than yourself.
The choice is none, you will live in a world where you must fight a battle.
Some weaker, some stronger, in termination we'll die as one.
We fight amongst ourselves, enhanced by racial difference.
Our hatred never to diminish, it's just growing and growing 'till
out day of release.
