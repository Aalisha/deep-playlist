I know I suck already
You don't even have to tell me
I'm guilty
I feel guilty all the time

I did everything you thought
I only stopped cause I got caught
And I'm guilty
I feel guilty all the time

She's leavin' today
There's no other way
No need for me to say what was on my mind
Everything I've done has been a waste of our time
I'm just guilty
I'm guilty

Your going to leave me when you hear this song
