I knew I had what I wanted
But still I wanted more
A drink or two got me started
And now I just can't get over you
The grass's so green on the other side
At least it felt so at the time
All I got was a troubled mind
And now I just can't get over you

So it comes a bitter end
Guess I blew it once again
Still I haven't learned my lesson well
I can't get over you
Could you spit me in the face
Could I starve a houndred days
Whatever it takes to break this spell
I can't get over you
