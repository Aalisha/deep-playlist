I ain't supposed to want to do a lot of drinking
'Least that's what a lot of folks keep thinking
I ain't supposed to stay out till all hours of the morning
I'm supposed to be a young lady

But I like my music loud
And a real big crowd
With a cooler close by
I like a pint of Crown
And a country sound
And staying out all night
And I like dirt roads and river banks
And something cold to drink
Yeah, some say that ain't what my life's about
And one day I'm gonna have to settle down
But not right now
...
