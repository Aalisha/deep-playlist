I have to say, I never liked you much anyway
I never cared for the things you'd say
You talk a lot of s**t my friend
And I hate to think, that all we had was tied up in drink
We never thought that one day we'll say that
I know it's the end
Cause if I feel I'm falling way to fast
Its just another day and now its just our last
As I look back now, tears in my eyes
