Raging out of control, world on fire
Red hot fire burning, lord, lord

Some hoping and praying for things to get better
But Rasta know it a go get worse, so much worse
Signs of the times are getting clearer, lord, lord
And HIS MAJESTY is getting nearer, clearer everyday

Things a go crucial
Down in a Babylon yeah
Things a go brutal now, dog a go nyam dog
Things a go brutal down in a Babylon yeah
Things a go crucial, now, now, now, lord, lord

Crucial, crucial yeah, rop pap, papa nah
Crucial, crucial, yeah, oh nan nah, nah, nah

Weeping and wailing and more tribulation
Threats and more fears and rumors of wars, lord, lord
