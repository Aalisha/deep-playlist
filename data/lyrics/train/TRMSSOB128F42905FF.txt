Boy I think you've come home
Open up the door and step inside
So many people who feel the way you do
Their sweetest dreams have always been denied
Lock the past into a box and throw away the key
And leave behind those days of endless night
Everyone is waiting
Everyone is here
Step out of the woods into the light

Everybody loves you here (x4)

Boy you've been on the wrong road
