Yeah... Eh! Yeeea. Things ain't cool anymore 4x We can't be fool no more 2x Things ain't cool anymore 4x We can't be fool no more 2x
Why's there this fussin and fighting. I think its too much material delighting. When will we come to realize its not real. Some them brothers lose their identity. And the sisters living for vanity. When will we come to the light and see.
