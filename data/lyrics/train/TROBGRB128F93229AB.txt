This form of jealousy is growing childish.
It's annoying and I'm getting tired of it.
You forgot the way to be yourself
and now your telling me I'm trying to be someone else.

So what if we lost our style.
We're trying to make it worth our while.
We're not doing this to prove anything
watch the ice on my necklace bling.

We're in it for the money,
all the groupie honeys.
We want your life so we sold out.
We wanted to be famous with what god gave us.
We sold our souls to the devil last night
and wrote this song (wrote this song).
We sold out (we sold out).
