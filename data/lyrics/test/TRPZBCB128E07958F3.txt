She stops for coffee every morning
Grabs the paper while she's yawning
Wishing she was still in bed
And though her cup is always full
The 8am express is leaving her without
A choice to stay
But where does she go
And who really knows the girl deep inside
The one she always tries to hide
Julie, Julie don't you know
You're riding on a carousel
That's going no where round and round
And round when will it end
...
