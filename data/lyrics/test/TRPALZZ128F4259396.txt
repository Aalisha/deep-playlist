So here I am, conjuring the ghost of Cain
I was born into this world,
one foot in the grave
but you can still see the grin on my face

Soon I will come and go,
out of order, raving through the show
Trembling hands, smell of death
I disregard bone and flesh

No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try
...
