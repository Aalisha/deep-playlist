I pay the price for cheap advice

Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away
So now I'm gonna take that all that I can get
With those angel eyes
You make saints do sins all the time

Say I'm gonna stay, home and away, well well,
When I said I'd catch you when you're falling
I'd have my heart open wide
And you who's not naive I thought
Say I thought I'd mend my heart

People say I'm so automatic
People say I'm not so systematic
When I'm down I'm in manual, lord
And time on time again I walk on by
With the look of love
