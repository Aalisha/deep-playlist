Out of the street, you better get on home
Tail shakin' filly runnin' on her own
They say she got loose on the night
She was born, cranking it up in a school zone

"Kick it out, come on kick it out", she said
"Kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive, kick it out"

Sittin' in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love gettin' high, gettin' down
Well, sailors see her running along the beach
