Get out of my town, get out of the spot light
You saw my heart so what does it look like?
It's not what you do but how it gets done
And now I've had my fun

I took you out into the world
I tore you down and I burnt you badly
I scream and shout, I'm lost for words
I don't know

I took my gun, shot you down
Left an exit wound you're afraid to show me
I scream and shout, I'm lost for words
I don't know

I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't tear your heart out
...
