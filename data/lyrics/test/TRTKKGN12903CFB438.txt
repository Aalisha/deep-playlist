When you turn away and lock all your doors
When it's getting out of hand, how am I to understand
And then you may think there's no turning back
Running low on self esteem
falling back into your dream

There's this endless hole in the wishing well
Wish you were somebody else
but too afraid to ask for help
Would you play a part in the scheme of things
And I will depend on you, if you show me how to do

We are the troopers, pick up the losers
