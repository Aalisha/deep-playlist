Baby, I can see the blue moon in your eyes
And when you cry, stars fall from the sky
Darlin', take up all my misery
My heart reflects the love as I fall apart

I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

Baby, I will let you think I'm missing her
I will tell no lie what I did wrong
Darlin', can't you see the blue moon in my eyee
My heart reflects the love, the stars in the sky
