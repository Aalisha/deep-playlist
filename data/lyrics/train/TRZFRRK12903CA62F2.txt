Now that your caught
It looks like youve used that line too many times before
And now it's worn out

It's all just a game to you
It's just a show for all the ladies
To see you're a wolf
Wolf dressed in sheepskin

Nice impression now tell us who you are
(Soon they'll see what I see
Soon they'll know you're lying)
Nice impression now tell us who you are
(Soon they'll see what I see
Soon they'll know you're lying)
