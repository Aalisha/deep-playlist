Ding dong, ding dong, ding

I call you ding-a-ling, ya, ya
Your my ding-a-ling
'Cause you've got everything
Every single thing
It takes to make us swing
Ah, ding-a-ling
When your near I hear bells that ring
I get a charge every time I'm in your arms
You're my ding-a-ling

Yes, I hear bells when you hold me tight
Bells, when we kiss goodnight
Bells, don't you hear 'em to
Beause I'm in love with you
Let's swell it now
Bells, mean a honeymoon
...
