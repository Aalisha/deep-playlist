I don't care what songs you sing
Or how you think of all those pointless things
Sweet nothings what you bring
So fly away on sugar coated wings

I'm sinking deep, I'm going under
That sugar coated
Iceberg tastes so sweet until you tumble
Those sugar coated lies

All those tricky things you said
On angel wings, they're flying round my head
You were cheap but I was sold
...
