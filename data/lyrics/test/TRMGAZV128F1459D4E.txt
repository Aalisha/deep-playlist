I know you think that I'm just a stranger
Just a drinker he's seen downtown
Someone he'd wave to on his way to meet you
But I know him too

Better than a "how you been?" oh better than I wish I did
When you dance where I can see

I know you think you know him better
Wait a little longer, I know him too
