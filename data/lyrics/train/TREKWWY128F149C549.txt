(Mac McAnally)
(Track 5 - Time 4: 32)

Grease in our hair
Hands in our pockets
We stood and stared
At cars goin' past
We placed our bets
Where they were headed
And held our cigarettes
Like movie stars

Grandmother's hands
Hard from the garden
She had a plan
For me to preach one day
She prayed for rain
She watched and she waited
And never complained
When it did not fall
