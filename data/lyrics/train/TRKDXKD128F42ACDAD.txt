I'm gonna swim the mountains, I'm gonna climb the sea
I'm gonna surf the fields in front of me
I'm gonna pass the buildings, that silver cage
Pass the smiling faces with the hidden rage

Till I find you, feel you, breathe you
Touch you, taste your truth
And I never gonna stop till I get to you

Gonna change in a new direction
Make a move with a new intention
You're my one and only temptation
I, till I get to you

Gonna change in a new direction
Make a move with a new intention
You're my one and only temptation
