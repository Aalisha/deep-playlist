Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain fallin'
Seems I hear your voice a callin', it's all right

Rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
Oh, it is rainin' all over the world

Neon signs flashin'
Taxicabs and buses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
...
