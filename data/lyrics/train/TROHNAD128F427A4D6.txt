(Terri Clark/Georgia Middleman/Pat Bunch)

I've had love and love's had me
I've been held and been set free
And I have lived enough to know
That you might stay or you might go
So here I am one more time
Call me brave call me blind

I'm gonna count to 3
I'm gonna hold my breath
Try not to be afraid
Tho it scares me half to death
I'm out here on a limb
Altho I know that it might break
My heart is gonna want you anyway
