You know my baby told me not so very long ago
He said, "I don't love you, baby
And you got to, you got to let me go"
And that was too much, too much for me
That's why I walked the backstreets and cry

You know it hurts me so bad
To hear my baby say
Hear my baby say goodbye

He said another reason that makes me wanna leave
You ain't got enough of nothin' to keep me, keep me [unverified]
That was too much, oh, too much for me
That's why I walked the backstreets, the backstreet and cry
Oh yeah

Oh, it hurts me, it hurts me so bad
Oh, to hear my baby
