I set my words on the ground and I was grinding my teeth. I planted
pieces of light to see if planets could speak. It took my mind by surprise

a star out of me. It's like my life was a list and my head was first
to get crossed off. It's the pleasure that I keep to sit down with my
friends and talk about my day. Can you hear me? Well I don't even care.
