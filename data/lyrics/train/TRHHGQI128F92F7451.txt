We could pretend that we're walking on petals and light
Golden light
Flaunting our love like a dance step mastered
Turning from left to right
But after all the colored lights are gone
Time will leave the ashes and the dawn
You rise and meet the day

I'm watching you go, it's like spying on hope
Ever onward with more to burn
Giving your hands and your heart
To the weave of the world, though it fights each turn
...
