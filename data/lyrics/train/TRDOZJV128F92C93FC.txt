I've got this dream that won't go away
When I close my eyes you're there, night or day
Baby, whatever it takes, I've gotta find you

Are you someone I know or that I'll meet by chance?
Are you somewhere close or in a far away land?
Across the ocean or burnin' sand, I've gotta find you

I've gotta find you, don't care how long it takes
I know when I do it'll be worth the wait
With God as my witness and love as my guiding star
