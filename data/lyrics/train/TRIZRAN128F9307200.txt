How do I know you won? t hurt me?
What makes me so different?

I spent my whole life just wonderin' around
Lost in love until I was found by
You
And I thank you, you showed me
What
Life is all about
You've turned my whole life around
Changed all that I do, it's all because of you

 (You)
I threw away my players card
 (You)
I put my girl before my card
 (You)
I believe that I can reach the stars
 (It? s all because of you)
'Cause I knew you're there

 (You)
I swear I'll never fool around
 (You)
Won't hang out all night trying to clown
 (You)
Right now I wanna settle down
 (It? s all because of you)
Baby, baby

Lovin' you is such a beautiful thing
Got me thinkin' 'bout coppin' you that ring
Your such a queen and you
You've given my life new meaning, it's like a dream
How could this be, someone like you for me?
I've never felt more complete than I do when I'm with you

 (You)
