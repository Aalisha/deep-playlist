Should I listen what you say
Or listen what your folks say?
It's a tough decision to make
I don't really wanna lose you
But I don't want your folks to
Turn me over to the hands of the law

I guess they think that
I'm not good enough for you
I can tell the way they act and their attitudes
(As the tears roll from my eyes)
As the tears roll from my eyes
I feel the hurt inside
(As I reach, reach out to you)
As I reach out to you saying I'm so confused

Oh, oh I'm trapped
Like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out

You see I'm trapped
Like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out

If you love one another
Why should you let this go further?
Can't you see it's gonna pull us apart
If you think I can't afford to
Support you if you want to
Ever think about ever settlin' down?

I guess they think that
I'm not good enough for you
I can tell the way they act and their attitudes
(As the tears roll from my eyes)
As the tears roll from my eyes
