I still miss you, I still care, sometimes I swear you're still here.
Do you miss me?
Do you care?
Does it hurt that I'm not there?

Told me you need something better.
What is better than love?
Told me you need something new.
But all I need is you to feel the way you make me feel.

I never meant to hurt you, never meant to say those things,
never meant to write them down in a song about the way it used to be.
It used to be so good.
You used to be my everything.

I just want you to know that I'm just fine on my own.
