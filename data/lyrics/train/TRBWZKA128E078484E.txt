Well you got that girl and she lives with you
And she does just want you want her to
And when I call you on the phone, she says you're not there
But I know you're home-

You better tell that girl to shut up
You better tell that girl I'm gonna beat her up
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl
You better tell that girl

Well we used to be the best of friends
Now all that's gonna have to end
But there's just one thing that I can't see
How she's got got you hanging up on me

You better tell that girl to shut up
...
