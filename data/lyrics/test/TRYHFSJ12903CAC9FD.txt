We arrived by the hundreds, a gang of the dead
Donning our weapons and cycles of steel
Deformed and demented and living in filth
Riding through cities lusting for death... yeah

Moonlight brightens the dark city streets
We are the hunted, so fire at will
Surviving by chance, alive just by luck
We gotta move to see another day

Violence, destruction and hate
Where gangs are ruling the waste
You've entered the city of graves
...
