Alarm clock rings, i crawl out of bed. i'm not looking forward to what lies ahead. all day i'm like a zombie, the working dead. today's gonna be a boring day.
I know it. i'm not interested in what i'm doing.
I show it. i wish that i could walk away. you know? we're all the same.
Would happiness be worth the wait? would all the mondays be worth the pain?
Some say they'll see.
