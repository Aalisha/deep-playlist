Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
I say come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang, oh yeah?
Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang?
Do you wanna be in my gang?
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
Well, there's no one like the man I am
I can take you high as a kite every single night
I can make you jump out of bed standing on my head
Who'd ever believe it? Come on, come on
