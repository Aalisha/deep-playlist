All dressed down to catch a whiff of the buzz
Smells like the death of the last great cause
But you & I we've been through that and that is not our fate
Give my face to the back of your head
Loyal in your shadow
Yeah yeah yeah
Broken accidental stars

Do lawyers have lawyers?
Do landlords have landlords? we're wondering
One more cheap suit in the loop, more chlorine in the pool
The blonde dolls smiling behind us
...
