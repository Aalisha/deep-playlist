Time to spit new shit
I'm rocking on this new bit
I'm hot now you'll see
I'll fight you just to get peace
Heavy Weight Wrestler
Fight me in your comforter
Let you be superior
I'm flithy with the fury ya

I'll hard drive your bit
I'm battered by your sumo grip
Lucky I like feeling shit
My Stamina can take it
Gymnastics, Super Fit
