Valor they instill to face certain death in conflict
Win the war through discipline, trained to follow orders
Dilettantes of war, torn apart

Send them all to be slaughtered, standard training set
In a dark, distant, foreign shithole, wretched torment
Approaching the vile sphere of contention, breathing the smoke, the dust
Blood-soaked earth, stained red oceans, four your insides

Sudden hail, gunfire, half the men drop dead
Troops lost in transport, waste of lives

Terrified grunts die confused
Send them all to be slaughtered
Insufficient base munitions
Compelled by force to fight until death

Certain causualty, amateurs who all die before they learn to fight
