He's gonna chalk you out
In his angelhood
He's got the love, let- let us
Like he said he would, like he said he would

He's gonna chalk you out
In his angelhood
Please stand alone and let us
Like he said he would, like he said he would

Like he said he would
Like he said he would
Like he said he would
Like he said he would
Like he said he would
