In my young life I have received
Callers as though they were Christmas Eve
Disappointed and I don't know why?
She gave me laughter and hope
And a sock in the eye
(A love like this is sealed with a kiss)
In my young life and I know something now
I've never tried to create a wow
Wows are few frustration more common
Now I can feel it in my soul
That's why I gave the come on
Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
Kiss me with your mouth
