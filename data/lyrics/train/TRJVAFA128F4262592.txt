conversations haunt me like the body that wouldnt sink
if i could id take back some things i have said
i put alot on you it was good for sympathy
but the truth is that i was that bad

so when i say nothing
when i do nothing
the thing i sit with come flying out

try responsabilty and not, not pasafisim
