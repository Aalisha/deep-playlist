It's a hot night at the juke joint
And the bands pumpin' rhythm and blues
Gonna spill a little rock and roll blood tonight
Gonna make some front page news
And the ladies hate the violence
Still they never seem to look away

'Cause they love those
Wild-eyed Southern boys
Wild-eyed boys
Wild-eyed Southern boys

It's a Southern point of honor
You got a get right in on the action
You can hear the outlaws holler
Fight for the lady in black
And she's just one in a million
