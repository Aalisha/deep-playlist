Who holds the money, who holds the need
Who holds the strings of misery or the purse of greed
And the gunmen reap while the gangsters sow
And law is cheap when the smugglers go

(Give us peace) Give us peace in our time
(Give us peace) Give us peace in our time
While I have a life to live
Then I have no life to give
(Give us peace) Give us peace in our time

In sun-kissed rooms in city slums
Minds are restless till the airmail comes
From the forest floor to the western mind
...
