I see a red door and I want to paint it black.
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black.
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,
With flowers and my love both never to come back.
Maybe I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world's turnin' black.
