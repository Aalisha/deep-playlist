Somethin's tellin me I better saddle up
News is blowin' in, it just ain't lettin' up
Storm clouds are bringin' in the call of the wild
Disaster's wakin' up, she's only but a child

I can't deny it
I'll be gone before tomorrow
Stop your cryin'
We'll all be gone before too long

Oh yeah

All hell's breakin' loose in all directions
Can't stick around, posse's close behind
Bad boys are comin' back with scores to settle
Cats In Boots, these boys are back in town, yeah

Well if I'm caught I'll surely stand trial
That judge be grinnin', sportin' that evil smile
So I'm gonna ride on, bide on my time
I just wanna rock'n'roll away yay yeah

I can't deny it
...
