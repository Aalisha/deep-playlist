Say, man
Looky here, man
Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek
What say, let's get together
And play some hide and go seek
Let's go, let's play

Well, I love you
Love you, love you
Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me
You all hid (yeah)

If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)

Are you ready (I'm not ready)
Aw, man, let's hide this time

I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
Who all hid (yeah)

If you ain't hid
You better holler
Billy goat (baaaa)

Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
Already hid, you better
...
