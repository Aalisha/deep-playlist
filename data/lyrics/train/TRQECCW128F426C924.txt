See what I believe in

I believe that Bring It All To Me
Needs a remix
A remix, yeah uh huh
Hey, woo, like this kick it Mari

Shamari, Verse 1:
I been tryin to figure you out
for the longest, time
Everybody claims they dont know your name
You appear to be someone Ive danced with, before
And now I shall amass to reveal your game
And I want you to come on

woo woo
The way youre faded in the night
woo woo

All you gotta do is say
Baby, bring it all to me
And I want you to come

Dance wit me, come and dance wit me
dont mess wit me (baby, oh, yeah)

Dance wit me, come and dance wit me

Shamari, Verse 2:
Your shadows blockin my view
please move over right now
Dont give me away 'cause I still wanna know his name

I dont care how long it take just to know him

I just want to dance the night away
And I want you to come

woo woo

woo woo
I know how to make your body rock
woo woo
All you gotta do is say
Baby bring it all to me
And I want you to come

Dance wit me, come and dance wit me
