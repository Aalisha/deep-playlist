Stop be quiet now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes

Fly
Out with the light

There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But one day it all will come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark,
Leave your mark in the land of mine

The second one to the right
And then straight on until morning light
Stop be quiet now
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
