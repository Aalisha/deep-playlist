there goes my love, there goes her heart
and that's not the last of it, or the worst part
there goes my eves, down my downspout
there goes my car, and my house
cuz i'm out of here
cuz i'm out
i'm not through sleeping
i'm not through sleeping around
i'm not through sleeping
i'm not through sleeping around
there goes the pop, there goes my ears
and i've been around so long, just not here
there goes the wings, of my grey dove
...
