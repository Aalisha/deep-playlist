Can you meet me in the country
In the summertime in England?
Will you meet me?

Will you meet me in the country
In the summertime in England?
Will you meet me?

We'll go riding up to Kendal in the country
In the summertime in England

Did you ever hear about
Did you ever hear about
Did you ever hear about
Wordsworth and Coleridge, baby?
Did you ever hear about
Wordsworth and Coleridge?

They were smokin' up in Kendal
By the lakeside

Can you meet me in the country in the long grass
In the summertime in England?
Will you meet me?

With your red robe dangling all around your body
With your red robe dangling all around your body
Will you meet me?

Did you ever hear about
William Blake
T. S. Eliot?

In the summer, in the countryside
They were smokin'
Summertime in England

Won't you meet me down Bristol
Meet me along by Bristol
We'll go ridin' down

Down by Avalon
Down by Avalon
Down by Avalon
In the countryside in England

With your red robe danglin' all around your body free
Let your red robe go

Goin' ridin' down by Avalon
Would you meet me in the country
In the summertime in England

Would you meet me?
In the Church of St. John
Down by Avalon
