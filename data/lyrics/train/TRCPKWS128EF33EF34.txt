I put my arms around you, your body stalls and droops
I give you consolation but there's nothing I can do
Estranged I listen to a voice so scared
Like a martyr from another world, I no longer share

The anguish of a thousand days, the fear of life like everyone
Against there is no chance to swim, you have to simply drift along

Everyday the sting moves deeper, one day it will reach your soul
...
