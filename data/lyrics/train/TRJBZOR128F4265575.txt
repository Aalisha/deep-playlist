Everybody's got a number tattooed on their soul
And the time's gonna come boy, when your number's called
Everybody gets a uniform and a hut to live in
They give you your rank, you tell 'em your next of kin

And there's no escape for the likes of you, my friend

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna be out on an island
