And there you were beside me
in the middle of a crowd
It took so long to find me
while I cried to you out loud
It seemed like forever
I was so alone
I thought I've never find home


I was stumbling in the darkness
I was living underground
Now I'm standing in the sunlight
basking in this love I've found


It's the first breath of a baby
it's the warmth of a touch
I'm giving you my vow
I'll say it here and now
Nothing I could do
could mean as much


I savor every moment
I hang on every word
It's rapture just to touch you
the world becomes a blur
