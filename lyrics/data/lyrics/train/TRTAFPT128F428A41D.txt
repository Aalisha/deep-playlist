I must have stood for hours 
The mist of dawn still rising 
Brushing from my face 
Cold tears of finally knowing 
The world that we had twisted 
The years of strength and glory 
Were wicked and obscene 
And there we stood so proud 
What legends we must be 
Really something to behold Lord 
So irresponsible 
With the powers of creation 
A princess crowned in jewels 
Robed in the finest cloth 
Dauntlessly invincible 
So perfect so unreal 

In one great moment judgements fallen 
Babylon no longer there 
Gone are her streets her giant towers 
Disappeared into thin air 
Don't ever cry just remember
