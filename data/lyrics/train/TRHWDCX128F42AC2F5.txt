You're a well paid scientist
You only talk in facts
You know you're always right
'Cause you know how to prove it

Step by step
A PhD to show you're smart
With textbook formulas
But you're used up
Just like a factory hand

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid
You're well trained
You're tied to a rack

Company cocktails - gotta go
Say the right thing
