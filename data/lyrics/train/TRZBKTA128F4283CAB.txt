Yeah, where you going? Turn around
What you're looking for has been found
Baby I'm right here, excuse me if I seem a bit blunt
But I know what I want and it's you

Look into my eyes, oh girl
See you're breaking me down
I just wanna ride you girl
No better time then now

Baby I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Yeah, yeah, baby I don't wanna
I just wanna use your love tonight
I need you tonight

Oh, I don't wanna lose your love tonight
