Go ahead and light up your cigarette
Best get drunk and belligerent
Maybe then I'll consider it
Once I'm stripped of my innocence
From the duo of parking lot
To riverside where the water stops
Yo we're gonna lose all we've got
And never resolve this all with pot

It's nothing like before
There's no signs of hope here
I'm letting myself go
And you don't care
