Six foot six he stood on the ground
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck

But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
