Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys we don't like it
So we're getting up and going down

Hiding low looking right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
