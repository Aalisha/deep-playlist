One day, when the fires eat the lands
And the widows start to dance
Then it shows all the beauty
In just one day

Why is it ever too late and why, is it ever
Why is it ever too late and why, is it ever
Too late

See the beauty of the world
For a second just a glance
One day when the fire roses dance

One day when I am crying for this song
Now it's written to the end
...
