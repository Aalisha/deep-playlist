Background: Just ask the lonely

Levi Stubbs:
When you feel that need
To make it all alone,
Remember no one is thinking of,
Going alone

Just ask the lonely...
They know the hurt and pain,
Of losing a love, you can never regain

Background: Just ask the lonely
Levi: Just ask the lonely

Levi: The young and foolish laugh at love
Four Tops: Woo-hoo
Levi: So they run away...
