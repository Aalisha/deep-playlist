I've got a friend who wears go-go boots to Sunday School
We used to sit and drink pink champagne on a tin roof
Ridin' it out in a thunder bird
Singin' out loud every single word of Jack and Diane

Tryin' to pretend there was no rules
Kissin' on boys and sneakin' in bars
Tryin' to get a glimpse of who we are
We weren't wild, but we weren't far

She said, "Thelma and Louise, you got nothin' on me "
And you can tell ol' James Dean to get in line
Thanks to Elvis and Kurt Cobain, the world will never be the same
