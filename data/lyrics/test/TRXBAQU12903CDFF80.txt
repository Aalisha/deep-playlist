I think the Bruster's Rooster's are fantastic

You've got the black stripe
Dripping down the back of your head
Another bulls-eye
Try to run, but I'm already bent

You want to talk smack, yeah
You're as weak as it gets
I promise you, man
I am the one who will never forget

The desert home is all he knows
As dead as you are
The desert home is all he knows
I'll never move on

The desert home is all he knows
