Do what you gotta do
Anything is possible
Anything is possible

Verse 1
Aint nothing like the feeling of
Flying so high that you can go
In the blink of an eye, like superman
Got your crew saying bro that you the man
Put in work, beyond the average
Paid dues, got grades just the way it is
Balancing act mind, body and soul
Love to logic, like vocal to the flow
But nobody's knows
What you see
Cause what it aint, aint what it is
Common sense is what it is to me
Anything is possible

Chorus
Do what you gotta do
Go to, where you gotta to go
So meet who you gotta meet
And know what you gotta know
...
