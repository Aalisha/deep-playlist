Just yesterday when I was faced
Get up and on or be misplaced
Tomorrow or until my end
Come make or break - I tend to bend

Hey! Hey! Last night I think when I was forced
To reevaluate everything that I've endorsed
Then separate what's left from right
I think that all went down last night

Finally Finally! Finally I was forced to face
Another first for me
Finally I was forced to face
And for the first time finally, I can see
Finally I can see so clear and
For a moment don't mind me
