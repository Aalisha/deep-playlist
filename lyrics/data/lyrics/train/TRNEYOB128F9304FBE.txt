Would you jump right out of the ring side?
Would you jump right out of your eyes?
Ahhhh Ahhhh.

Would you jump right out of the ring side?
Would you jump right out of your eyes?
Ahhhh Ahhhh.

It's just a box that flickers and lip syncs
Turn it off my heads going to die
Ahh Ahhhh.

Can you feel the back of my head please?
I think the screws are rattling loose
Ahhh Ahh.

Give me that it's mine
I'll trade your useless games
Will just decay so count me in
I won't relate commission free
for information.
