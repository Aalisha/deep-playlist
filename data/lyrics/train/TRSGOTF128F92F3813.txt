Oh it's easy to find some one to play with
And almost anyone will do to fill your idle time
But that very special someone,
you can share all your dreams with is so hard to find

And it use to be like me to settle for the physical
But these days it ain't too easy to make up my mind
Cause apparently you body just to temporally to take
up my precious time

See I've got to know that
That I can be free with you and
You've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time
Can you stimulate my mind?

And I know that it looks good,
But can you be a part of my life
And I'm sure that it feels good
But can you be a part of my life
And it probably even taste good
But can you be a part of my life
I've got to know
