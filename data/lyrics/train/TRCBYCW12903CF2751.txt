Down and out
In Budapest and Los Angeles
I drank a river to forget
To forget about the coming storm
The curtains are down
The lights are off
And the doors are closed
I think about this life I've known
And I hope this time
I won't let it go

Will you catch me when I run
Will you stop me when I'm done
When the day is through
All I want to do is slow down
When I call on you
Will you help me to slow down
