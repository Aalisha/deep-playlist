Your eyes were so deep when we danced in a trance
Someone In my head beat a timbal
Lips of flattery and eyes of lust
Can't you see, can't you see
You lead me astray but I say
Carnal love is not a must
Can't you see that I beg you
Just for a hug and somme trust

I am a beggarman, you are my heaven
And I am the sun
