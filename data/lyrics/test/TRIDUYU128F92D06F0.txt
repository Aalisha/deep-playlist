The girl's well read
Of pale white skin
You cut your arms
Baby, just to fit in

You say that you like to be on your own
But it's calm right now and a long walk home
You can't go on calling human hands
But I'm here so you might as well have me, have me

Autonomy boy you're so naive
With your heart on your sleeve
And your long head of hair
I find it very rude that you didn't think I care
Autonomy boy you got me making vows
In the back of a cab on the way out of here
And I find it very rude that you didn't think I care
...
