Remember that 65 mustang that I bought in '74
I used to like to take you driving and get lost on those old dirt roads
And we'd pull off on the side and then I'd hold you tight
Let's do that tonight

Come on and kiss me in the car
Kiss me in the car, yeah

Now we can sit out in the driveway
Do it the right way from the heart
Let me take you back
And we'll find that same old star

Come on and kiss me in the car
