Rock
Come on
Turn it up
Come on
Turn it up
Come on
Rock
Turn it up
Rock
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea

Every night and every day
I know what I need to get blown away
I turn it on to overload
And let the power of the sound explode

So come on
(Come on)
Everybody let's go
Turn it up
(Turn it up)
I just gotta have some more
...
