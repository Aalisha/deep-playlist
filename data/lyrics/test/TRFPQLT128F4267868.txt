Baby, I love the way you movin', can't take my eyes off you
And everytime I see you doin', I swear you gonna shake somethin' loose

You better hold on to your hiney, that's what you better do, do, do, yeah
You better hold on to your hiney, 'fore that funky music breaks you in two

I can tell you really like to doin', and you make me wanna scream
And when you get your body into it, yeah
Ooh, you sexy thing

Hold on to your hiney, that's what you better do, do, do, do
...
