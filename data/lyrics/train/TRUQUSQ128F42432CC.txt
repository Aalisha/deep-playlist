I was once a young boy
Never fled too far from home
Now I've lost my name
And misplaced my home
I retreat back to places
Where I am someone they love
Bright lights serving justice up from above

Everybody thinks they know my name
And where I've been
I've got news for you that'll turn your head
I'm not exactly who you think that I've been all along
Shut your fuckin' mouth and sing my song

I always knew I would be the one
To make you believe
(To make you believe)
