Yeah yeah, oh oh
Here she comes again, miss blond hair sin
You don't wanna
Know where she's been
She's from a place where
All the fire goes
Only she knows how long she can go

(Chorus)
Say hello, say hello
Say hello to miss Julie
She's devastating, manipulating
No good
Say hello, say hello
Miss Julie's got it all
But she's gonna break your heart
Say hello
And walk away
