...Murder...
Billions of you parasites always asking for more...
Blindly praying for your oh so precious lord.
Well you fucked up and you can't stand the fact that you're gone...
Can't you motherfuckers see, can't you feel what the fuck is going on.

I need, you need, they need: WAR! I need, you need, they need: WAR!

Where is your God? (I can show you mine)
It's more divine. (and I feel so fine)
