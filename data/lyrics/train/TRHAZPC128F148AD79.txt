Let's take the longest way
through the hallways of your mind.
upon your knees,
the phantom breeze
of a shipwreck lost in time.
You're ending near
the kelly fear
adorns the walls in slime.
figure it out. [figure it out...]
just like you used to do.
in the essence of proud,
that's when you're cursed to prove.
And as the perfect wings'll glide,
cleansed are men of all the mice.
past the pain, we tend to stride,
or that's how it seems to beginners.
accept awards throughout our lives,
to make young lovers intertwine.
perhaps the end will come tonight,
so hooray for the winners.
A vast abyss, where lie dismissed
