I wrote a song, wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song, wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song, wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song, wanna hear it, here it go

The perfect melody is my head
I got a song that's meant for one thing
I got the candles lit I'm rocking my lapearla
Fit and pouring a glass of champagne

See I've been planning
The right time for me to tell you baby
But it's better if I show ya
Forget the radio 'cuz I already wrote

I wrote this song, this song
Specifically to make love to you
Boy all night long, night long
There ain't no hesitation on my part I wrote

This song, this song
Specifically to make love to you
Boy all night long, night long
