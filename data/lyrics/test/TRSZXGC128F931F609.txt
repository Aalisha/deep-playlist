come all you good time people
while I've got money to spend
tomorrow might be Monday 
and I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend	
well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
my good time friends are around	
but as soon as my pocketbook is empty
not a friend on this earth can be found	
i wrote my little woman a letter good people
and i told her i was in jail
she sent me back an answer
sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
but I'm still walking round 
...
