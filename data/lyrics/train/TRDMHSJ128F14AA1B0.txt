I threw a bottle in the air
And it smashed into a thousand pieces on a concrete street
Where the children play at their feet

Ran as fast as we could
'Cause I might've woke the neighborhood, yeah
I don't feel too good
No, no, no, I don't feel too good at all

'Cause when the sun comes up
And the children wake
And get on the streets and play
I'll be the one to blame

'Cause I'm a criminal, I'm, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm, I'm a criminal

It didn't last too long
I passed out, I woke up and the guilt was gone
Without a care, I went down the stairs
Into the kitchen, eat my breakfast there

Turned on the television screen
Emergency, news team
Little girl crying on the street
Saying "Glass, g-glass made my feet bleed"
...
