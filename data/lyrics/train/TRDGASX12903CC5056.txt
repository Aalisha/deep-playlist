No more - I don't see it at all
And I feel - But only as you feel
I'm focused - But don't take it to mind
I'm too weak
I need to idolize
This fixation is my frustration
Too weak to believe in me
I need a magazine to see
How pathetic I must be

Your idols fade away
Your idols fade away

Who can you run to now?
