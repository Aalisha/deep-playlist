Oh-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

In the darkness
Sitting in the corner of
Les bendouche
I' been thinking
When will I get the chance
To be alone with you

People talking to me
But i-i don't hear a word that they say-ay
Cos in my mind I am already ten thousand miles away

Where I really wanna be is
In-in our room
Oh won't you come with me
In our room-oom
I'll take you slowly
Always room-oom
For your company
I'll be good to you
When you take me to our room

Sitting here melting
Waiting for your eyes to say your melting too
You make me happy
