It woke up in me years ago
How this was meant to be
All of those falsehoods plain to see
They dug and hung their greed

Will there be profit?
You could see if only we were blind
Lonely and sheltered, your life is free
But its still one step behind

Just like me, they tried their rules on me
They tried their rules on me
They tried their rules on me, me, me
I broke those chains and fucking split

And so you, and so you, and so you, and so you
Pass all the fascist asses
Ignore those classes of bottleneck masses
...
