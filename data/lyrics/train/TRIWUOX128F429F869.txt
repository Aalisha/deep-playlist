Emotionless, I slip into the black
And there's no turning back
Now everyone around me smoking crack
This tunnel is blinding, hallucinating
I'm debating life, but it's still moving forward
If I could just change the hands of time

Well I'd do it better

Just walk away
Just walk away

Just walk away
...
