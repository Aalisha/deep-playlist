Bar room night life weekend romance used to turn me on
I was wild and winded and never gave my restless heart to anyone
One night stands would end up from a midnight rendezvous
Well I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you

I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you
'Cause I'd built a wall around my heart that no one could get through
For once I had it broke and I still feel the bruise
And I never thought that I would fall in love with you

Well passion rises in my heart each time you're in my arms
