In the whitest white house, in the house made of the dawn
In the reddest red house, the house of evening light
In the blackest black house, you purify the day,
you’re soaring through the night,
you’re soaring through the night

Storms forming as the great bird flies
Stirring her winds of the world
Watch lightning flashing from her eyes
Your fearsome form dominates the skies

{Chorus}
Thunderbird
Thunderbird
