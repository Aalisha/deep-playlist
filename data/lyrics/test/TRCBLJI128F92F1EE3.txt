You know what I want want
I know what you want want
Tell me what I want want
I'll tell you what you want want

You know what I want want
I know what you want want
Tell me what I want want
I'll tell you what you want want

So many ladies in the room (in the room)
All that I can see is you (see is you)
This dime piece is in this place (place)
But you came through and took the cake (whoooh)

Cause I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me in your world (yeah)
Yes I know what I like
And I know what I want (want)
And I know how to get it
Let me prove it to you one on one

Can I take you home girl (can I take you home girl)
Get you all alone girl (get you all alone girl)
And do you like I want to (aayyeah)
Kiss you like I want to (kiss it like I want to)
Can I take you home girl
