The stars awake over fields of gold
The plans we made were cold as stone
Paint this symbol on the door of your home
Bathed in their eyes I saw him grow

It's the cool of the evening
The sun god
Kisses little blue jeaned girls
As he is going down below

Don't fear the consequence
There won't be any trial
Resist the temptation of reason as you are flying
When everything goes down
...
