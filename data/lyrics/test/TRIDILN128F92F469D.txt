I'm an old rover tired of this world
let me follow the whirlpool of life
into the world of happiness
that lies on the other side of death.
Grant me my deepest wish
that I patiently yearn for.
To wander the vales of solitude
and to ride the sky on invisible wings.
I will keep the spying hawk company
and bleed with the dove in its claws.
I will hunt with the wolfpack
and share pain with the deer in their jaws.
