Ev'rything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true,
I'll give you just one guess,
My sweet Lorraine said "Yes;"
Waiting for the time, soon to be,
When the bells will chime merrily,

(I'm so happy,)When it's raining I don't miss the sun,
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one
...
