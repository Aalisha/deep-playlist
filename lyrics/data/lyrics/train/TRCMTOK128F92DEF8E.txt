Lorelei
Maybe you like a little melody
It's not the words that move me
Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Maybe you like a lullaby
Now I can't remember why

Lorelei Lorelei Lorelei
Intuition's leading us where
I don't know yet
Lorelei Lorelei
Something's happening
Hard to place it, hard to hide it

Lorelei Lorelei
What is happening
I'm not sure, I guess you know it
Lorelei Lorelei

Deep in the jungle of thought
...
