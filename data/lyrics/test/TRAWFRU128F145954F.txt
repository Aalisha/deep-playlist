Laughin' till it pisses everybody off
Pullin' up my dress at a dinner meeting
Kissin' till my lips are ready to fall off
Screamin' all night then just say I'm singin'
Yeah these are some of my favorite things

Gold butterflies and gum on a string
Yeah these are some of my favorite things
But doin' nothin' is my favorite one

Cashin' in on the glory of my biggest mistakes
fading in the grass basking in the sunlight
...
