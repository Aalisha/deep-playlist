Do you ever see that stuff that be
when it get cold that ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes.
Yep, black ice.

Now you know and I know I done bumped every hole in the wall y'all
did you catch that phone call most of y'all didn't met me
thought I was tall, Get flipped like a dip
slipped fell on da black ice
did you think twice, homeslice came and he went
satisfied got bent bars ain't shit
meetin' coast to coast yeah lamped & bo man do-si-dos
too many coming close cuz

Touched what I never touched before, seen what I never seen before
woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

Circulate like a Sunday paper
capers caught tony tone with cheap flicks
good picks pay hard watch the hard turn sideways
clip the tale for real sales to the who lose cash
flesh Live your life for now
feeling good and warm windows rolled tight
thirty five degrees nippy tonight, don't forget the chapstick
lips dry quick when the jack out make you wanna act out
take the slack out some people black out
