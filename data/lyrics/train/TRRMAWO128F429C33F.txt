(Ow)
One of these girls is doin' their own thing
(Oh-ohh)
One of these girls is just not the same

We think she's sweet and pretty in pink
But you better beware, cos I ain't what you think
I'm always searching for a good time, night and day
She gets down in unusual ways
Gettin' my kicks, bein' naughty and cheeky
Dream on, babe you're just freaky (Mel C & Emma)

But when we got together
We just come as a one
Doin' mmm, mmm
And a-whoa yeah

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said ah even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game
(Oh-ohh)
