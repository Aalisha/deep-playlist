1ST VERSE
I have cried all night
trying to make it better
I recognize my pain
Things are getting harder
For us, to be
In this love
And my tears wash away my smile
And I'm drowning in my sorrow
There's no hope for today
I can't see more tomorrow
'Cause we are no longer in love

CHORUS
This love
Your love, my love
...
