I'm burning slow on a pale blue flame
I'm so cold, consumed and tame
My heart is weak like a flickering light
But I won't give in
I won't lose this fight tonight

I'm here all alone beneath the black sky
I depend on you, my flame will never die
The wind cries a whisper, calling out my name
Show me the way through the blizzard
and rain

My blood flows strong now
I'm ready for the show
...
