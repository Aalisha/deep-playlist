Statistics have shown that youth violence
Is at record high today in America
Due to excessive use of drugs and alcohol
Man, how the fuck do you know?

My mind's just spinnin' off that indoor smoke
Got me seein' double visions 'cause I'm tore up loc
It's no joke the weed smoke got me crazaay
And the BJ got me pissy like a baby

I was fuckin' with these twinz gettin' crazaay endz
Robbin jewelry stores for the cash and the gems
Identical bastards on some fast shit, tried to stash it
Took the nine plastic, had they fam on some sad shit

My conscience buggin' filled wit all the bad memories
I'm visionin' dead enemies tryin' to kill me
In my sleep, same niggaz that I put to rest
Got me wakin' up pourin' down a hella sweat

The drugs got a nigga high and I can't explain
Tye and skunk playin' tricks on my fuckin' brain
Shit is strange 'cause I know deez motherfuckers dead
You see the murder still flash back in my head

Smokin' that denk, sippin' that drink
Make a nigga act kinda crazaay
Smokin' that denk, sippin' that drink
Make a nigga act kinda crazaay

Smokin' that denk, sippin' that drink
