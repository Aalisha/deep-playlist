Deeper, Rasta should be deeper
You must care about the people
Deeper, Rasta should be deeper
I'm my brothers keeper
Deeper, Rasta should be deeper
Got to wear Khaki and turban everyday
It's more than the turban, more than the robe and more
then the natty hair
It's much, much more than to say Selassie Marcus I
Me no do this fi image, me no mimic me na do this fi
