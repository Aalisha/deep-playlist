Joc, Joc don't stop, oh my God, you're so hot
Catch me on your block with 4 glocks and 4 shots
Bet you niggas know not, try me like a hoe not
Niggas run in, kick the door, fuck a door knock

Gotta make the quarter, I mix it with the soda
I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola
Hold up 'fore I have to load up, hollow tips as they explode up
Leave you pussy niggas wet as chocha stankin? with the odor

Bring your own beer to the party, alright
Bring your own beer to the party, alright
Bring your own beer to the party, motherfuckers
? Cause I heard you came to have a good time, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
 (Ah, let's go)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
 (Ah, let's go)

Alright, alright, alright, alright
 (Ah, let's go)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
 (Ah, let's go, motherfucker)

Yeah, Yung Joc so jiggy, Learjet to your city
Monday night, Magic City, thunderstorm when I'm tippin?
Ice game, Super Nifty, super kush, two for fifty
Fat boy yellin? out, pop bottles 'til I'm tipsy

I like my chick booty big-o, lay my head on them big ole's
Put her on her tiptoes, I get up in the middle
I don't wine them, dine them, or rest have 'em
