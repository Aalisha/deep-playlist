I've never seen you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through another season passes by you
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

In a big country, dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

Here we go

I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
You can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered

I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
Stay alive
