That crystal throws
Glass shadows home
When the day is long
Rain on the city
Men are weary
A silent blue
A wind blows
The summer knows
Your time with us is though
The world goes spinning round again
And the dream dust covers you

Blue butterflies danced in her eyes
When they fell upon you
Painless and pretty
...
