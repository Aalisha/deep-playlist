Oh We Thank You Lord
Oh!

Son Of Man
Son of Righteousness
King of the earth
For center slain
I was lost
In darkness bound
Randsom on my heart
And I will sing
Yea!
Come on
We worship you
Oh mighty god
Oh!
Come on and say "Son of man"
Son Of Man

Son of Righteousness
King of thee earth
For center slain
