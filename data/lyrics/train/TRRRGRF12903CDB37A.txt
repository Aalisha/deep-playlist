To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago, I was your man, was your man
Verbally, we'd agreed it was over
And we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you, girl
We can't be friends
(No, no oh, oh no no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend)
We can't be friends
('Cause I'm still in love with you, yeah)
I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you're still family and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
