fire, fire, fire...
here's a lesson you will learn
play with fire you'll get burned
fire, fire
here's a lesson you will learn
play with fire, baby, you'll get... burned

one day... you'll view a lesson... baby

you said you love me, baby you don't love no one
you just taking without kiddin', baby i have had enough
so listen clearly now, 'cause you'd better hear these words
may have thought that you had foolled me, but you're about to learn

you're a backstandin', mistreatin', low-down rockin' dirty man
you're gonna get what you deserve, i promise you
you're dyin' and cheatin', broke the wrong heart this time
i'm about to be the one who showed you and i know

fire, fire
(yeah, you're gonna, yeah, you're gonna learn)
here's a lesson you will learn (one day)
play with fire, you'll get burned
fire, fire
...
