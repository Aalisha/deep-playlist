It comes from Mississippi, and down in Alabam
Creepin' like a fever all across the land
From deep in the Delta on the Louisiana shore
The people got to have it, they wanna hear some more

It's the hillbilly rock, beat it with a drum
Playin' them guitars like shootin' from a gun
Keepin' up the rhythm, steady as a clock
Doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

Some say it came from Memphis down in Tennessee
Or it drifted in from Georgia about 1953
Just as long as it's greasy, as long as it's fast
As long as it's pumpin' honey, it's gonna last
...
