Out of all the reindeers
You know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph
Randolph ain't too far behind

Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round

Said Santa to a boy
Child what have you been longing for
All I want for Christmas is a
Rock and roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph
...
