British Intelligence, they're on your back
And they won't catch no one so they won't catch me
Three, fours and right up your back
And you just got sacked, now your money's not free

Taking time has never won enough
And three to the four when you're really wired
Too much is never enough, now you're fired

This is for the cold concrete sold by the feet
Taxed by a man that I'm yet to meet
Pay an army, I'm hardly ready to speak
Memories start in 93

And [Incomprehensible] came round last week
And told me she's sick and tired of women

I'm still traveling trains delayed in the rain on a Monday morning
Watched by surveillance teams business men live out their dreams
And sleep with secretaries
In stockrooms over flowed with coffee and machines

While we're still riding
Trying to find a place where they're not watching
Called her up in the end
To apologize for being so drunk and stubborn
