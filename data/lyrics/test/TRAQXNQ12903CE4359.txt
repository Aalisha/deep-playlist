here there's snow, varina
it's new years eve
on the coast there's a girl that i know
with mountains in between

but when you pick up the phone i'm not there
and when you call me at home i'm not there
and when you need me the most i'm not there
surrounded by mountains, i'm scared
(i left the only place i knew...)
