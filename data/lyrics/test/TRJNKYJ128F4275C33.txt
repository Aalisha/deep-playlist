Holy Spirit, come and fill this place
Bring us healing with Your warm embrace
Show Your power make Your presence known
Holy Spirit, come fill this place
Holy Spirit, come fill this place

My heart is longing just to hear from You
My soul is waiting to know someone who
Can take us higher help us make it through
So will You please come and set us free

Holy Spirit, come and fill this place
Bring us healing with Your warm embrace
Show Your power, make Your presence known
Holy Spirit, come fill this place

Breath of God we need a touch from You
Shine down on us with the light of truth
