So you think you got it all worked out
You got your hotpants on
You got your arse right out, you
Think that you are something new and special
And me and my drab-dress, we won't do at all

I spent so long trying to fit the prototype
I kept on slipping in the heels and I never got it right, oh
What's the use?
What's the point?
You've got the wrong girl, oh

So you keep doing what you're doing down there
'Cause I'll be flying higher
Waste your own time, I don't care
Anything you can do, I can do better

All you girls, you look and flip your hair
And wonder why I'm still here, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But, baby, that's okay
All you girls, when you look into the mirror
Tell me how do you appear, well
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
You're superficial, I'm a misfit
But that's okay
...
