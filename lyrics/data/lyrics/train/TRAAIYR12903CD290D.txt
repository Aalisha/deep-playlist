You wanted love, you wanted love
But it's not she was thinking of
You step to the left, you step to the left
On your dancing feet now
Dancing feet, I can't compete
Now with your dancing feet now

Somebody gonna try and get to know now
Somebody gonna try to say it's all right now
Say it's all right now
