Baby.
Some tears never dry

I used to think that we could work it out
I used to think that if we had some problems
I always thought if there was love around
No matter what, I always thought we'll solve it

Now everyday we're in an argument
It's like a circle that don't ever end
We're keeping secrets and we're telling lies
Whatever's wrong, let's make it right
Cause I...

I don't wanna say goodbye
Cause my heart couldn't take it
Baby, give me one more try
I don't wanna have to cry
Cause I know if we lose it
Baby, some tears never dry
...
