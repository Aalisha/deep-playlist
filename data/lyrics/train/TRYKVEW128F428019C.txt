Don't you wanna be mad

I see the way you look at me
You envy me and it's killing you
And you know it makes me smile when I look in the mirror
Thinking how good it is to be king

And don't you wish you were me?
The king of all you see
And don't you wish you were me?
It ain't that easy

And don't think you'll ever be
Everything a man should be
'Cause don't you wish you were me?
Keep dreaming, you'll never be me

Too soon you'll be a memory
...
