Fed up with "made you look"
And dirty crooks without a clue
They all wear the same face
And it says, "Hangman, I'm onto you"

Hangman, it's not your fault
Commit this to memory
The bright ideas
Always get lost along the way

Last call for medicine
To count me in and turn me loose
I never meant to hide anything
But I'll never tell the truth
