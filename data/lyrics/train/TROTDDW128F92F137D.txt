Don't you ever leave me sad and blue
Don't you ever tell me we are though
Don't you ever hurt me if you do
Everything they're saying will be true

People say, it's just a summer romance
People say, our love won't last for long
They're so sure, we will part
But I know deep in my heart
That they are wrong

(Well, I don't care what the people say)
So wrong, (I don't really care what the people say)
