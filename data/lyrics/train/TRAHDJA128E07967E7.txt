From the old sod to the new land
We came over by the score
We cut the ties said goodbye
And closed the old world door
We settled on our praries
In your cities and your towns
There's another oatmeal savage
Every time you turn around

There's none more scots
That the scots abroad
There's a place in our hearts
For the old sod
There's none more scots
That the scots abroad
There's a place in our hearts
For the old sod

We soon found our own kind
Formed clubs and social nights
And we practised on each other
Just to keep our accents right
For there's more tartan here
Than in all the motherland
