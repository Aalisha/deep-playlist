This life of opulence has beaten all goodness right out of us.
Turning men to gods, then men to despicable parasites.
Nurturing indecency, incapable of true motherly love.
We spit on preconceived notions of compassion.
Everything's now subjected to termination.
A most voracious pack guided to the point of no-return.
Positivism is obsolete in a world filled with greedy consumers.
Only deceit and prejudices leads to such aberrations.
This life of opulence has beaten all goodness right out of us.
