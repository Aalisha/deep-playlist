You gave me this, made me give
Your silver grin, still sticking it in
You have soul machine, soul machine
The longest kiss, peeling furniture days
Drift madly to you, pollute my heart drain
You have broken in me, broken me
All your mental armor drags me down
Nothing hurts like your mouth, mouth, mouth
Your loaded smiles, pretty just desserts
Wish it all for you, so much it never hurts
