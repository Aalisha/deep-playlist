I think I saw your body 'fore I saw your face
Kinda moves you made were rockin' the place
Then your favourite song came on - the one you love
You came over to me, looked me in the eyes and said, "Push up"

You had your hands all over my body tonight
You didn't care about respectability
People starin' 'cause you really made a scene
It must have looked like we were doin' it for real
(You said)

Where I come from, we don't play around
And when it's time to party, we know how to get down
And where we're goin' baby, you don't have to worry 'bout a thing
Take my hand
Move your body up and down
And...

Push up
Your body, your body next to mine
Push up
I gotta make that sexy booty mine
Push up
And shake it, baby shake that ass
Push up
...
