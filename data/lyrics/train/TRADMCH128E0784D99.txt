I've lived in cold and freezing snow
Breathed the heat of steaming cold
And never ever be a part of me
I worked hard to scape the land
Did my job at shaking hands
But can't stand the fake that makes of me
Yeah I'm thirsty standing firmly
But your purpose just cant concern me
Man I know you'll take this personally

It doesn't mean that I hate you just cuz
I don't want you to do me no favors
No matter how hard you shake this hands
Can't break this man, can't break this man

It doesn't mean that I hate you just cuz
I don't want you to do me no favors
No matter how hard you shake this hands
Can't break this man, can't break this man

I've been to hell and felt the pain
