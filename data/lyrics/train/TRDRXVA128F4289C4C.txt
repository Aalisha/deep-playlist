Don't walk on eggshells for me 
I'm not as fragile as you think 
Stop making your words fancy 
Why say I don't know HER
When you actually do? 
Just tell me what you really mean 
Really mean 
When we're alone 
Why can't you tell the truth? 
When we're alone, you know what you should do 

Avoid reality 
As you dig yourself a hole 
Excuses are pathetic 
...
