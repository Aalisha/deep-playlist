Get the fuck away!

my decision is made
i got no time to fake this
i'm leaving the world behind me
i got no time to take this
my decision is made
i got no time to fake this
i'm leaving the world behind me
i got no time to take this
no

you don't believe it
you don't see it
always bleeding
you're going down

you got you got you got
the getaway
when times are rough we need to break away
