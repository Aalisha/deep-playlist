Standing here in the presence
Of something more that merely real
There are no words to describe you
Or explain the way I feel

As you speak I find healing for my soul
And your touch alone can make me whole.

And my heart cries Holy
And my spirit feels a change
As my heart cries Holy
I will never be the same
