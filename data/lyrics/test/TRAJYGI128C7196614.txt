Not a violent person, even heavens do get scared,
Lightning strikes around my heart, somethings coming near,
Never loved a soldier-man in a mail-man uniform,
Catch a burglar in my arms, has tipped off my alarm.

Man around the house,
Man around the house.

Listen to the music, to distract me from my fears,
Then I feel a sudden rush, and the lights disappear,
Never loved a fisher-man in a police uniform,
Catch a burglar in my arms, has tipped off my alarm.
