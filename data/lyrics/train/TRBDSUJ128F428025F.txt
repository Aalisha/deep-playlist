Do you see that thing?
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing?
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of night
The clouds are stuck like candy floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
...
