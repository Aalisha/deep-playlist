You only miss it when it's long gone
You only hear it when it's our song
These are the echoes of the dream time
This is a message from another life
This is a haunting of your own mind
These are the echoes of the dream time

You only miss it when it's long gone

I've been waking the dead
I've been leaning on tradition
Trying to make amends with the dead
Prayer candles that I burn at both ends

Missed opportunities we won't share again
...
