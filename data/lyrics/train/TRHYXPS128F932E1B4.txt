A simple hug keeps you safe from the frost,
We love to love when were living with the both of us.
As this twin channel is the symphony.

This is love it's fallen from above,
Maybe I don't say it enough no,
But you know you mean the world to me.

Done a lot of growing up in this last year,
I've lost my mind and I fear so,
Will I be dead and buried?

I never claimed to be no angel though,
I tell you in the songs I wrote,
The glass went smash that was in the past but hay... you know you mean the world to me.

I was in a bad place sent on a goose chase,
Was running on the long blue mile of sweet disgrace,
I'm taking this time to say sorry,
...
