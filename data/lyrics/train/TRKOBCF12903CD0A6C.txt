Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune, oh

Yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune

Send down from above, unconditionally love
Likened to a flower, stronger love grows by the hour
Stormy weather days make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Now you got me down on my knees, hey
