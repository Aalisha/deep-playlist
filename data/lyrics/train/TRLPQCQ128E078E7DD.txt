Now that you are here with me
Baby let's do it right
Lady you know just what I need
I want to hold you oh so tight

Baby just touch me anywhere
Cutie you turn me on
Ooh baby
Like to run my fingers through your hair
So come on and stay with me all night

I wanna rock wit'cha baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha lady
Feeling's so strong

I wanna rock wit'cha baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love don't you ever stop
No no sweet baby no...

How 'bout a little music now?
Let's hear some Marvin Gaye woo woo
