Sweet sixteen goes to church
Just to see the boys
Laughs and screams and giggles
At every little noise
Turns her face a little
And turns her head awhile
But everybody knows she's
Only putting on the style

She's putting on the agony
Putting on the style
That's what all the young folks
Are doing all the while
And as I look around me
I sometimes have to smile
Seeing all the young folks
Putting on the style

Well the young man in the hot rod car
Driving like he's mad
With a pair of yellow gloves
He's borrowed from his dad
He makes it roar so lively
Just to make his girlfriend smile
But she knows he's only
Putting on the style

He's putting on the agony
Putting on the style
That's what all the young folks
Are doing all the while
And as I look around me
I sometimes have to smile
Seeing all the young folks
Putting on the style

Preacher in the pulpit
Roars with all his might
Sing Glory Halleluja
Puts the folks all in a fright
Now you might think it's satan
That's a-coming down the aisle
But it's only our poor preacher boys
That's putting on his style

Putting on the agony
Putting on the style
That's what all the young folks
Are doing all the while
And as I look around me
I sometimes have to smile
Seeing all the young folks
Putting on the style

Putting on the agony
Putting on the style
That's what all the young folks
