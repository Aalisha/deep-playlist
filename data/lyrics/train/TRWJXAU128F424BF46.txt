Hey lady... lady
Uh I got your message you wanted to talk to me about something
Yea well before you do I... I have something I'd like to tell you
That might save a little time
Now, I know why you called
Cause you figured that uh,
You'd run some more of those funny changes on me
You know, tantilizing me, teasing me
You know, "you can come back"
And the minute that I get my hopes up in the air
You just crash me, you know, just dash me to the floor
Well, you can play all those games now because they don't affect me anymore
I can even think about you and feel no pain
Because I realized, in fact, that it was all game and that
You didn't really care about and if you did
You would've forgiven me and toke me back, you know
But uh, it's a game to you
But I'm a changed man now
Yea, yeaI'm the cat that went to Phoenix
But I got myself together; I don't drink anymore
You notice that I don't shake
I can hold my head up now
And I can look back on the past
And chalk that up as experience
Because, you see, I found out that you're not the only woman in the world
And there's always a woman out there
That'll take a man in her arms and make him forget about the past
And make him look forward to the future
And I got lucky; I stumbled on one

I've finally found somebody
To help me get over you
I've rid myself of all the changes
That you put me through
Now that the worst is over
My life is brand new
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it
Without you, yes I am
Without you, ah yea

Her lips are so much sweeter
