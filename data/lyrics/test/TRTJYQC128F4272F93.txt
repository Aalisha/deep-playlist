What a wonderful hesitation
who would bear to feel sorry for me
dropped another pill just to calm me
collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
there I was drifting
way out into the sunshine
expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
look at me I'm a tangled puppet
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive

find myself awake counting sad days
1-2-3 that's too many for me
dropped another pill just to find me
reached for my hand but it was already there
