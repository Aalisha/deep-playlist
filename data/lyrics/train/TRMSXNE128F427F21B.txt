Eveytime I wake up in the morning God is there
In the sun or even if it's storming God is there
Even in a crowd or if I'm all alone he's still there... still there
There's no place he'll let me go without him cause he's everywhere

& I can't live without you
I can't live
I can't live without you
I can't live
I can't live without you
I can't live
I can't live without you
I can't live
I can't live

When I'm way up on the mountaintop God is there
& yes when I'm low low low low
Way done in the vally he's still there

I'm grateful for the love you give to me
You've always been there in my time of need

I can't live without you
I can't live
I can't live without you
I can't live
...
