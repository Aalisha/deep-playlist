Mama's revolution has all gone into black
Sin through seven deadly holes, lines up behind your back
I do enjoy your company, we travel in a pack
Bloodstains and scars the badges of the green and black

You and me
Eternity
You and me
Forever we... fly

Hey maybe you're a minute away
You can't get her with nothing to say
