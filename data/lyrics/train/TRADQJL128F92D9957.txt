Clever liar, foolin' us all
Never thought I'd work it out
How could I have known it was ever about you boy?
Now there's nothin' to say, cos there's no words
And we're not talkin' anyhow
You must have known I was never to doubt you boy

If it was so fine, it was so good
Oh you're unbelievable
All this time I've been living without you boy
But not your lyin'
It felt so good, the world don't know
Now they'll never find out
How all these years she mustered beside you boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that you found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
