Oh, yeah, yeah-e-yeah

Just when I thought I was safe
You found me in my hiding place
I'd promised never again
I wouldn't give my heart, but then
Closer, closer I moved near you
The way I want you makes me fear you

Love breaks and love divides
Love laughs and love can make you cry
I can't believe the ways
That love can give
And love can take away

I find it hard to explain
It's crazy but it's happening
And I'm falling again
Much further than I've ever been
I'm falling deeper than the ocean
