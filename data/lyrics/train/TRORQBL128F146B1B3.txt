Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is a warmth that I thought I could never find

(Sitting here all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Whether to go on alone)
Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time
(Isn't time it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time
(Isn't time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night
