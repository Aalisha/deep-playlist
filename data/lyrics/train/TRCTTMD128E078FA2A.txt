I've seen your face somewhere before I swear
Could it be I've met you somewhere else
It's the way you turn and look at me
Your eyes are different but they're much the same

Have I seen you before
Have I seen you before

Heaven told me they took him somewhere
Have I seen you before
Heaven told me they took you somewhere
Have I seen you before
