Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame
Made a mistake, I made a mistake
I wear the scars to show my shame

What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one who can't get through
What should I do? What should I do?
When I'm the one hey, I'm the one to blame

I can't see past this chance
For us to reconcile these doubts!
They've all gone on for far too long
Yeah it goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
...
