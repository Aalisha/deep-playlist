You can get me right there where I want to be
Feeling it all over deep inside of me
Every time I think i'm close you take me closer
Even now when you're away I feel you near

You've got a way of making sun shine out the rain
You've got a way of turning ashes into flames
I can't believe you're making darkness into light
You're making all my contradictions turn out right

You're in my horizon everywhere I see
