[parrish smith]
You gots to chill. to chill. *echoes*

* dj k la boss cuts jungle boogie! *

[erick sermon]
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of epmd
Well you should keep quiet while the mc rap
But if you tired -- then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now -- I'm bout to shake'n'bake
The e-r-i-c-k is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an mc who talkin all that junk
About who can beat who, soundin like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say 'check one-two', and run down the line

[parrish smith]
To the average mc I'm known as the terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroy an employ', when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin your girl (why p? ) cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginnin -- I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain mc's while the double e macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
