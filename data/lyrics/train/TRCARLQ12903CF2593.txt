Did you ever wonder why the wind blows cold?
Did you ever realize your face is painted on my soul?

In between your whispers so sincere
I'll catch you when you fall
Through the eyes of broken innocence
I'd sell my heart for stones
Leave it all behind and fade away
To feel your purest blue
I can feel your purest blue, for you I must be strong
For I don't know right from wrong
