It's in the air
Tonight I feel the end
I've said goodbye
To all my useless friends

In your world
It all seems so sublime
The second hand
Ticks faster every time

And honestly I think you're wrong
I don't need you or anyone
To tell me it's okay

I can feel the storm rush in
And I want to let it all go
...
