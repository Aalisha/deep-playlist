The boys they have their eyes all over you
And you're loving every second of attention
I need to find just some way to get through
Or at least some way that I can mention

I'm feeling you
You're feeling me
What exactly is holding us back?
I'm feeling you
Are you feeling me?
Just give me something
Give me, give me, give me anything

Oh it's you
And it's true
You're electric
I can't get over it
Oh it's you
And it's true
You're electric
I can't get over it
...
