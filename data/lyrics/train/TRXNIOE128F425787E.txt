Goin' home, my baby
Goin' home, my baby
Goin' home, to see my baby

Our baby, how good
My baby, be good
I'm goin' home, my baby
Home to see my girl

Oh baby, baby, I'm coming home
Baby, baby I'm coming home
Tell me Mama, baby, I'm coming home

Gonna see my baby, see my baby fine
Gonna take my baby, want to take my baby mine
Gonna take my woman treats me real kind

I'm goin' home, my baby
I'm goin' home, to see my baby
Goin' home, my baby
