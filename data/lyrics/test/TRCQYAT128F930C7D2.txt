[Tom Englund]
We never saw this coming
Pride comes before a fall
We never heeded the warnings
Buried deep within us all

[Steve Lee] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Daniel Gildenlöw] Giant machines blot out our sun
[Steve Lee] Frozen minds becoming numb
[Daniel Gildenlöw] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Steve Lee] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Daniel Gildenlöw] I won't accept what we've become
[Steve Lee] We stand to lose more than we've won
[Daniel Gildenlöw] The Age of Shadows has begun

[Tom Englund]
Our quenchless thirst for knowledge
Our urge to change and grow
Our need to expand the nation
Made us rise from the depths below

[Steve Lee] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Daniel Gildenlöw] Giant machines blot out our sun
[Steve Lee] Frozen minds becoming numb
[Daniel Gildenlöw] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Steve Lee] The Age of Shadows has begun
[Daniel Gildenlöw] I won't accept what we've become
[Steve Lee] We stand to lose more than we've won
[Daniel Gildenlöw] The Age of Shadows has begun

[Hansi Kürsch] No more aggression
[Floor Jansen] No more initiative
[Hansi Kürsch] No more suppression
[Floor Jansen] No more emotions
[Hansi Kürsch] No more recession
[Floor Jansen] No more of all the feelings we shared that made us who we really are
[Hansi Kürsch] No more possessions
[Floor Jansen] No more euphoria
[Hansi Kürsch] No more obsessions
[Floor Jansen] No more sensations
[Hansi Kürsch] No more depression
[Floor Jansen] No more of all the passions that shaped our hearts and made us who we are

We Are Forever

[Jonas Renkse]
Time… but a passageway…
The beginning of the end…
An end that never was…
Time… but a curve in space…
