"Born Too Slow"

Just like seventies goofballs
he's waiting on last calls
well listen method man
'cause if you leave on the last line
don't leave on the ground kind
born just a little too slow
just a little too slow
just a little too
oh, your lives are more than two
just a little too
oh, just a little too
