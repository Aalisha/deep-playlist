Broken boys look good sitting on their shoes
Silent waves responds expose to fear
Library cards, rented faces, lying on the naked train
Hard parades with nothing skin
Things that breathe way too thin

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

Elevator, red blue stain, best of things
Half way between things and times, a kill
Library cards, rented faces, lying on the naked train
...
