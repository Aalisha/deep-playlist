Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it, well, am I cool yet?
'Cause it's the word of the knife that won't cut you up

And if we think about it, well, is it true yet?
'Cause there'S no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug

'Cause we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
