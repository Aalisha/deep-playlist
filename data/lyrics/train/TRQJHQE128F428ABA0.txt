Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Oh! Yeah.

I'm gonna start with the walls
Take the pictures off the walls
And burn 'em
Move the chairs around
Take the window curtains down
And burn 'em
Everything I see
Reminds me you were here
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
