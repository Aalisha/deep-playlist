Chorus
Say me a sit down pon a rock just a cool and relax
With the blue blue sky and the green green grass
Burn fe me herb please do not disturb
Ca me wan hear the sound of the two sweet bird

Verse
I wan find the way home
Where the sun shine and the animal roam
Where the sea flow and the wind get blown
Where me hair long right down to the ground
Where no one fuss and no one can moan
Where no one throw not a stick or a stone
Where no man rule and no man get crown
...
