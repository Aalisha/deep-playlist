Privileged
A chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision
The day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age
A shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass
It's only getting worse
Not worth a moment's regret
Each dawn another curse
Every breath a twisting blade
...
