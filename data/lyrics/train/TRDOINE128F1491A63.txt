Ho, yeah, come on, come on, come on
Come on and do it
Ho, yeah
Come on and do it
Do it, do it, do it

It's just another thing you gotta keep your eye fixed on the road
Do what your mama said, I will not be told
Keep your mouth shut, keep your legs shut, go back in your place
Blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace

Who cares what they say because rules are for breaking (I said)
Who made them anyway you gotta show what you feel, don't hide

Come on and do it, don't care how you look it's just how you feel
Come on and do it, you've gotta make it real
Come on and do it, it's time to free what's in your soul
You gotta get it right this time, come on freak and lose control
