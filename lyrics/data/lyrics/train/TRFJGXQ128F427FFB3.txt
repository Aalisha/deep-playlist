I got everything I want in my life except a girlfriend
Woo

Ah, B2K

Just coped a Bentely and it's parked in my garage
its 2: 00 im pullin' in for my massage
and everywhere they know just who we are
there they go, it's them ghetto superstars

the latest throwbacks and them ones on my feet
get out the benz and then i'm off up the jeep
takein flicks with chicks that look like 'licia keys
all of that i'm still missing one thing (whoa)

a girlfriend(hey) girlfriend (everything i wanted)
i need a girlfriend (yeah) girlfriend (and everything i)
girlfriend (oh) girlfriend (would you be my)
would you be my girlfriend (hey), girlfriend
