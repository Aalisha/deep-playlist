See another day
I try to kill the time
But this time it stays alive

You could say
I'm a long distance caller
40 minute action
And a 10 hour drive

Some dreams come true
That's one thing I know
And girl
I've got 20 more days to go

20 more days to go
20 more days to go
20 more days to go
20 more days to go
To go

I see another day
...
