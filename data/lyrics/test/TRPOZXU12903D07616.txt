Mindless.
This mindless flesh that devours,
it keeps me bound at the bottom.
And to live in this flesh
will keep me bound by myself.

Hollowed out your heart to live this way.
Was it that hard to let love fade?
Lashing out, yet reserved.
The mindless are easily lured
in pain and perverse.

Lured to this dream alluring to the skies
to live among them and to never die, never die.
