Yeah, after dah shinin', it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now

Jah, rastafarai
Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes

Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits?

Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimmage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish

As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin', I need some air

I think, I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I posess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics

'Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress

In case of home intrusion, first the dogs go bark
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like [Unverified] does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash

When that gun blast, better have jah on your side
Or an act of divine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggaz, who hold the greed to sling 'Frills'

Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
