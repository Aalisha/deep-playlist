Of all the things that you do best,
Disaster makes you happiest.
So burn the clothes that you are in,
They stink of smoke and sweat and skin.

And you cry 'cos I'm so calm inside
You scream, you sob, "I'll run, I'll hide"
And still we have no answer to
The question: What do we do?

Oh, let's stop hanging out
Let's stop hanging fun
Stand in the corner
And think about what you've done

Oh it's easy to over simplify
When you are not involved
And I get so angry when someone can say
"The answer's there - as clear as day!"

And there is a possibility
That you could still cling on to me
...
