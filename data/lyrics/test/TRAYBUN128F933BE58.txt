a t t e m p t e d s u i c i d e

you don't say but it still shows
acting like no one knows
turn your cheek and start to fret
some how you always forget

but all you've got is what you're given
you think you're driving but you're being driven

attempted suicide

seeds of doubt start to shape
start looking for a new escape
circumstance you distort
you still act like it's your last resort

but all you've got is what you're given
you think you're driving but you're being driven

don't you ever tire of what's expected?
