She was about five foot three
Heavenly complected an' you know me
I ran in her direction 'cause I had to see
If what was goin' on was really goin' on

She had almond eyes
Hair that ran down to her chocolate thighs
Had a playa shook like,? My, my, my?
Yeah, every word I tried to say
Wouldn't come out right

Baby girl had it goin' on
The way her jeans hugged her hips
Just turned me on
An' the shape of her lips, hotter than the sun
I wish that she could be the one

You used to be my man's girl
I wish that you would be my girl
No matter what people say
Girl, they won't change the way I feel

Girl, you used to be my man's girl
I wish that you could be my girl
Now tell me what I got to say
Just tell me what I got to say
