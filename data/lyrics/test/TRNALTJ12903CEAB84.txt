You told me one
You told me two
You told me ten thousand lies, little girl
You told me ten thousand lies
Well you told me more lies
Than stars in the sky
You'll never get to heaven when you die, little girl
You'll never get to heaven when you die

Chorus:

I'm fallin' on my knees
And I'm beggin' you please
Won't you come along and stand by me, little girl
Won't you come along and stand by me
