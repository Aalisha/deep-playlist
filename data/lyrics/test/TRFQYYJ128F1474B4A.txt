It's never gonna work, I don't know what I'm doing in here
My evenings go beserk every time your voice gets near
But when I get under control, I see you ache for it and all
I've got some sugar for your bowl
I've got some loving for your soul
Some twinkle for your eyes, I
Getting sick of being just alone

They think it's not right, fine
Each to their very little own

I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And that's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now
...
