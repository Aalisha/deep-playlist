Shake me, could it be I'm dreamin'
Don't wake me 'cause it's real
I'm caught up in the web he's weavin'g
Believing what I feel

It happens every time I'm near him
I revered him from the start
How can I show him all the secrets
Of my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, he's the one
He's a million dollar babe, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, he's the one
He's a million dollar babe, whoa

Million dollar babe

How can my love make a difference
Surrender is the key
Give him something to remember
The better part of me
