Very soon I will be
In the deep blue sea
Wrapped in chicken wire
By my own device

The navy'll come
The sharks will bite
It will be so hard to fight
Wrapped in chicken wire
By my own device

Mama, don't go
Mama, don't leave me, Lord

Wall to wall
The carpet crawls
Up the stairs and down the hall
To the invalid
...
