The temptation is all too great
To know it's gone and it's all too late
I tried and I tried, but I never applied
To any of the morals that I wish I had

You wait 50 whole weeks
Through all of your hides and all of your seeks
When the time finally arrives
It dawns on me that your attention derives
From the girlfriend that you left at home
Sitting in the living room all alone

You hate the suntan
And you can't stand to be around the short sleeved man
And the gaggle of girls that are singing too loud
Well, they do my head in

You hate the tattoos
