If it makes no difference
Then let me solve a mystery
If it's confidential
Just let me know that some are real
'Cause when you think it's love, love, love
It all turns into history
The way that it happened to us.

Well I know you said it all would last
But it all went away so fast.
And I thought that the hurt would pass
But it still keeps on comin' back.

Can you feel my heart beat
Beneath the silver lights tonight?
Does it make you wonder
'Bout all the things that pass us by?
