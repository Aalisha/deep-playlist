Now tell me baby
How do you want your rollin' done?
Now tell me baby
How do you want your rollin' done?

I want you to start in the mornin' baby
And roll me with the settin' of the sun

Oh, roll me on my belly baby
Feed me with your chocolate drop
Oh, roll me on my belly baby
Feed me with your chocolate drop
