Rock with me
Rock with me baby
Roll with me
Roll with me honey

Rock with me
Rock with me woman all night long

Bless my soul
I don't know what is wrong with me
I don't want to go
Woman can't you see

Rock with me
Rock with me woman all night long
All night long

You're the sweetest rocker in town
And I love to see you go 'round
You're the sweetest rocker in town
