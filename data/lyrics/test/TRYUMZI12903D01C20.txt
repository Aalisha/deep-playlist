Casey Jones

Come all you rounders
If you want to hear
The story of a brave engineer
Casey Jones
Was the rounder's name
On the big six wheeler
Boys he made his fame

Well the caller called Casey
'bout half past four
He kissed his wife
At the station door
He stepped into the cabin
With the orders in his hand
Said I'm gonna to take my trip
To the promised land

Casey Jones
Stepped into the cabin
Casey Jones
Orders in his hand
Casey Jones
Stepped into the cabin
Said I'm gonna to take my trip
To the promised land
