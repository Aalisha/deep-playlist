You call me on the telephone
And you say you'll never do it again
But you've hurt me once too often dear
And it's just a little late to repent

All your beggin' and pleadin' won't help you
And your lying' and cheatin' I'll take no more
'Cause I told you before and I'll tell you again

You liar, liar
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late

'Cause I know that I never wanna see you again
And now don't you go tellin' lies about me to your friends
'Cause I've heard them before and you know it
Then I've taken this long just to show it
So take all of your heartaches and leave me alone
