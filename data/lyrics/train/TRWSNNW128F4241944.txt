The Click Five - My Girlfriend


I got a cell phone, trampoline, a years worth of magazines
I even got a new pair of Chucks

I got a surfboard, swimming pool, a mustang convertible
But still didn't get enough

I got everything I wanted on my list
Except for one thing that I missed

Just a kiss

My girlfriend forgot me this Christmas day
Heyy yeah
My girlfriend forgot me this Christmas day
She was all I wanted
This
This Christmas
