Sing out! Calypso Lady! Come on!
People dancing everywhere

Calypso music in the air.
Lady
you're driving me crazy all night

I need your loving
but all you do is tease me

and that ain't right.

People dancing everywhere
Calypso music in the air

Oh
you're driving me wild
Calypso Lady.
People dancing all oround
Calypso Lady
shake it down

Oh
when you're driving me wild
Calypso crazy.
