Swim, Swim for your lives
Things are getting restless out at sea
Swim, Swim for your lives
Things are getting restless out at sea

Can you see the lighthouse
As we push you under
Can you see the light
As we push you further from shore

Can we hear their cries
Over the storm
Will we reach out to help
I'm thinking no

I'm convinced that they're drowning out there
(I'll be standing on the dry shore)
I'm still convinced that this
This isn't the way it's supposed to be
(I'll be safe from the storm)

We're all dressed up
Like something we're not
You'd better
...
