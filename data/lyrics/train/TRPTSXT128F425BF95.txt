My word on everything, I mean everything
We will never stop, I mean never
Nigga we da best


I'm a get it for life
Get it for us, get it for love, I'm a keep it alive (yeah, yeah) oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
I'm a get it for life (Get it for life)
Get it for you, get it for me, get it tonight (yeah, yeah)
I'm a sacrifice (yeah, yeah)
I'm a get it for life

(Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack crack ca-crack crack)
Nigga was ain't never stoppin, nigga we da best


Coca, niggas call me crack in the flesh
Run up on a nigga with a mac'in adress
Hear dat rip through his vest
If you ain't got sticks well you better invest (yes)
A nigga used to dream of that water blue
Now I swapped out for sumtin with killer view
Fresh off the block doin interviews
You can still see the coke on my linen suit
I'm a don, change twice a day
I do it for the love when there's so much hate
Straight out the court room, million dollar bail
Back to the spot, got a million dollar sale
