His tears are running in the fire, 
Whose flames are burning his eyes 
He's running on some dusty waves believing
He can't reach the sea, 
Lost in silent Height invaded 
With a steaming mist and by the wind, 
Swept away
Sad ephemeral creature, 
Moaning on earth
His sight gets lost on those immensities
...
