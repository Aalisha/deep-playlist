Let it never be said that the romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else occupying my head
There is nothing I need except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed, doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Aha-aha-aaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Aha-aha-aaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa

Due to lack of interest, tomorrow is canceled
