Just like another speck of dust that's on the highway of life,
He Screams at anyone who'll listen that the end is in sight,
So then he circles the wagons or he just circles then quits
Cause the Highway could become the final battling pit
So when the company wants, Another problem resolved,
Or if the company wants a choice of nothing at all,
Point your thumb out to the highway through the heat and the dust,
And raise your finger in the middle till you shout:

"What About Us!" [Repeat: x 4]

Just like another last call, it means nothing at all,
You either kiss a lot of ass, or tear the clock off the wall,
Another warning ignored another sign of the times,
They say the sky is gonna fall, so why not drink till your blind
...
