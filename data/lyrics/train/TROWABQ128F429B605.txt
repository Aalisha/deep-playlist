Have you ever been lost?
Floating on the ground
Like a fading frost
Falling asleep next to the bed
And you feel so low

Oh, they've stolen your pride
Stand up while your conscience
Sits inside
I've made up my mind
I feel the time
And I feel so low

Stay and highjack the hurt
I feel so low, I feel so high
Take a look inside my mind
...
