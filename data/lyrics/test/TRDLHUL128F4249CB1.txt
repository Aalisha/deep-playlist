You look worse in the afternoon
When the light fades into your skin
You spend too much time indoors shouting "Fake!" at the walls
I thought, I thought that wars were fought for this

Like zombies are crawling out over the top
How your girlfriend is convinced but you are not
Until the garage rock assimilates

So you raise your middle finger to the garage rock
Like zombies are crawling out over the top
