Faces of life facing their death
Cyanide thrills pulling em back
Snake in the grass, face in the clouds
Facing the wind, a face in the crowd

Throughout your frustration
Go along with all the fucking lies
Can't help your situation - WHY?!

Doing it up, you never come down
Digging the hole, you're dead in the ground
Facing your front while flat on your back
Laughing it up now cover the tracks

Scratch off the crustation
never kills any pain that you hide
Might help your situation
But you don't even care about it
