Nowhere To Run 
Nowhere To Hide 
What You Doin' To Me 
All This Jive 
I Can See It 'Fore The Light Of Day 
'Cause Now You're Gonna', Gonna' Do It My Way 
You Are 

Say What You Will, You Will 
Say What You Will 

Don't Push Me Around, If You Don't Mind 
But You Keep On Doin' It To Me All The Time 
...
