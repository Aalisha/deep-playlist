Fun
Ummm.
Hold on 1 minute
Fun

Hello, Hi yeah it's me.
Yeah look I'm going 2 b home again late OK, alright yeah bye-bye.
This isn't my idea of fun
Say I'm not going to be the one
This isn't my idea of fun at all at all at all at all at all

Love is meant 2 b so beautiful
Unconditional has it downs as well as highs
So Wonderful
Am I supposed to be amazed
Or is this compulsory
I know love to well
My mind drifts alone
You never comes with me.
This isn't my idea of fun
Oh No

This isn't my idea of fun
