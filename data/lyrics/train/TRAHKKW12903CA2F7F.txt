[chorus: repeat 2x]
Y'all don't wanna war wit us, in this steel we trust
When there's beef best believe we bust
We can take it how you want it cuz we thuggin over here
Pure, uncut, raw butter over here

[yukon]
Yo you see the game getting better this year
They done put p with afficial something better in here
I'm tryin to take em where they ain't been
Somethin out they price range
Ain't in they budget, you know they can't spend
Where we at, in a league of our own
And i know this chick now i'm tryin to meet at my home
So they can see the goods i got
About how there's one in every neighborhood
Strangers feel like they're tourin blocks
You know it ain't too hard to tell
That every member of my street team ain't too far from jail
And if he down then his book's healthy
You see, i don't only talk about the cars and the cribs, i look wealthy
Beef ain't a problem with us now
And nigga you can get as loud as you want, we hollow in the pound
And let em think they playin with that
And imma show em with one squeeze, how 16's spray in ya back

[chorus]
