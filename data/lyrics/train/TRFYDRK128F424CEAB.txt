On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists

The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
We have exposed the night, from which the feeble flee
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise

Brandish new force, like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
