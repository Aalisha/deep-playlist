When I listen
When I hear and never listen
It makes me wonder, makes me bleed

Make me see, make me listen, make me wonder
Make me feel, make me dream and still remember
More, no more, no less, no more to find

Breathe, bleeding, haunting, silently
Enough just to feel
Escaping, missing, silently
Once beautiful

Make me see, make me listen, make me wonder
Make me feel, make me dream and not surrender

As my voice, it's silent
...
