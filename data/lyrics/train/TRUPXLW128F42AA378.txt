Africa, Africa
Africa wants to be free
Mama Africa
Africa wants to be free

Africa, Africa
Africa wants to be free
Mama Africa
Africa wants to be free

I know their system
Is a plot against my people
But if Jah be for us
Nobody can be against us
If Jah is for my people
I don't know who can try
Who can try to be my enemy
My Africa wants to be free

Oh Africa, Africa
Africa wants to be free
Mama Africa
Africa wants to be free

Oh Africa, Africa
Africa wants to be free
Mama Africa
