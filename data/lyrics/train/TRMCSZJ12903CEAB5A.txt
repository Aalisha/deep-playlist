Oh (oh oh, oh, oh) (repeat 4x)

()
Finding a reason to fall away, do it again
Never a solution, the reason that I stray
But oh Lord, You've been there for me
You opened my eyes so I could see
I'll never, never, never leave you, no no never again!

Never leave me no!
(No no, no) (repeat 2x)

()
Oh, You've been there for me, never never left me alone
(Never alone)
Now I'm willing to be used by oh
You keep giving me brand new mercies, 'cause You care about me
(Care about me)
You're holding my hand, You help me to stand

(Bridge)
