Agony inside me
Enemies surround me
Misery confide in me
Your soul soaked in sickness
Being plagued with weakness
Fill your world with meekness
Drowning deep in sadness
You can't take the madness
Cover you with blindness
My eyes fill with anger
Your world fills with danger
My ears hear your laughter
All my senses going dead and
All my vision... all my vision turning red
Upon your world I'm descending
In this hell where... in this hell that I can't rest
...
