I see you but I can't believe you're here
I can't believe you're near enough for me to touch
Why you're wanting me so much?

You're back
Back for one more try
But you should realize that things are different now
Ever since you quit

Coming around, bringing me down, I said we were through, now I'm over you

But you could change my mind
Little girl, if you wanted to
When you look at me the way you do
I'm easy, so damn easy
You look so good and you look so fine
Girl, you know
