There's so much I want to say now
But it's too late i know
There's no way to heal these wounds now
And my heart bleeds for you

And our love is crashing 
Like a tidal wave
Coming over me

So I wanted you to know
That i finally let you go
After all i've held on to
This is my goodbye to you
I was always there for you
But you never saw the truth
And the reason that i know
Is i've finally let you go
