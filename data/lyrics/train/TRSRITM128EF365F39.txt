Dust is the one
She provides all the fun
And we're all falling down in a heap on the floor
We're falling around
Pleading for more
And shell shocked eyes keep shooting their lies
As she lays down the law and the god given line
She lays down the law
We cut it fine

This is child's play
This is child's play

Snow in Berlin and she freezes my skuin
...
