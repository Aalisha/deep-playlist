I dialed your number on the phone yesterday,
Thinkin' you would answer, and then I remembered.
A conversation we had had not so long ago,
Talkin' about our love, and why we let it go.
We both agreed the timin' wasn't right.
And you said somethin', I'll never forget that night.

Some things get lost, some things just disappear,
But not my love for you, I'll keep that close and near.
Some things just fade like scars and dreams,
I've got your heart right here with me.
