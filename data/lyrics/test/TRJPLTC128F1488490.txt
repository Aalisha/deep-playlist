Oho
Let it flow

What's up girl?
Tell me what you trying do to tonight
And I try to cope girl
Better you planning coming by
You with your friends girl
When you gotta tell your girls goodbye
Then you gotta stop by the store and
Playing working lie (.?.)
I'm a (.?.) that you love
You know how I get down
When you walk in the door and no playing around
But the kissing, hugging, rubbing, touching
About this flowing and all that good loving.
Wud you gotta get out of your clothes
Girl let me get take to control
Let it flow, (let it flow)
