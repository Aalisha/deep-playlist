Yeah

(Chorus) (Everlast)
Cool as a summer breeze
Drifting on memory
She got me on my knee
But darlin' I'm begging, please
And if there's a winter storm
And I'm there to keep you warm
In whatever shape or form
Baby girl gotta put me on

(Mad Child)
It's been ten years runnin' and you still look stunnin'
One in a million, Diamond, you're beautiful with brilliance
Still it's not enough, even though we're inseparable
We need to take a break but that don't mean that I'll let you go
Tears become streams, we got the same dreams
What's with all the competition, Ma? We on the same team
Angel, sometimes I don't show it on the surface
But, your face is unreplacable, it's perfect, you're worth it
I'm not always there emotionally, even though you're close to me
I got work to do, that's how its supposed to be
And I ain't into choppin' it up
I'll switch your top but don't trip, got you a brand new whip
And took you shoppin', it's cool
Just do your thing while I work on this music shit
If we don't end up back together, though Imma lose it, kid
