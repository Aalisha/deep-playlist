Are you listening, Javelina?
Every corner of the coast is still clear
All dressed up
With some medicine for luck
How I hope that you're still here
When I return

Burning bridges is a form of suicide
I saw the fires as the ghost of my life
Passed me by and there's nowhere you can hide
From the lessons or the lies that bind them

I'm so tired
I've had enough
If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned
But you'll never give it up

Can we count on our conversations
...
