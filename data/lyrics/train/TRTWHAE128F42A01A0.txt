When was it that you lost your youth or traded
It for something more for them to use, so jaded
Why is it that you never said I love you more than just a friend?
I pray this gridlock never ends and when we get there just depends

I found out recently that you are leaving
For good I hope I softly tell my ceiling
It's better now to be alive, sleeping is my 9 to 5
I'm having nightmares all the time of running out of words that rhyme

Everything that you could never say
Would never matter anyway
I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago
