Mama keeps tryin' to get the game on the radioDaddy's gotta know the score
There's a big yellow thing on a flat bed trailer
Wonder what that thing's forWe got towels rolled up in the back seat window
Keeping us out of the sunJust a hundred more miles and we'll be at grandma's
Sure is gonna be fun
Maybe she'll take us fishin'
Maybe she'll bake us a pieRemember like she did that one time
Back before grandpa died

It's Memorial Day in America
Everybody's on the road
Let's remember our fallen heroes
Y'all be sure and drive slow

Ninety eight degrees in the shade of the tool shed
Can't go back in the house
They're all in the kitchen yellin' bout something
