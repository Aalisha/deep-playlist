[Kardinal Offishall]
Light it up,
Everybody, light it up,
To Kardinal light it up,
Everybody, Light it up

[Keri Hilson]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number 1
Number 1, number 1

[Kardinal Offishall]
She's just my part time lover
Pretty little thing
Nottin' I will never think about giving a ring
Nottin' but a pretty little one night fling
Even though she want to be the queen to my king
She ain't nottin but a word for my ginsing
Someone I would use to bust my boxspring
She woulda a numba one, not be bada bing
Bad man not goin bother wit da wife, wife ting
She gotta know she the girl on the side
On my left on the rest but numba two on my mind
There's no way she could ever be my girl
But she steady trying to come into my world

[Keri Hilson]
The tide is high but I'm holding on
