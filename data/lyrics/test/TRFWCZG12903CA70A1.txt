You try to knock me down
With all your wrongs and rights
I'll go down swinging
I haven't yet begun to fight
You want so bad for me
To grow to be like you
But that's the last thing
I'll ever fucking do
You're never happy
Cause you work a job you hate
So bitter at the world
So sorry of your fate
I'll keep on pushing
...
