You love the righteousness you feel
That no soul was lost to make your meal
You challenge everyone's ideals
You're sure to let your won congeal

How blessed to be adorned
The queen of the informed

You're a friend of the just, of course
If their agendas are just like yours
The only cause you don't endorse
Is just say, no one but my kind
Has an open mind

I question other's sanity
While I'm handcuffed to evergreens
But if your view opposes mine
I'll flip you off and wave a sign
...
