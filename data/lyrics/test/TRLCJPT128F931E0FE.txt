A lot of these cats out here be fakin
When it comes to makin love
But you and me baby
This is real
And that's why it's...

(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Ooh (this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl
You better ask somebody.

Can't nobody do it like us
Can't nobody mix chop and screw it like us
All over the living room hittin it like us
In the middle of the night wake up the building like us
But it's oookay if you wanna brag
The sex so good
Go and pat yourself on the back
And them haaaters, they gon hate
But we just gon keep on blowing up cause girl
They gon hate, anyway
You are now rocking with the best (best, best, best...)
I'll make you forget about the rest (rest, rest, rest...)
Having sex with you is like makin hits
Girl we got egos they can't tell us that we ain't the shit
I'm in your mix like a number one record
And the beat goes on and on
And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day
And i love it when you take me down and make me say-ay.

(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Ooh (this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl, ohh
