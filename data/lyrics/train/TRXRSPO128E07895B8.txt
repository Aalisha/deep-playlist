No more inferiority will ruin this, our lives
To step outside the boundaries of just the will to survive

Come inside, fell your life slip from your grasp
To your religion you clasp
A fear that is new pours into you, tearing your soul
Release the unknown
Dethroning the old, crowning the young, rightful heir
The time has come

Religion has died
All shall melt under one sign
Relinquish your life
A new lease of power has been sent forth
