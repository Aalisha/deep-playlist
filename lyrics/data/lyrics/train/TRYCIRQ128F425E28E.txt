If you're down in the dumps we'll lend a hand
You can rely on us we're in command
You won with all the glory, you stood right by our side
You don't need a place to hide

Don't hide
We're on your side
Don't hide
We'll stand by your side
So don't hide

You stood right by my side you'll learn to fight, well alright
Just lift your head up high you have the right
You won with all the glory, you stood right by our side
You don't need a place to hide

Don't hide
