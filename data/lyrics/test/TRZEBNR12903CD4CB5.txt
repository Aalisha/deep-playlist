The tide is turning
Its coming from the street
Read your own wisdom
Not the headlines
Don't let them tell you
Its fine the way it is
Its our agenda
We know better

Let the people have their say
Let the people show the way
Every woman child and man
Has the power in this land

Now don't you worry
The future will unfold
If we are open and ready
We all have choices
Not just the chosen few
So raise your voices
Hold them steady

Let the people have their say
Let the people show the way
Every woman child and man
Has the power in this land
