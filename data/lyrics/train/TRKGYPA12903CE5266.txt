Body and soul, an animal
As a sword, swing double edged
Dig deep down, that monthly frown
You have the tools, to make men fools

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Cleopatra, the rat catcher
Preambling eyeball shopping
Measuring, your next victim
Too good to be sin, far too entertaining
