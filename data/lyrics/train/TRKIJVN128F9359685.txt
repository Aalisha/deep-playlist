You can take the money
You can take the ride
You can take it all but never get inside
You can't take my honor
You can't take my soul
You can't take the fact you'll never have control

You won't break me
No matter how hard you try
You can't shake me down
I'm fucking bulletproof

All I learn - it's like poison
All I know - inside my veins
All I see - it's like venom
All I know - it's all that remains
...
