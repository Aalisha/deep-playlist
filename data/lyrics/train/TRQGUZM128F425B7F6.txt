Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm worried about the future holds, the future holds
I'm starting to worry about Ray
Truth be told, the truth be told
I'm worried about the future holds, the future holds
I'm seriously worried about Ray

They say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
They say the future's out to get you
You know that I won't let you fall
