Like a cool water from an oasis
That's how you came to me
In my image of excellence and passion
Were my eyes mistreating me?

It's not fair how you broke down my defences
Was it really true that you weren't free
Oh I don't care 'cause I'm living for the moment
Remembering the very first time
My heart beats like a drum
My heart beats
Heart beats like a drum
My heart beats
Heart beats like a drum
Now I'm caught

Caught in the middle of love
