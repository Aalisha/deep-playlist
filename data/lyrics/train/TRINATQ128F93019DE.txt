Dododo dobedodododododododo dododo oh yeah

For quite some time I been trying my very best
Hope to get real close to you
It seems my best efforts had no real effect
And there's no way that I can get through to you

So my intentions are strictly honorable
Throughout the years that I've known you
Hoping within your heart you'll be there, willing and able
See I want you and this time I gotta get you

Hard to get, is there something that I'm doing wrong
Hard to get, oh yeah is that the game you're playing
Hard to get, oh girl won't you stop for wasting time
Hard to get, oh yeah can't you see I wanna make you mine

See I've been trying so many ways to win your attention
But it seems I can't please you
