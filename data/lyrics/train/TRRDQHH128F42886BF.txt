Life Goes On
Angie Stone
(Mahogany Soul)

(Intro)
One for the road
Check it
Kind of natural, yeah

Look at then and when you got caught up
Reminiscing 'bout the past
Driving by on easy street
Thinking 'bout that we'd be here to last a long while
And real talks, every night and then an arguement
But all in all we both knew
If nothing else, our love was heaven sent
