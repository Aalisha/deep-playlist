I don't wanna stand beside you
I don't wanna try and feel the pain you're going through
'til the death you'll see this through.

Cold sweats, hallucinations
I wanna scream to show
The hell I'm going through
The addiction's taken you.

Can you see me through bloodshot eyes (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?

I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me.
I will fight, one more fight
I am not the enemy.
I will try one last time
Are you listening to me?
