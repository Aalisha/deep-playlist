All this work means nothing without you
It's elementary at best
When your voice is the one thing that wakes up the morning
Just lay my heart to rest

It's water under the bridge
You say it's gone when it passes here
And you won't bring it up again, so I won't bring it up again
It's water under the bridge
You say it's gone when it passes here
