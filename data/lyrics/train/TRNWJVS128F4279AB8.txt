Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where
Your crystal mind and

Magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic a cherry cola
I don't need to try and explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again I might move
So slightly

To the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball
That I need to I want to
Come stand a little bit closer

Breath in and get a bit higher
Youll never know what hit you
When I get to you
Ooh I want you

I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
