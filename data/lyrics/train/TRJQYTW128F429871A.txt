When you're Dying - giving up hope
Living for smoking dope
Singing that same old song
Yeah yeah yeah it's always the same

I got no
I got no
I got no nothing in mind

I got no
I got no
I got no nothing in mind

I was trying a new adventure
Buyin' that old peer pressure
Wasting my mind away 
but I saved it just in time
