Roaming the plains
where a number is your name
In a palace
And you'll never find the door
Oh look into the mirror
Is it what you wanna see
Or just a cuddle toy
The vogue has washed ashore

No I don't care what you say
Into the darkness I plough my way
I'm striking out for paradise
To be the one I am
