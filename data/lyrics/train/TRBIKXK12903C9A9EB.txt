You say that you love me
All of the time
You say that you need me
You'll always be mine

I'm feeling glad all over
Yes I'm-a glad all over
Baby I'm glad all over
So glad you're mine

I'll make you happy
You'll never be blue
You'll have no sorrow
'Cause I'll always be true

And I'm feeling glad all over
Yes I'm-a glad all over
...
