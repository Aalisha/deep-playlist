You can't hide it from me, admit it baby
'Cause I'm wise to your disguise
I've seen you love me with your eyes

Even if you think I'm a fool and I just can't tell
You don't know me well
Won't you come over here and break the ice
It would be so nice

It's what you want when you're around me
You're a little bit shy, and I feel the need
And I can tell that you're happy you found me...
Just give it up...

Why wait around when you know that you feel it (give it up)
I look through your eyes, I can see that you want somebody (give it up)
Make you feel so good to get into it
Give it up, give it up
You want it baby
Give it up, give it up
You know you got me
Come on, come on, come on and give it up

I can't, I can't lie... to you
...
