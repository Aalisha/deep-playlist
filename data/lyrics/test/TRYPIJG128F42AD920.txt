Your soul is my desire. Desire I can't control
Be still my aching heart. Each beat you have stole
Your mind calls to me. Calls me closer to you
Be calm my aching heart. The ache drives me to you
Your eyes. The depth I see. So deep
The tears you cry will devour me

A flower to behold
Don't run. Don't blow away
Breathless to my eyes
So bright. Never to fade
Calmness and mystery
Entwines and captivates me
Delicate to the touch
