Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (so broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go
Scream my lungs out
Try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go
There's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one
