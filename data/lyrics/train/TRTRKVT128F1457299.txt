I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream
You'll always be

Until the end of time
I look in your eyes
They touch my soul
My love is hard to hide

I'm never alone when we're apart
I feel you by my side
And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be

I know who you are
So lock the door
And throw away the key
Save all your love

Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
...
