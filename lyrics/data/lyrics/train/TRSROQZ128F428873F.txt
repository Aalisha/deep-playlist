This is for all my love makers
sit back and relax
And let me take you there

It's three o'clock in the morning
There's only one thing to do
Girl your body's crazy, laying next to mine
i tried my best to keep my cool
but the temperature's steady rising
Cause i'm all alone with you
And your sexy ways, are so inviting
Damn I wanna give it to you

Baby come and take my hand
I just wanna freak you
(Girl i got what you want, now its time for you to
climb up on top of me)

Chorus:
Girl i want you
on top of me
