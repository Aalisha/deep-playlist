Breathe hallucinations start to fade
All the colours slip back to grey
I never understood these things I've hated
But now as we all disappear
The world becomes quite clearly something I can't live in
If I could just get through

Tonight the poisons in my head
And I cant feel my legs
I'm not feeling anything

I'm standing at the top looking down
Thought it'd be so free
Floating out in space take a breath
Don't you breathe too deep
Standing at the top looking down
Thought it'd be so damn easy
I thought it would be easier
