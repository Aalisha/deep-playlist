Meet me at midnight the broadcast tower
high above the hollywood sign
you bring your guitair and i'll bring my radio... radio
everyone look up for miles around
to witness this beautiful sight
we'll set bonfires, pretend it's the fourth of july

this is the starting of a brand new revolution
bite the hand that feeds
stand up and fight against the messages that they're sending
stop their frequency

you're always talking it's neverending
i's about time that we turned off the radio
call the request lines and tell them that it's over
you're always playing all of the same songs
over and over again
it's about time that we all turned off the radio
...
