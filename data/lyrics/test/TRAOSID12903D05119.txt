The prodigal son, he'd been away awhile
He was workin' his way back home now
Over many a ragged mile
When he finally crossed the river
And his father saw him near
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear

I listened to what the Good Book said
And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
People tryin' to be free
Now we got new names and faces
This time around
Gospel changes, Lord
Still goin' down

Jesus, He did not doubt His gift
Though He knew that He had not long to live
