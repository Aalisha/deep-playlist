Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star

Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star

So inviting, so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
Oh yeah
