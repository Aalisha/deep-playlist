Hey, uh, babe
Sweet, uh, baby
Come on, come on, my ba-ay-by

Lay right down, relax, unwind

Ooh, boy I know just how you feel
With a girl, straight forward & so real
Come real close
And don't be shy
I'll give you good love
Don't ask me why, yeah

Ooh, I feel what I say
Believe it, I'm real
Ain't no time to be fake
I see what I want
And I go for mine
So come get it now
Don't ask questions 'til the end

Ooh-wee, you look so good
Won't you party wit me if you could
