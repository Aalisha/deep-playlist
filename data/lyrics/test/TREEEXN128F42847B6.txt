Brooklyn Brooklyn had to say it twice
Shoot the gift like a pair of dice
Nice on the microphone device
Only eat the black beans with the white rice
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
But your wack rhymes always make me sick
You're such a trick and I'm a nice treat
Can't tell you twice go take your seat
Just feel the heat that we generate
You can't compete we beat you out the gate
You're one day late and a dollar short
Now I'm gonna tell you all the things I bought
A golden blimp and a submarine
A laundromat and a club in Queens
Fannypack is Saks and you're a shop that pawns
But hey homegirl keep on
