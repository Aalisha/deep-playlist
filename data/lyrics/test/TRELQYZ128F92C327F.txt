Oh mum's the word but don't tell Dad
Like yeah I'm glad about the things I've had
Like Parking tickets and microwaves
Things that get me through the day
I'm like
Naaa man not looking for a fight like
Yeah Brother came out tonight like
Naaa but you look like you want it

When your feeling mashed up
Looking kinda washed up
Off to the (?) before he gets snogged up
Knockin' Back the class eyes
Talkin' bout the old days
...
