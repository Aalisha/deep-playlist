This time you've gone too far
who do you think you are
sharp words from soft red lips
scratch me with your fingertips
I've learned my lesson and I learned it will
to get to heaven got to go through hell
here I stand with my soul to sell
to you, yeah
Play with fire you'll end up burned
you think by now I should have learned
I said if you wanna someone else
then you can go yourself
I tried so hard but I can't say no
