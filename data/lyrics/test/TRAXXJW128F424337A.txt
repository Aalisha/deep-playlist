Unrelayed, bite right through
Curse the weight that strains your mind
Stationary, facing nothing
It devours you from inside

Realize you've spilt the essence
Boiling over, flesh melts fast
Liberate the key to vengeance

I'm not the one to steer this
My duties are fulfilled
Take the strain and struggle
