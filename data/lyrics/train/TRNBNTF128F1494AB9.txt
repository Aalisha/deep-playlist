Everything (Oh)
Oh... ooh... oh...
Everything
Oh... ooh... oh...

Let me stop and take some time to talk about
How you came into my life and turned it? round
When I met you, you knew I was all alone
Then you came into my heart and made it whole
(Made it whole)

Now everyday I get down on my knees and pray
(Yes, I do)
Already knowin' every word I'm gonna say
How you're keepin' me (How you're keepin' me)
You look after me (Lookin' after me)
How you're lovin' me (How you're lovin' me)
And I wanna thank you right now for

Everything that you've done (Yeah, yeah)
Everything that you've done
Everything that you've done for me
(You've done so much for me)
Everything that you've done
Everything that you've done
Everything that you've done for me
(Listen to what I say)

Now you know I thought that I could do it all
Only to end up with my back against a wall
Then you took me over to the other side
And now you carry me, I let you be my guide
(Be my guide)

Through my tests and trials
I know you'll be right there (Yes, I will)
I don't have to worry, I don't even have to care
Because you're keepin' me (? Cause you're keepin' me)
Lookin' after me (Lookin' after me)
