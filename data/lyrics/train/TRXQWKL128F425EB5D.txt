Oowah Oowah ah ah ah-ah Oowah Oowah ah

My old desk doesn't arabesque,
in the morning when I first arrive.
It's a pleasure to see its waiting there for me
to keep my hopes alive.
Such a comfort to know it's got no place to go,
it's always there.
It's the one thing I've got, a huge success,
my Good Old Desk.
