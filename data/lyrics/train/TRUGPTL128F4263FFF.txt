Stop your pretending
Listen to what I've got to say
How your head's went away
Only here for a day
And that grave I just made
Is for me when I get paid

Won't you wait a while
Move to the blue
Sometimes people don't want to say
Old time dancers don't die that way
See that grave I've just made
It's for me when I get paid

Somebody's gotta hold back the river
Somebody like you
