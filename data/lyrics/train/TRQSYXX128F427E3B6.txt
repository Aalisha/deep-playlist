Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
My woman done left and took all of the reasons
That I was workin' for

You better not try to stand in my way
When I'm walkin' out the door
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more

Well, I've been working in this factory
Pretty close to 15 years
I've seen some of my best friends women
Drownin' in a pool of tears

I've seen a lot of kinfolks dyin'
I had a lot of bills to pay
