Towards the rich archaic heavens
Towards the lack diorama
You are the artist and the texture
That plays with mantle of the earth

When the bleakest of powders
Lie rooted to the starched stones
And the roots that feed the peaking trees
embrace the sleeping stones

Archaic pearls of sleep and death
The voice of December losing its breath
...
