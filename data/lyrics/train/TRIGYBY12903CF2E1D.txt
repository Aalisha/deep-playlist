The stars are aligned, the moment has arrived
Holy light radiates
I feel it flowing, my power's returning
And slowly the air vibrates

Far beyond the stars
My mind travels
On a search for guidance
To a place where
It can grow and be
Completely free
I can't deny what I've learned
But it takes so much time
To understand the things
And to lay them out for the people to see

I've been there before
And each time I've acquired more
Life is a gift, priceless
...
