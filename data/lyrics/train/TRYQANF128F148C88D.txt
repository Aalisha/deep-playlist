What's up? Death on this kid who believes the mic
Blood on the soul so what that inside be like
A cross carrier with journeys upon self I
Efforts to ashes and hands to the sky

Child of light, child of light
Make solid the climb and let's see
Some new heights right, right
So am I trying to find life in what's been dead?
Yes, so recheck the mind set

Empower, can't slip
Can't slip, can't be slippin'
Empower, come alive
