I'M LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY
WHEN IT COMES TO FRIENDS AND LOVE
I'M LUCKY, OH SO LUCKY
WHEN IT COMES TO PUSH AND SHOVE

I can walk under ladders brave
No black cat ever crossed my trail
No kind of curse could get to me
Only good's gonna come my way

I was born in a video arcade
Graduated to a poolhall shark
Then I was off betting on horse races
Always been a winner, always been a star

I'M LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY
WHEN IT COMES TO FRIENDS AND LOVE
