She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do (I do)
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do I do)
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it aint you (aint you)
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just aint the way I do I do)

By the walk and the way I talk
What gave you the thought
The game many I loss
By thinkin' you false
Too many girls in the house
With heart strung out
Complain when they running they mouth
But they like me
Sayin just enough
I aint gotta ever do
Settling is takin' you home
I aint in it for the minute
No pass lives and gimmicks
Next time that ya see me
You'll see why the niggas love me

She might be the type to let you run all over her
But that's just not that way I do (I do)
Believe me if I let you get a sniff of the whiff
You gon' do things the way I do (I do)
Better see what the hits you give
Before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it aint you (aint you)
Only reason why I'm takin just what everybody give me
Cuz it just aint the way I do (I do)

Aint the way I do thangs
I do
