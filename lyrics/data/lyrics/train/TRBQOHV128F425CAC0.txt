In Hawaii there's a place known as Waimea Bay
Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
...
