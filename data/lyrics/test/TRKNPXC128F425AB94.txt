Just the way you walked, walked into my life
Then you walked right out, you were as cold as ice
How could you be mean, to treat me so unkind
Now I'm on my own, in a cold and lonely life

Wake up baby
Can't you see I'm half insane
Wake up baby
'Cause you know I'm not to blame
You know you're crazy to throw it all away
So won't you wake up baby
...
