I gotta ask myself,
What's it gon' be?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
I gotta ask myself,
What I'm gon' do?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?

I gotta pop up, pop up
Gotta get up every day
Something for me and my family
I gotta make decisions
And be somebody
I'm growin up as fast as I can
I gotta make some money
Don't wanna live by their rules

In and out the day
...
