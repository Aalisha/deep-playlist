(feat. Drake)

Welcome to the Future,
Blue Print 3
Ay count me in
Find me a nice soft place to land
I'm so high
Find me a place to land,
Yeah right there,

I'm so tomorrow,
The Audemars are yesterday,
Which means your on time delay,
So even if I slow it doooown,
My sound is fast forward, hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear this on my plane in my runway clothes,
Cashmere sweats they come out next year
But these my last year sweats,
And my hoe so sick, your new chick can't f-ck with my old b-tch,
And you know this sh-t,
I'm professional, they know this is,
I just may let you borrow this,
This the blueprint n-gga follow this,
This what what tomorrow is,
Welcome to tomorrow b—–tch,

[Chorus:]
