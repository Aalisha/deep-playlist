I never wake up 'til my shadow's longer than I am anymore
My cheeks are hollow as I feel

You're really gonna hate this
I still can dial your number in the dark
But whenever I pull
I'm pushing us further apart

I keep my fragments of you in a closet bottom bag
And I take them out and stitch them up

Caught in the open in the rained out parade of you

You're really gonna hate this
I still can dial your number in the dark
...
