We're running through the aisles
Of the churches still in style
Does this city have a curfew?
Don't you know it's good to see you too

The riders on the chan de lise
We are the tourists in the cafes
We drank our wine along the river
Not believing where we were at all

It's alright, the camera's talking
...
