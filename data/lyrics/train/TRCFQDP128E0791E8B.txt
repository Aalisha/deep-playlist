Mmm hmm, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, lady lady lady
Ohh ooh, can I talk to you?
Talk to you, listen to me
Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
I just gotta, gotta let you know
Can I tell you somethin'?
Baby baby, listen to me
Mmm, ohh

One time was enough for me
To realize what you mean to me
You stood by my side
When I was down
Didn't have a thing
You still came to see about me

I had many dreams
You encouraged me
You told me to keep pressin' on
Through it all
Without you, I wouldn't be
That's why I see, yeah

Where would I go?
What would I do?
Do without you?
I'm not complete
Unless you're with me

Where would I go?
What would I do?
Do without you?
I'm not complete
Unless you're with me
