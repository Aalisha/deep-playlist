If you should walk away
Take this broken heart
And if you walk away
You'll never know what's left behind
Go on and get away
Don't you leave a trace
And as you walk away
You can take most every...
Everything but my pride
Everything but the rings on my finger
Everything but my pride
I like the room this way
I like this bed unmade
We never laughed enough
But you laugh alone today
