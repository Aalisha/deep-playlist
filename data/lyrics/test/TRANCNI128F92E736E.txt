Sittin' here in my problem
What am I gonna do now?
Am I gonna make it?
Someway, somehow

Maybe I'm not supposed to know
Maybe I'm supposed to cry
And if nobody ever knows the way I feel
That will be all right, that will be okay

'Cause I'm gonna make this world a better place
I'm gonna keep that smile up on my face
I'm gonna teach myself how to understand
I'm gonna make myself a better man

Climbin' out the window
