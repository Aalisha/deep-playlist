Hey hey hey
I give him love, the best I can
But you don't seem to understand
It's not always deep but it's always true
And he does not belong to you

Hey, I do not forgive and I do not forget
I will fight for love until the death

Jezebel, save your charms
He'll be back here in my arms
Oh how quickly you forget
He's not yours yet
