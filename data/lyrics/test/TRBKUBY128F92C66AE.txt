With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the ground your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're never coming down

In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
