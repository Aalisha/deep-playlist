Just a few more days 'till spring
And I'm crossing my fingers
Oh let the snow melt into rain
The city is deserted
As if everybody hurt it
This town doesn't want us around here today
And I've got that feeling my life is caving in
I can't help but feel that way

So don't even tell me that all in good time
That I'll be just fine

I'd feel so much better if you'd loosen my tether
As I'm tossed about, your cold white ball
...
