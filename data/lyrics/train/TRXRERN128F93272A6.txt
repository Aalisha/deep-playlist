sometimes when he comes howe i'm cookin breakfast
i haven't slept a wink all night long
i've been layin bed thinkin like a woman
wonderin if my mans been doin me wrong
to think he might be out with another woman
makes my temper rise with jealousy
but all these years i've never caught him cheatin
i guess he needs some time away from me

but when he loves me he really loves me
