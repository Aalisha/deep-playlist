You don't tell me no stories
I don't wanna hear no lies
No reasons or excuses
None of your alibis

The phone rings I pick it up
Nobody's on the line
I know she's waiting for you
She's just biding her time

You'd have me believe
It's just a night out with your friends
But I know you're going back
To see her again
