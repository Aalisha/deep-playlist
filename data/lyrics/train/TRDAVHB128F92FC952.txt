When she called I had a knife to my wrist
Feelin like life ain't make sense
See I just quit my job
Sick of flippin burgers, and livin in my aunts garage
So I just let it drain
Sittin here drownin' in a bottle of Jim B
Thinkin to myself she was posed' to be my queen
Feel like a bad dream
And I just wanna wake up, walked in the house
Caught some niggas diggin her out, him and the spouse
Remember when we first confessed we loved on another
I was cool with her paps, she was tight with my mother
Crazy as it sounds, I think I still love her
Enough to take my own life, left me with nothin but a broken heart
Suicidal thoughts, a twelwe inch blade, real real sharp
Phone still ringin, so I picked up the call
Let go of the knife, let it drop to the floor
Damn
