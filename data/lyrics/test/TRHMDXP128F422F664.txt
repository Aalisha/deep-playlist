Shadows of irrational dread
Sensing worms in lust, blood eyed
The source of my cold existence
Forming, completing my dark side
Overwhelmed by self compassion
A symphony in chaos to no ones ears
The sound of laughter in suffering
And unmourning tears
My thoughts, without connection

Absorbed by a painless heat
Spreading through my swelling veins
Like million creatures trying to defeat
The organic structure of my human flesh

Orgasmic smell of blood, a new born beast
I have become, I have arrived to join this feast
Born a beast
