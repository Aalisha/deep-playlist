This scene is dead, but I'm still restless
An hour (? and our?) show until last call, i guess
I shouldn't even be here, much less
Drinking myself into excess

I'm not going home till I'm done

Well come on, we can't go on
Well come on, we can't go on
Well come on, you can't go home
The night is young
I'm blacking out
But it's been
Fun

Well everything's another excuse
...
