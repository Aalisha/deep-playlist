Seeing no justice in this world
You left me standing all alone
Can not deny that you amazed me
I'm still dazed and stumbling around
It's nothing to what's coming to you
Couldn't be more wrong thinking you could keep me for a fool
It was your choice to be so self-contained
Why should I feel sorry for you?
Your silent end is really a deception
Seeing no justice in this world
You left me standing all alone
Guess again
Held my breath for way too long
Guess again
Now I can't take it anymore
Guess again
I know it's hard to believe that what you see is real
Take another look and... guess again
Held my breath for way too long... guess again
Now I can't take anymore
Guess again
Held my breath for way too long
Guess again
Now I can't take it anymore
Guess again
I know it's hard to believe that what you see is real
