Old rockin' chair's got me
(Old rocking chair got you, father)
Cane by my side
(Your cane by your side)

Fetch me that gin, son
(I ain't got no gin, father)
'Fore I tan your hide
(You're gonna tan my hide)

Can't get from this cabin
(Cabin, joking follow)
Ain't go nowhere
(You ain't goin' nowhere?)

Just sittin' me here grabbin'
(Grabbin')
At the flies 'round my rockin' chair
(Rockin' chair)

Old dear aunt Harriet
(Aunt Harriet)
How long to Heaven she be?
(Heaven she be)
