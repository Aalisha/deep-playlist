I'll drain your blood
You'll taste my sword
You'll feel my wraith through this knife
I'll take your life
The hole in your head
Exposes lust
You never covered your sin
You cant kill me

I'll hang your coprse before me
I'll stand and watch you burn
I'll hang your corpse before me
I'll hang your corpes before the world
