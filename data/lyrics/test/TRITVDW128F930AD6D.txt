Domes of crystal, spires of light reach out
Symbols of attainment once aspired
A quest for knowledge fuelled by love of peace
People never burned by fired of war
The people of the East
Grew tired of peace
Now mistrust and fear
Are new to us here
Storm clouds gather
Mistrust turns to hate
A confrontation none could forsee
Machines of peace melt down for tools of war
One thousand years of peace destroyed
The people of the West
Though war they detest
Had nowhere to run
So the killing began
Three score and four years
