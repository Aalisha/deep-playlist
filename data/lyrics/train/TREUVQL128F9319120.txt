In perfect rhythm marching
One beat uniting all these hearts
We stand for something somewhere
My strength and pride control my thoughts
I always thought the worst of almost everything I do
I never want to end up so fucking jaded like you

But you'll never break me down
You just rip me from the core
I take what goes and comes around
It always leave me wanting more

I stand in line behind you
I breathe and live a silent dream
That I'll fall out of step
