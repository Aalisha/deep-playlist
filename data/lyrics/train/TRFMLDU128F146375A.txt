So after all you never kid yourself alone.
See you standing senile ever overblown.
I knew a chance of changing back would re-appear again.
But I can jump right over you say when.
Tell me driver I can't seem to understand,
Better be the leader than to hold the major's hand.
Looking forward I can see a happy tree;
A normal unaffected family.
