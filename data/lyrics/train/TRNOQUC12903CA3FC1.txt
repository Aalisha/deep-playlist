The crowd is here, the stage is set,
The fire starts to burn
All are ready for a final rage
Feel the Metal-Atmosphere
Ready to attack
Now it's time for us to go on stage

Guitars screaming loud in the air
The magic, the power is there
And the moonlight is shining on me
Raise your swords in the air for Majesty
