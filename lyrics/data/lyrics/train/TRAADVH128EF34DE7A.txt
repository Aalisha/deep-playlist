Well if you don't like it
Go ahead, find yourself a saint
go ahead now,
Try to find a boy
who's gonna be what I ain't
now what you need is
A plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always acts so quaint
Said yeah yeah yeah

With your new friend
You're really making a scene
And I see you bouncing around
From machine to machine
And you know
They're never real, they're
Never what they seem
And you can try to generate some warmth
And you see just what I mean
I said yeah yeah yeah

And If I'm acting like a king
Well that's cause I'm a human being
and if I want too many things
don't you know that
I'm a human being
and if I've got to dream
baby baby baby yeah
I'm a human being
and when it gets a bit obscene
(wooah) I'm a human being

And I've just got to go around
