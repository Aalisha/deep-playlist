Castle stands on the island of stone.
It is surrounded by dark waters.
Centuries on it's place,
For centuries more it shall do the same.
Its history so cruel,
The fort was cursed by eerie doom.
There's a witch enclosed into the wall,
No one knows exact place where.
There's a tree on the wall,
More than thirty feet tall.
It is said its roots
Grew from the heart of sorceress.
Every night she haunts
On the corridors of fort.
Her restless soul
Wanders in those huge halls...
Autumn long time ago,
...
