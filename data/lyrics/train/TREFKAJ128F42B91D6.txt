Don't solve the problem,
when danger is better.
Far away where you stock them
In cages that tether

And all the bridges you've burned,
leave you trapped off at all sides.
And now the tables do turn,
and it's all gone, what's left for you.

And when the sky is falling,
don't look outside the window.
Step back and hear I'm calling.
Give up, don't take the fast road.
It's just your doubt that binds you.
Just drop those thoughts behind you now.
Change your mind.
You let go too soon.

Sit down, you're sinking,
there's no one to watch you.
Skip town, you're thinking,
