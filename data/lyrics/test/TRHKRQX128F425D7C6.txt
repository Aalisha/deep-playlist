Dance with me pretty boy tonight,
Dance with me and we'll be all right,
There's a whole floor before us,
Just for you and me,
So follow my lead and we'll 1, 2, 3,
Pull shapes!

I like to disco,
I like to rock 'n' roll,
Well, I like to hip hop,
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop
Pull shapes!

I lead with my left hand,
I stomp with my right foot,
Well, I just wanna freak out,
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about.

Dance with me pretty boy tonight,
Dance with me and we'll be all right,
...
