(We got love)

'cause you've got ONE lucky fella TWO love you true
And I got THREE little words I'm sayin' with FOUR only you
FIVE o'clock I call you and by SIX we got a date
SEVEN I'll be heaven-bound and in your arms by EIGHT

Everybody now (We got love)
By the numbers (We got love)
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (ain't it wonderful we got love.)
