She's a girl who likes her living
Never tired of always giving
Faceless men pay for the pleasure
And the nights go on and on

Walking the street
For a handful of money
Love don't come cheap
With a heart of gold

She's indiscreet
But to me, girl, it's funny
They pay for the love of a girl
With a pure heart of gold

She ain't hungry for a lover
When it's over, there's another
Loneliness won't be a problem
When the nights go on and on
...
