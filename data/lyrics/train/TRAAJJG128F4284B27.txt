I hear you cryin' for me
But I see the anger in your eyes
I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze
The light is slowly fading into the black
...
