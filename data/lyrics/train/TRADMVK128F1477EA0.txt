Hear the crack of a bullet down on seventh avenue tonight
Man lies bleeding on the floor
Hear the cry of the cop car as the streets are filled with blue and white
They all rush into the clinic door

And Iâ€™m never gonna know how you ever get to sleep at night
And justify the things you do
With your hand on the Bible, you say you killed a killing man
Well mister what does that make you?
