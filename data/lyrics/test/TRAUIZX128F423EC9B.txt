Sitting in my armchair
Thinking again and again and again
Going round in a circle
I, I can't get out

Then I look around
Thinking day and night and day
Then you look around

And the tension
And the tension builds
And the tension
And the tension builds

Take advantage
Let nothing be fantasy
How do you grow
As you stunt your growth?

Nothing you say
