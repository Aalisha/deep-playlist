I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home

I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone,
and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home

I'm reading your note over again
And there's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
I will love you always and forever

Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
...
