Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles

You're taking too much time to make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't
And all the other girls in your crazy mixed up world
You said you'd drop them, but you know you won't

Sometimes I think about forgetting you
But it's so, so hard to make that choice
'Cuz boy with you, I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles, goin' round in circles
Circles, goin' round in circles
