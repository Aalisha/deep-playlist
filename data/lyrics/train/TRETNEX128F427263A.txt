I brought you something close to me,
Left for something you see though your here.
You haunt my dreams
There's nothing to do but believe,
Just believe.
Just breathe.

Another day
Just believe
Another day
Just breathe
Another day
Just believe
Another day
Just breathe
Iâ€™m used to it by now
Another day
