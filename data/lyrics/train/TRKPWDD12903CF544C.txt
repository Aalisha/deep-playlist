Baby, baby, baby
Remember how we laughed?
There was a time we knew how to live it up
And I couldnt totally give it up, no, no, no...

Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe you were blind
Or maybe you finally, finally lost your mind
Or maybe you just needed to unwind

I loved you baby, dont you know
But I almost missed the show
Waiting for your love to grow
Watching the December snow

I Know Better, I Know Better not to lean on you in any way
Youre a distant memory... nothing to do with today
...
