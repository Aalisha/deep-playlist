You come from England to play for us
Tell us the truth
But all you do is disillusion us
We can't be heard
Upstarts against the world like us
Everyday's another clash
Preach silly rules to us
When all you want is cash

Treachery from the old world
Treachery you've been bought and sold
Treachery is all you hold
When you've nothing to prove
Oo-ee-oo
We don't need you
