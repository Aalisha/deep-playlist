I can tell that you're used to dealing with
Chicken heads who have no kind of class
They're unable to keep your mind intrigued
From moving to fast

What need is someone who can provide
You a challenge that's keeping you alive
100 percent woman, yes indeed you say
That's what you need, so I'm thinking

Since I'm who you want
And need in your life
Then we should do
Lunch or dinner sometime

I can see that you're full of confidence
...
