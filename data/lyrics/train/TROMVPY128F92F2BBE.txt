Like your feelings and the seasons
Everything can change
Life's Chamelion without reason
Gives and takes away
We are drifters, all together
In a world of castaways	
Undercurrents overcome us 
Or were swept out with the waves

Take me away, my world is drowning me
Now that I know myself I finally see

The ever changing tide 
Has turned around again
Takes me for a ride
To the ocean's end
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on

It ain't easy being lonesome 
...
