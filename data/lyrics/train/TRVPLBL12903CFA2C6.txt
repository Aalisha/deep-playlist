It's that ole devil called love again,
Gets behind me and keeps giving me the shove again,
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams,
And rocks in my heart.

It's that sly ole son of a gun again,
He keeps telling me, I'm the lucky one again.
But I still have that rain, still have those tears,
And those rocks in my heart.
