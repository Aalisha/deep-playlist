Many come together, put your hand on me.
Not feelin mama, and then a blind man sees.
Been sleep walkin', then he turns to me.
OH YEAH

I'm workin' on a new thing, workin' on a sunday mornin', 
Were gonna be forgiven, of that hard livin'

This steam rollin', heading for a crack, 
Cruise controller blowing rigt on past.
Sleep walkin', put your hand on me.
OHHH
