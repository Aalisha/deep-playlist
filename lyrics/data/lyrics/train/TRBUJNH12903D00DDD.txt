She keeps the world at bay
With walls built to stand come what may
And with that coldness on display they held until today
She would hold her own
Running all alone
Ridding her road of every grain to stay in control

But now
She cries
ALIVE

Suddenly she is down on all four
And the walls will support her no more
Cries her eyes out like never before
Onto this LINOLEUM
The bottled up and stored

She's won every war
And when she's out that door
She will push ahead of you
Frowning at the poor
She would move so fast
Not to end up last
Aiming for the finish line
...
