I look into a sea of blue in your eyes
And see a full and swollen moon
Resplendent in a stormy sky
I look through your gaze; it's source is pure and uncorrupted
And see a wilderness of dunes; untouched, uninterrupted

Pessimism protects me;
Limp hope won't let me down
.still I lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around
I swear, I won't unravel this time
I won't, I won't unravel this time
