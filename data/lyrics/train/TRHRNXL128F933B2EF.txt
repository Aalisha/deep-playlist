Here I go once again.
I´ve learned my lesson.
I almost broke my neck
And you´re about to bring me down.
I´m starring at my shoes
Without expression.
One more time you´re the king
Who has just stolen my crown.

All I can see
Is just a wannabe
Whose insecurity
Is trying to kill me.
Behind your fucking mask,
A little jerk whose only task
Is to bring others down,
That´s all you are...
That´s all you are...

The winner takes it all.
Congratulations!
So, I gotta take the fall
And you´re surprised that I don´t mind.
Before I saw the things
Right with your eyes,
So full of desperate lies,
I would rather be blind.

All I can see
Is just a wannabe
...
