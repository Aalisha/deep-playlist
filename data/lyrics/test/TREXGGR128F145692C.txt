Well all the things I've said
To try to make it work
Have all been bent or misunderstood
Everything was taken the wrong way
Now you're making things so hard

Now when you think of me
You get bent outta shape
Pissed off at all the choices that you've made
Everything is going the wrong way
And it's making things so hard

You always kick and scream so hard
What can I do to calm you down
Why do you make things so hard
