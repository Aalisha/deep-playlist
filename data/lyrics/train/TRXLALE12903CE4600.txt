I must confess
I more or less
Have played your last request
I took a trip
Aboard your ship
Well, now we're back, I guess

When I let you tempt me
Did I think my tank was empty
Or just running low?
Don't know
One too many pieces missing
Had to learn how not to listen
Now I know

I've finally come around
Dancing on my own ground again
All that I'd lost I found
Dancing on my own ground again
And I'm all right
