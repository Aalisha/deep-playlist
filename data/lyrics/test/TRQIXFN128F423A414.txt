[Intro:]
Aight, so look (No)
I know you think everything I say (Yeah)
I jus' be talkin' (Oh)
It's alotta B.S, I know (We keep, we keep, we keep, we keep yeah, oh)
But we gotta stop goin' (Oh, we keep, we keep, we keep, we keep yeah)
Back and forth, back and forth
Up and down, up and down
Round, round, round and round
If it's up to me
I'll make it happen

[Chorus:]
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to lock you down (Time to lock you down)
And I'm givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
Only wantin' you to be around
Baby, we be goin' round, and round and round
It's time to settle down
Givin' up them girls
On other sides of town
And justify this love that I found
We be goin' round, and round and round

[Verse 1:]
If a tornado swept through towns
We'd be goin' round and round
So many years that we stayed down
You sound like no other sound (No)
If I described my heart right now
Gotta turn my love side down
I'm on my knees, 'fronta of you right now
And I wanna make you mine

[Pre-Chorus:]
Where will this road lead us right now
...
