Everyone's got secrets
dirty little secrets
Have i got one on you
(Have i got one on you)
Although they may be secrets,
they may show your weakness
Well are they really true
(well are they really true)

Don't tell your mates
on the council estates
cos there's no one to trust
Don't tell the sky as it spits down in your eye
but tell the priest if you must

cos everyone's got problems
everyone's got problems
...
