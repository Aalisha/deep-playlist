Back, back, back with the boom, so give a nigga room
Came with the fame with my name came a tune
The King of Rock, there is none higher
God?? with Madonna not melodic like Mariah,
Carey, when Larry put me in his Caddy I made my album
I rock the funky beat like Marky Mark be rockin Calvin,
Klein's, no friend of mine, I told you Pryor,
Richard, switch it all around now you admire
"My Adidas" was a hit in eighty-six it made me dollars
Stompin straight through Compton niggaz there was screamin, "HOLLIS!"
Back to the top, you're bout to get dropped
Go for what you know or ride the bo' and get stopped
My man Darryl Mack, dressed in all black
I pass the mic to D (and D.M.C.'ll pass it back)
