Girls with lion faces string me up like a guitar.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm imprisoned inside a billboard.
All I eat is thongs.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

The streets are empty.
Everyone's missing.
The streets are empty.
Everyone's a ghost.
Cheerleaders eaten alive by synthesizer beasts.
Cold civilization can't wash the blood off of its teeth.

There's skin growing over my eyes.
Haven't seen the sun in 66 years.
The sky is such a disgraceful mess.
We sleep all day.
