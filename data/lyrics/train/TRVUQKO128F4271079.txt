Baby your deal is surreal just like lightning, streakin' on
Heaven still is a state of mind, where did we go wrong?
What happen to those old convictions
Went up in smoke
Baby, while your back breaks slowly
By the skin of your teeth
You'll be under their thumb

Moving from this state of friction
We all got stars in our eyes
But you know by now your one restriction
Is at the edge of the sky

Keep shining like a new star
Shining like a new star
Baby we better start
'cause baby we're alive
New star
