Gimme a break, a 2nd chance for heaven's sake
Director's cut, alternate take and I
Won't mess up any lines, you'll see
I want a happy end to this movie
I'm not a fan, anymore of tragedy

Where I just walk away
I'll find someone else
And I'll tell myself
I'll remain content for all my life which
I can guess that, I'll contend that it won't be long
