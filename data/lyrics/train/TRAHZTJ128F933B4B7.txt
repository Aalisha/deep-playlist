It was in the merry month of June, 
from our home we started 
Left old Eireann’s Isle, 
to Poland we departed 

Hope within our hearts. 
We can win a trophy 
We’re a part of Trapattoni’s army, 

Get behind the team, 
hear the Irish scream, 
C’mon you boys in green, 
Ireland’s bouncing back again, 

We have got our Trap, 
the cat is in the sack!
We’ll not forget you Jack,
on the Rocky Road to Poland 

One, two, three, four, five 
Irish eyes are smiling 
Let your voices ring, 
...
