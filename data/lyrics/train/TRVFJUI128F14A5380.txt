There ain't no good in our goodby-in'
True love takes a lot of tryin' oh I'm cryin'

Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl we've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on hang on hang on
To what we've got

You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
(breakin up) I wish you'd never said it
(breakin up) No no we'll both regret it

That little chip of diamond on your hand
...
