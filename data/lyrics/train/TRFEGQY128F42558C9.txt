All you boys and girls
All you sluts and whores
You're a dagger in my heart

I had you near
And I had you far
But the one I can't get now
She's a dagger in my heart

Thinking of you, thinking of you
Thinking of you is a dagger in my heart
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Thinking of you is a dagger in my heart
