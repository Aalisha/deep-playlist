Civil wars over the world, powerful unions interfere
It's a dangerous situation for us all
Atomic bombs are ready to be launched
It's time we unite, it's time we scan the universe
We had to move on

We seek colony 5

We have the technology for destruction
Can we use that knowledge to survive?
Reverse the process and make something great
Our calling is not to die
We have to find a way to survive
