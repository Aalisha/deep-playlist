Wrap your innocence around you

When the sun stes in this ageless sky
I'll wipe your tears, kiss them dry
And as I kneel beside your bed and sing you to your sleep
I pray to God, your hopes I'll keep
While your gently sleeping, peaceful dreaming
I pray that nothing ever haunts you, baby

Wrap your innocence around you
