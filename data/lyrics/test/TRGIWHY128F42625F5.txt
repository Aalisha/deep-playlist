Running from yourself left you stranded
And now you're exactly where you never thought you would be
In the dark without a light to guide you
What once was a breath is now a gasp to survive

You left so much behind, so many questions unanswered
The other side, the crash to the burn
The fingers that picket for your solid satisfaction
Belong to the hands wrapped around your neck so tight

You live today without a care, tomorrow will come and I'll still be here
I gave myself to you and you left me with lies
And there will come a time when you have so much but there's so little that you can touch
And still I consider you a friend
