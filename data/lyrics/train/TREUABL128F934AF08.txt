(Reale)

Passion and pleasure, It's always the same
Playin' with fire, it's a dangerous game
Turn back the lies, turn back the night
It's deep within me, a spell I can't fight

And you burn, in me
Just like fire on the ragging sea
Like a storm, from inside
Like thunder from a friendly sky

There's no escaping, that look in your eyes
