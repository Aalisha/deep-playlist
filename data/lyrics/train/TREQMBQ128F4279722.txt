The wiggedy-wicked
Les starts to rip shit
Beatnuts makin crazy noise with some hip shit
24-track, e.q.-ed to attack
Pump mo' watts than any Radio Shack
Black, I stick to bein ruff and rugged
Anti-pop, I guess I'll stay broke (Fuck it!)
A crazy hispanic, Psycho Les panic
Nah, not me, I just pull the automatic
Out the knapsack, and cold point it
Blast ya, and leave your punk-ass disjointed
Yo, I ain't goin out like a punk
Nothin but fat rhymes and beats for your trunk to pump
I make you wanna jump like Kris Kross
(Beatnuts gonna blow up!) Slow down on that Crazy Horse
My hand's tied from the mic it holdes
I'ma jet up the block before the record shop closes

V.I.C., droppin styles you ain't used to
Nice with the lyrics, when I produce I get looser
Beats I got plenty, they come a dime a dozen
