Hey ho hey!
Its the acid test.
Got a busy day, I'm wearing a vest

Hey ho hey
Try not to get bent
Got a busy day, I'm wearing a vest

Hey hey
It's all in a day
Hey hey
It's all in a day

The armor ten, and the I95
Tupuolo Joe honey and his rhumba jive.
The look came out, and life broke out
'It must be a hex'
I swear the ---- loaded right on the desk
Hey, let's go do this

Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood

Oh hey hey
Its all in a day
Well hey hey
Its all in a day
Oh hey hey (in Sherwood Forest we had Robin Hood)
