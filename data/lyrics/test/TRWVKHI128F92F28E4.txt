Sent from heaven
Sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last as strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh, no more will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven (ooh, 'cause)
I wanna be the one who you believe
...
