And in the dark it comes for me
Malevolent and without thought
Uprooting trees, destroying cars
Cold and relentless, with arms outstretched
No boat nor brick
Nor crucifix can hold it back

I've been wicked
I've been arrogant

And when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)
And when it comes it will feel like a kiss
And I cannot say that I was not warned or was misled
When it comes it will feel like a kiss
...
