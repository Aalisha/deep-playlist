Standin' in the street, shaved, I'm washed and neat
And the time is mine
But I don't even know where I'm goin'
Been too long in town, just workin' right tied down
But I've got my pay
And I'm willin' to spend all I'm earnin'
Maybe over town, where the say love can be found anytime of day
I'll be lookin' you know I've been wishin'
...
