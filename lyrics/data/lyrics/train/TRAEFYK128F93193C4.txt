Trying to tell you what you can or can't do
Why should anyone know better
You know you must find your own way to go
No-one else there to pave it
Trying to please and just keep of harm's way
You won't ever make the distance
Across the storms on life's sea
If you don't lift your sails

Need no hindsight
Need no magic
