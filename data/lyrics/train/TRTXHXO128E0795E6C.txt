Turn the lights low and put some music on
Let our bodies sing swing to the soft song
I feel ya heat, it's turning me on
I wanna feel ya all night long

So come close, as close as you can
I surrender, you're so tender and tanned
I wanna toss, I wanna tumble, feel and fumble
I wanna do it till my belly rumbles

So lay back and close your eyes and
While I fiddle you can fantasize
Yeah, while I fiddle you can fantasize

You gon' deep, baby
(Deep, deep down)
Like sleep, sugar
(So rest upon my chest)
You gon' deep, baby
(Deep, deep down)
Like sleep, sugar
(So rest upon my chest)

You gon' deep, baby
(Deep, deep down)
Like sleep, sugar
(So rest upon my chest)
You gon' deep, baby
(Deep, deep down)
Like sleep, sugar

What ya body wants, I got dis
Whatcha need indeed, I'm gonna rock this
I dream, you scream and tighten ya hold
I tiggle in the middle as we giggle in I go

Oh, deep and down deeper like an ocean
As I push I blow ya emotions
