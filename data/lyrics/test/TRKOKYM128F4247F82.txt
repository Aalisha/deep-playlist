Oh yeah, let me tell you now, oh

Gotta tell you girl what's been on my mind
Been such a big influence, influence in my life
I know you called on me and I said I had no time
I was frontin' on you I must've been blind

Come over her my dear
Gotta get close to your ear
'Cause I wanna make it clear
That all my fears are gone

I'm ready for the thangs
(That you've been talkin' 'bout)
I'm ready, won't you shine?
(And remove my clouds)
I'm ready for a place
(Safe to park my heart)
'Cause loneliness now in the world is off the charts

I'm ready for the way
(You wanna rub my back)
I'm ready for what happens
(After in the sack)
I'm ready to quit playin'
('Cause I've had enough)
I'm ready for this boy and girl to rise in love

Playa playa man, I was in my zone
In my freaky world, anything was on
But when I met you girl you were like a mirror
Only you made me see, things deeper and much clearer

About the man inside
