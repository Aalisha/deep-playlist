No I don't want to love you
cause I know how you are
thats why I have been staying away from you
thats why I haven't called ya
cause I know you could possess my body
I know you can make me scrawl
I know you can have me shaking
I know you could have me climbing the walls
thats why I don't want to love you
cause I know how you are
sure you say your right on and your righteous
but with me I know you'd be right off
you know I could possess your body too?
Dont cha?
You know I could make you crawl
and just as hard as I fall for you
