Were you dying to go?
You just looked so exposed,
Demure through the dark dancing lights.
I glided by.
I can't deny
That the shadows betrayed you and I
On that night.

Oh, I must confess I am overdressed.
Are you not impressed?
Darling I want to.
I'll confess this too, must you know the truth,
This is all for you.
Darling, I want to destroy you.
