Little girl don't be sad and lonely
Don't forget you're the one and only
Close your eyes
Stop your lips from shaking
Don't look back, alright
Just be angry all the timen
Looking out from a new daylight
Get rid of this bump
Get rid of the grind
Looking up from a new way back from loneliness
No one said it would be like this
You're feeling lost and naked
But you know you can make it right
By me, by you, by anythingn
Little girl don't be sad and lonely
Don't forget you're the one and only
Close your eyes
Stop your lips from shaking
