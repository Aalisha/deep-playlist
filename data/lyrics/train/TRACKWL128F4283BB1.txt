It's the fallin' in love
that's making me high
it's the being in love that make me cry, cry, cry

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause...

Bridge
No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
...
