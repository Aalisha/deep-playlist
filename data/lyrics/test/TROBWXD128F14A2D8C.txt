Even if you turn away
Sweep it all aside under the rug
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
But your problems still remain

If you're living in denial

When I look into your eyes
I see something inside of you
That was once inside of me

And I've been there before
I've nearly lost my wife, my friends and more
