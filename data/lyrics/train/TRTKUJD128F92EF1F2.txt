[Verse:]
My true love - the only one for me
And the other there will never be
My true love - always there for me
When I'm feeling so lonely
My true love calls my name
That's when I go running
My true love will never let me down
Please don't let me down

[Chorus:]
The more that I see you
The more that I need you
This feeling just won't go away

I can't live without you
I won't ever doubt you
