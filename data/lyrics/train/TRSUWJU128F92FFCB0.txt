Tired and lonely still we stand
On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days, my engine's stalling
(Road to nowhere)
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent, hear no sound as I wait forever

Salren, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
Cause it tore us apart, right from the start
I miss you

Feelings that filled me left me cold
...
