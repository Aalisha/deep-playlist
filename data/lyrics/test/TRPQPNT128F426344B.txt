I've sailed the seas, a hard sea dog to please.
Tattooed on my chest, is the girl I love best.
Back in 1954, on leave in old Singapore
I was soaking in gin, when Miss Foxy walked in.

She's my Singapore silk torpedo,
Wearing high satin non stick lip glow,
I fell a victim to this female hipno,
She's my Singapore silk torpedo.

She drives a Mercedes, she's queen of the ladies,
My China seas sweetheart, she tears me apart.
