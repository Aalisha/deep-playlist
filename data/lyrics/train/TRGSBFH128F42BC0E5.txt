Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
I don't want to lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
