As I walk in a room filled with gloom
I don't know what to do
(Suddenly)
Suddenly, my life has changed
As another one's been taken
(Is it so?)
I find myself in a daze
As the sorrow grows
(Sorrow grows)
Tomorrow I lay alone wandering, wondering
(I lay alone)
Wondering how come?
What if?
And why?

Please give them words of comfort
