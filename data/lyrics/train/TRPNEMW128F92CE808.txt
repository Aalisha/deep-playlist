Now just because I have you
You don't have to break your back to pay me back
Now, I don't give just to receive
I was taught at a Sunday school at the age of three

Now don't be ashamed, if you need me call my name
Has it ever occurred to you, that's what friends are for

If you can go to your friend
Then why don't you let your friend come to you
You know that I got two and you got one
I'm not talking about the way it seems but the way it's done
