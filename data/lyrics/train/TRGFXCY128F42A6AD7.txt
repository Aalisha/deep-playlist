Feelin' like I want some more
Feelin' like I want some more
Feelin' like I want some more
Feelin' like I want some more

Feelin' like I want some of your love
Feelin' like I want some more

You got me open like a liquor store
Love's so strong that I don't want no more
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug, girl, you got me hooked

You're the queen I see in my dreams
Wanna taste some of your ice cream
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug, girl, you got me hooked

My boy's say I'm trippin' but I'm like so
'Cause you got me open, I don't care who knows
When it comes to you, baby, anythin' goes
You're just like that drug that they smoke

You got my mind twisted an' all tied up
From your conversation an' gentle touch
What ever you want, baby, never too much
Baby, sit back an' let me take a puff

You got me open like a liquor store
Love's so strong that I don't want no more
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug, girl, you got me hooked

You're the queen I see in my dreams
Wanna taste some of your ice cream
I can't describe the way you got me shook
You're like a drug, girl, you got me hooked
