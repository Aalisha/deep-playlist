We had fun in the sun
But now you've thrown it away
Tossing out the baby with the bathtub
These dogs have strayed
You'll never know how hard I tried
To keep my worries in line
But they're all bastards

Gone are the good old days
Of painting young Courtney Pine
Listened to the taunts and the shouts
Of celebration wine
I never could make it work out right
Her milk glows in the blacklight

But it don't matter
Because no one comes out to see us
...
