Take you home

Baby, I know your wondering
Why I won't, go over to your place
'cause I'm not to sure, 'bout, how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
and I know, and you know
that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something, that I'll regret the next day
And, end up hurt... Oh I dont know
 'bout the way I feel, the way that I feel
I'm so affraid of, a one night, deal
I, wonder if I take you home, will you tell me a lie baby
Because I need you tonight
 I, wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby
Because I neeed you tonight... ho-ohh

Your love is.... 

(take you home...)
Lately, you've been expressing to me
Just how much you, want to make love
I want it, just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say that's teasin', but I do have a reason
 Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me
And sooner than you know it
...
