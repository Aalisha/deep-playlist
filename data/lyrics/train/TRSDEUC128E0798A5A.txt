We have everything we need here
We have everything between us
You have nothing left to fear, dear
'Cause it ain't ever gonna leave us

We might get a room downtown, now
Get away for a half day
We might drive a car down to the next town
Get away from our family

Let your body move real slow
Tell your body we left yesterday
