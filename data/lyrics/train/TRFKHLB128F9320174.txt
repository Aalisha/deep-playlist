Hey folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red-hot hoocie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Hidehidehidehi (Hidehidehidehi)
Hodehodehodeho (Hodehodehodeho)
Hedehedehedehe (Hedehedehedehe)
Hidehidehideho (Hidehidehideho)


She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
and showed her how to kick the gong around
