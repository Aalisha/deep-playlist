Michael Michael Michael
Wake up we're going back to chelmsley wood
Michael Michael Michael
My feet are dancing can you see them
Michael Michael Michael
I'll change my hair but inside I'll stay the same
Michael Michael Michael
I'll draw my lips around my lipstick

My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much

Ah see if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that change then let go
