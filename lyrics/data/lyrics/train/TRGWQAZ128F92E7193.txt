(Dolly Parton)

I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me 
The road that led me out of his life 
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder 
The day that I told him good-bye 

I never should'a left him 
Never should'a gone 
Oh what a crazy fool I've been 

Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
And will he take me back again 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
...
