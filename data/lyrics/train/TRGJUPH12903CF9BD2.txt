There is a place that has no name
No sound of laughter, no children playing
It's not on the map but it's there just the same
The places that built the toys for the nuclear game

Sascha digs the food in the snow
It fills the gaps where his pension don't go
He spent his life making weapons of war
Times have changed
They don't need him no more
Beat the drum
Beat the drum

Since Joseph built his iron wall
And America raced for the moon
We wasted our breath, on the science of death
It was what we were told we must do
A lethal quest to show who's best
What on Earth did it prove?
I don't know

Beat the drum
Like an army
You've got the voice
So state your choice
Beat the drum
Beat it loudly
...
