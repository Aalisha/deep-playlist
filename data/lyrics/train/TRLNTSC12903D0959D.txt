Tell me if I'm good enough
Then tell me if you're strong enough
Tell me if I'm to late
To make up for my mistakes

I have said this before
But it means so much more to me
This time has been on my side till now
I can't believe I let it get this bad
Well, don't you want something better?

And I'm going crazy
Losing you has faded me
