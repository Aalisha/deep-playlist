Millworker houses lined up in a row
Another southern sunday's morning glow
Beneath the steeple all the people had begun
Shaking hands with the man who grips the gospel gun

While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground
Fills up the morning air, ain't nothing sweeter around 

I can almost hear my mama pray
Oh Lord forgive us when we doubt
Another sacred sunday in the south, alright

A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
