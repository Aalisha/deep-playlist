I was six years old when I fell down on Spencer Avenue
It was my Aunt, Suzy's house, and I still can see the bruise
I remember Grand Daddy and even though I never sat on his knee
He taught me life is culture, baby

My Uncle David, they call him Jello, the only man that could say hello
And it sound like angels singing in your ears
And even though they all passed away, I still long for their company
And I wonder God, why couldn't they stay

So I gotta remember, though I'm young
That my time will surely come
And now I gotta try to keep it together
As I watch my family pass me by

So remember, so remember, so remember
So remember, so remember, so remember
So remember, remember, remember
So remember, so remember, so remember your family

I was twelve years old when my Uncle Andrew had got sick
And jaundice turn to HIV and then his body quit
It was strange the numbness I felt, watching him all dressed in black
Wasn't thinking about what he gave up but about all that I lacked
