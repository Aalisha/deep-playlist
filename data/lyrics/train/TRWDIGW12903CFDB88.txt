I'm a crusader for justice
I'm an innovator for life and it's my mission that you trust this
I know I'm spittin' it right, reach out and touch this
put your hands up while I spill my guts, bitch! x2

I roll up in the spot with million dollar thought
a zillion dollar knotch and I'm feeling ballers watch
first they look at her, then they look at me
but that's when they get get stuck like some F-A-G's
I keep walking, they creep stalking, overhear 'em talking
they still hawking, head nodding in disapproval
they hella mad, how can I get what they don't have
but the answer to that is rather brutal, it's a??
now who will get to reign? the tougher or the sane?
the richer or the slicker? Most answers are a shame
I'm cancer in the game of a faker
I take their little hookups and turn 'em into something major
I wanna put your wager up for what's gonna pop. POP-POP!
when the lock gets knocked off and everyone get talking
bust shots off, you're really not that special
but neither are you less than the next so go on and flex ya muscle

I'm a crusader for justice
I'm an innovator for life and it's my mission that you trust this
