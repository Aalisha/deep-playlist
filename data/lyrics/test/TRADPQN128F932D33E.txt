Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
