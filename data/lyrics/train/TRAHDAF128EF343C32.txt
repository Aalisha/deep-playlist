Chorus
I've been waiting all night long
Just for you to come back home
And I've tried to close my eyes
Tried to forget all your lies

Tell me, did I get you wrong
When you said our love is strong
Now it's time to make up your mind
Tell me
Where did you sleep last night

Verse 1
Gave you all of my money
Gave you all of my time
Really loved makin' love to you honey
Was just too blind to see the sign
