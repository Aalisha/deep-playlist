They used to think it was so cute when she said Dy'er Mak'er
All the boys knew it was a joke about Jamaica
She'd always find a ride back home from the bar

She used to feel so stupid when they'd talk about the music
Born into every single tune
They used to hum against her lips with their hands on her hips
They used to kiss in the car

Dancing days, houses of the holy
Hot child in the city in the middle of the prairie
Flirting with the boys with all her charms

First the laugh, then the eyes
Then the touch him on the arms
Then the drinks, they never seemed to cost money
Saturday night was a runway that extended into Sunday
And sometimes Monday

Back then it was beautiful
