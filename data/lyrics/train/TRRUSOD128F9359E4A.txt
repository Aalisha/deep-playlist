Beautiful, ah ah ah...
Beautiful, ah ah ah...

I'm losing my way in this night,
walking away from the light.
Surrender will be my escape.
Breaking the walls of my mind,
I'm one step ahead of the truth.
I hear what I want to hear and I hear you.

And if I lie with you long enough,
I can see the things I'm dreaming of.
Let's go through the ritual
until everything is beautiful.

Beautiful...
Beautiful...
...
