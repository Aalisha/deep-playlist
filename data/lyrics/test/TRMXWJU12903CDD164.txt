I know there's a man who can sell time
I can take it away and say that it's mine
He smiles from a distance and lives in a tree
Holding out a welcome hand, a fist for you and me

Money is chocolate, locked in a silver cloud
Everybody knows but no one is around
There's no tomorrow, only today
When it rains, it rains lemonade
