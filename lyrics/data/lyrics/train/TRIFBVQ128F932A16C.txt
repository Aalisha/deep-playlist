Well This heart of mine
Has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time
To get back what is gone

But I'm movin' on
And you don't hold my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, and I will curse your name, hey!

...
Well, I heard the news
That you were back in town
And just passin' through

To claim your lost and found
But I'm over you
And there ain't nothin' there
That you could say or do

To take what you did back
...
