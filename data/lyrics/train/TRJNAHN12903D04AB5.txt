It's tough for me to make a move
And I know what I gotta do
Cause I got everything to prove
I got a plan I'm sticking to

The word is that Iâ€™m over doubt
But I don't let it get me down
I ain't nobody's push around
If they could only see me now

There's only one thing on my mind
And I am running out of time
I'm coming girls, so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gunna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

I'm gunna lay it on the line
