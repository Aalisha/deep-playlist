Just as I am without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

The service is nearing an end
As they are singing, 'Just As I Am',
And now as the old song is played
People at the altar
Are kneeling down to pray
Some are finding mercy
Forgiveness for their sin
Some are fighting battles
And they're struggling to win
The time has come

To give them to the Lord
That's what the altar is for

"That's what this altar is for
You don't have to carry
Those burdens anymore
There's a light in the darkness
...
