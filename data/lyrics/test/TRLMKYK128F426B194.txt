Killing's my business and business is fine
money's my interest, life isn't kind
you know you can run but there's nowhere to hide
payback's a bitch boy
now you're gonna die
hand me the contract, i've got no remorse
the more cash i get, the bloodier the worst
you claimed their way out, life is up in flames
how 'bout doin' it my way
beheaded or slain
Hanging or lethal injection
gas chamber - take a last breath
firing squad, electrocute, we'll execute!
more than one face of death
...
