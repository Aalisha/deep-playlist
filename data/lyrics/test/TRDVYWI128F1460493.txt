How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?

Had a dream I could turn back time
Had to stop to rewind my memory
Had a vision of the ruby sky
We were riding high on our own pink elephant

Another day in this fucked up life
Another struggle just to get through nine to five
Maybe it was only ego talking
But I always thought we were innocent

How are you?
How are you?
