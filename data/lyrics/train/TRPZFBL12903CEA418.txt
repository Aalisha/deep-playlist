Chorus:
Well, it's hard to love and not be loved
It's hard to please your mind
When you've broken the heart of many a poor boy
But you'll never break this heart of mine

Can't you see that lonesome ship that sails
That sails from shore to shore
If I was on that lonesome ship
I'd sail away no more
...
