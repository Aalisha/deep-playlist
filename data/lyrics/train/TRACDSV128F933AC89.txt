Feel so good - it must be wrong
this junk is really workin' out pretty strong
feel so high, it must be low
move so fast, it's almost slow

gonna hit you so hard, you'll never hit back
child you look so spoiled it makes me sad
you act so weird, I think you're clean
you treat me so tough, it's almost mean
...
