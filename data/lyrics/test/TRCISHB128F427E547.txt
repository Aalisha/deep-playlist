Don't go away
I'm trying the best I can
It's not easy to get out of this
It reminds me every minute I breathe

It was going so well for us
Maybe a little too much of parties
Every time I needed a little bit more,
and who's to blame me for that

The beer felt too soft,
the booze was welcomed by my throat
And ever since it has been more and more
It's the most important thing for me
...
