Absu
Miscellaneous
...And Shineth Unto The Cold Cometh...

[Lyrical Magick: Proscriptor, Voice: Proscriptor, Bass: Equitant]
[1st Verse]
Laughter from Esharra is convincing, but unclaimed.
The last of Ka drifts across the river
- Our sky outside has not been named.
Two Ugalla-demons start their battle
- Tempest of the creek is floored in flames.
Winds of Imhullu foretold their weather
- Sea-dwelling floods reply without names.
Taste the salty tides of the Apzu
- Alight seven tablets wearing steel of lame.
Laughter from Esharra is convincing, but unclaimed.
[Chorus]
6000 years past away to let the Utu tribes hear the lying words against
Azzta's truth.
