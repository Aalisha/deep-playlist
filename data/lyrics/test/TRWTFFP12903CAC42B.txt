I lie in bed but I can't sleep
On the ledge but I can't leap
Even doing nothing is so hard to do, to do

On my tongue but I can't speak
The simple things just are sometimes deep
I only hope that this means something to you, to you

I want to spend my life with you right by my side
'Cause when you kiss my lips I see the lighting in the sky

That's like one step forward and two steps back
'Cause love is like a hurricane
When you're with me I'm on track
We're riding on a crazy train
I'll be fine if you're mine at the end of the line
