Lets overload

I can hear your heels clicking on the sidewalk
Beating to the rhythm of my heart
Caught up in you
You're the only one I want
I follow You home every night
Just to make sure that You get there alright
Baby it's true
Can't think of anything but You

And what I need baby
It a little bit of sympathy

You got me on me knees
