Images of everyone, of what you see just illusions of,
What we were meant to become,
Awakened fire of the Son inside,

Everything within me cries out,
The phoenix is rising,
My heart overflows,
Everything within has burned out,
The fire is rising,
New life has begun;

And I'll never forget, just who You are,
Cut Your name inside of my heart,
Touching the flame right, where You are,
Can you feel the phoenix rising?
