Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh

Life's a tangled web
Of cell phone calls and hashtags " I don't know"
You are so caught up
And now the blinking lights and diall tones
I admit I've been a victim of the worldwide system too
But I've found my sweet escape when I'm alone with you

Tune out the static sound of the city that never sleeps
Here in the moment on the dark side of the screen

I like the sound of the rain
I like the sounds you make
We put the world away
We get so disconnected
You are my getaway
You are my favourite place
We put the world away
Yeah we're so disconnected

Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh
We're so disconnected
Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh
