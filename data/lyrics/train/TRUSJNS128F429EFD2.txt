I'm a band in a show about a man holding hands with his wife
On a therapist's couch, with his face to the ground after fucking around countless nights
And there's this one episode, close-up cameras are showing him crying
His red head and his red eyes

I'm a band in a show about a boy being buried alive
From his head to his toes, by a criminal, but with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes
And there's this scene in the show when a hustler knows he's gonna die
The ground opens and he climbs inside

And as he speaks his last line, a thought falls from his mind, and I pick it up right through the TV
Oh, oh
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene?
