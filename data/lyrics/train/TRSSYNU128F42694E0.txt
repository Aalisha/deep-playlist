I will break into your thoughts
With what's written on my heart
I will
BREAK!!
BREAK!!

I'm so sick,
Infected with where I live
Let me live without this
Empty bliss,
Selfishness
I'm so sick
I'm so sick

If you want more of this
We can push out, sell out, die out
So you'll shut up
And stay sleeping
...
