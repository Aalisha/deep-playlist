Love and hope and trust today
Is what i think i'd like to say
Can you see me standing here?
Can you help me with my fears?
Is there a way to come to you?
Live forever, just we two

Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
I'll be there

Don't ever give up your dreams
And all good things will come to thee
Don't give up your ever hope
Life is laughing
Can you cope?

Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
Live in sunshine
...
