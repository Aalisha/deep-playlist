I'm going away to be alone, I'm coming back with answers
Don't try to call my telephone, It's disconnected
And I don't know where I'm going, But can you guide me?
If I find love where I'm going, Will it survive me?
â€˜Cause in your own space, you're disconnected
And in your own mind, You're not affected
And in your own time, You're still attracted
But in your own life

This Heart Attack
I've gotta get away not coming back
I want some downtime
So call me when you can and I'll be fine

I've found the time to be alone, I don't know what to ask you
I'm waiting by the telephone, And you're still barking
My heart stops it isn't - going could you revive me
I think I'm lost without knowing, So come and find me
...
