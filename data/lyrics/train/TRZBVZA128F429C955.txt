I've got a question.
I've got a question.

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!

[Mr. Lif]
How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
and you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
of a sniper's shaky scared, shot of your ear
All fucked up now! one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pops
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
