Feels like heaven when I think about you
Sparking that love within my soul
And when I touch you, I can't describe it
Sending chills down my bones

With God as my witness and watching over
We'll write our love in the stone
Please give us strength, Lord, to fight our battles
And we can walk on the streets of gold

? Cause you take me higher than I've ever, ever known
Give me good feeling like a king and queen on a throne
? Cause you take me higher, further than the sky above
Send me in ecstasy, baby, with your love

Tell me what you're thinking of, must thinking of love
Put your hands into mine and then we'll take off to the sky above
Soft like an angel, like the feathers laying on a dove
