I didn't always feel this strong
Light on the water and my song
Time and place where I belong

I didn't always feel so clear
As in the moment I appear
Beauty seems so real this year
And don't you know that

L, O, V, Easy when you
B, E... Y, O, U, for me
C, H, A, N, G, E will set you free
It's true
...
