If it was up to my pride, I'd be gone
If it was up to my mind, I'd be moving on
If it was up to my shoes
I'd be layin' rubber on the street
Anywhere else, that's where I'd be

And ain't it just my luck
When every other part of me gets unstuck
You'd already be gone if it was up to me
But my heart's got a memory
My heart's got a memory
