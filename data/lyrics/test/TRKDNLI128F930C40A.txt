You
A faun in twilight
Immaculate perfection

I
A god in half-light
A hero in a play

Pale blue scenery
Fleeting moments passing by
Dots and anagrams
In the sands of time and the wind

Us
A monument of sand to
Defy the odds

Us
A rampart made of dreams
That would not last

So tired without you
The sultry heat of summers gone
...
