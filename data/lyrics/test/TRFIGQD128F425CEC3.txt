There's a notion between us my love
A notion of powder and dust
Somehow I was blind,
but now I can see

As you walk through this world Rosalie
Every step is one closer to me
As love we will find,
what the others can't see
Your letters in mind,
I love you Rosalie

Let the world spin you closer to me
take a chance on us Rosalie
As love we begun
to find a world that is free

I want to dance with you Rosalie
I want to dance with you Rosalie,
to the new years' just time,
to bring you closer to me
The whispers are mine,
...
