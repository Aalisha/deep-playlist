Paul:
You're working to hard
Too many hours on the job
And you know it must get better than this
You're killing yourself
And missing your love
It's been weeks since you've been with your friends

We all need to change once in a while
The time to make a change is right now...

Chorus:
This is for the good times, good times
This is for the good life
This is for the good times, good times
This is for the good life
...
