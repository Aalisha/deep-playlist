[Instrumental 24 secs]

I don't trust the government
I don't trust alternatives
It's not that I'm paranoid
It's just thats the way it is

Everyday I hear a little scream inside
Everyday I find it's getting louder
I just want to reach out and touch someone
'Cause I find I need a friend in this dark hour

We the people are getting tired of your lies
We the people now believe that it's time
We're demanding our rights to the answers
We elect a precedent to a state of mind
