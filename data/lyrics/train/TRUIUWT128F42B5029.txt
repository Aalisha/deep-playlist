Midnight sky shining on my face
I feel the waves embracing me
I'm here to find some peace of mind
Time and tide it waits for me
It waits for me, yeah

So here I am again somewhere in between
(Hate to Love)
Trying to find reality in a dream
(Hate to love)
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
(Hate to love)
oooooohhhhhuuohoh hate to love
