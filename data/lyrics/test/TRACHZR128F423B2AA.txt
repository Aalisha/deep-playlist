Sometimes when I'm driving in my car
I wish that you would take the wheel
But you're not there, Its so unfair
What if I hit that dog again?

Sometimes when I'm lying in my bed
I let those voices in my head
Influence me, to some degree
Now I'm not sure of anything

I wish you knew what I was thinking of
They told me to breathe, They told me to lie down
I figured it out, you're one in a million
'Cause I'm writing the words down
I figure my chances are one in a million
I dont know why, and I dont know where to begin
