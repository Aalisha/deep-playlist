Won't fight this growing fever
Ask myself how much I really need her
Put all my trust in liquor I just can not help but always bicker

Anticipation
A growing desperation
Retaliation
Leave me a light on

Can't stop anticipating
Ask myself how long I've been here waiting
Time spent I'm going nowhere
Don't know if I can keep sinking lower

Anticipation
A growing desperation
Retaliation
Leave me a light on
