You know, I've always believed
That when you feel somethin'
Especially somethin' good for someone
You shouldn't keep it from them
You should let him know
But I also believe that
If you think it's love
There's really no need to bring it up
If you know there's no chance for it to grow
But it seems like
I'm always coming up with contradictions
Because now I find that
What I believe and what I feel
Are two very different things
And those feelings I've kept all to myself
Are gonna come out now
Even though they've changed
So you see
I guess I was right in one way
That I never told you this
