A city full of people and my favorite is that waitress
And she treats me like some kind of common vagrant
I see her every day, but there's nothing to say
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe

I only get to sit if I buy something to eat
Otherwise its best to keep my feet moving down that street
And goddamn, she's a hard bitch
She talks at like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage

Yeah I know that the toilet is for customers
You ain't gotta tangle up the strings that make this puppet work
It doesn't have to be a game of paddy-cake
But it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway

And by the way, I can see it in your eyes
You're angry with your life, not a stranger to the fight
I bet you hate every man that you date
And you're probably addicted to all types of escape
