I don't need a heartache
And crushes can be so fake
Sooner than you know it
They turn your world around

You might think I'm crazy
When I don't want red roses, yea
I'd rather have you promise
To never let me down

I don't wanna fall in love
I try and try, but then we get emotional
Oh I don't need a hit and run
Don't tell me we were only having fun

Kinda like your sweet talk
And that could make a good start
...
