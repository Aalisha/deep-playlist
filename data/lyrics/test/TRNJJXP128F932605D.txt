Do we fight to hold our heads up high,
And beat the drum to what we love?

Risk the fall, oh we have felt it all,
come crashing down from far above.

Stars arising, countless worlds colliding,
only one will take it all.

Can we bring to fall the giants,
Can we make the final call.

We are the ones,
To ignite the darkened skies.

The champions,
Of a world that we defy.

A solemn reign,
Of the few who rise up high.
