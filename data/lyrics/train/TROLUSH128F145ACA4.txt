(Paul Davis)

Another love, just another love,
I don't wanna be just another love,
On your list of hearts, you've torn apart,
Then you've cast them aside.
Oh, can't you see, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be just another love in your life.

Well, I hear you've got a reputation in town,
For takin' all the young girls an' breakin' them down.
You're givin' me an invitation to stay,
But boy, you know, my heart says I oughtta be runnin' away.
Well, I've never been hurt, so I guess it's my turn,
I'm gonna see how strong I am.
