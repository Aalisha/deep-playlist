I'm in bloom, I go vroom
I go right off without my little parachute
Made me strain, did her part
Put a perfect summer solstice on my heart
And it's a start, and it's a start, and it's a start

I don't know why, she's got something in her eyes
Friendly la-foe, just like Clara Bow... be
My only one, be my only one
Dream in my mind, one of a kind
Cause she's so really keen

Set my sail, for her charm
...
