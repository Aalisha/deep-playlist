I was a sucka for you
So crazy in love with you
But I'll be damned if I do
Nothing else you want me to do
Cause I got played for the fool
And you know that wasn't cool
You made it harder for the brothas
Cause of you, I just don't trust em

I thought it was all good
Me and you sayin that you my boo
Never knew that you was doin the do
With every girl givin out hoochie coo
But now I find
And it just blows my mind
That every time
I said that you were mine
They were laughin behind my back and
When I found out I was so sad

Then I said, hold up, wait a minute
Slow down, turn around
Are you really gonna let that bull-shhh go down
