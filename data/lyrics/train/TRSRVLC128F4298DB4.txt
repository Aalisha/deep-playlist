I couldn't do it
So I asked for helping hand
To get me through it
But I guess it wasn't in your plan

Or maybe you were
Just too busy to make time for me
I always put you first
Expected me to figure out things
But they all kept getting worse
When I think about the way you let me down
I wonder if I'm supposed to count on you
How could you ignore me?

My imaginary friend
Didn't come through in the end
So now I have to find a real one
Didn't answer when I called
Well, I guess it's just because
He was never there at all

I can't believe it
