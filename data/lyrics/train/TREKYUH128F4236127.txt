I want to know where
my confidence went
one day it all disappeared
and I'm lying in a hotel room
miles away
voices next door in my ear

Daytime's a drag
nighttime's worse
hope that I can get home soon
but the half-finished bottles of inspiration
lie like ghosts in my room

I wanna go
I know I can't stay
but I don't want to run
feeling this way
til I am myself
til I am myself
til I am myself again
There's a seat on the corner
...
