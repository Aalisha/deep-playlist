Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate

Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta g-g-gangsta, g-g-gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate
Gangsta, gangsta, weak niggaz perpetrate

I grab my swatter I swat this bug, he laid to rest
Fuckin' wit T-R-I-P-L, E-S-I-X
Niggaz be talkin' but in the end I like fuck 'em up
In the beginnin' they could've survived but they had no nuts
Bitch where you graduated from, I said a school of hoe-in'
'Cause in yo face, off in the streets aint nothin' but hoe is showin'
Too fuckin' light, too fuckin' light to try to fight
Stick you with knives, shoot you with - nines and take yo life

Yea we know you niggaz are fuckin' scared 'cause we don't play around
Never wanna step 'cause Three 6 Mafia put you in the ground
People say you buck but we all know that's just that liquor bro
Niggaz swear you hype but all that hyper is from hittin' that snow
If a member call me then I'm gonna pack my yawks and roll
Ride down on yo block and close up shop and leave yo body cold
Foo this ain't no game so tuck ya chain and coward hide yo grill
High cappin' and dissin' in yo rappin' just might get ya killed

They don't fuck wit you like ya fucked with them
Yo pockets tore down from limb to limb
