In the rain
I'm walking slowly
there's a light
in your apartment
and I don't know why
I ache for you

and it's alright if you're undecided or,
if you're scared that you might like it or
if it's true, I ache for you

there's no rhyme and there's no reason
you're the secret in the back of my skull
there's no logic, so please believe me
our love's confusing, but it never gets dull

it's getting late
anticipation
and if we talk
...
