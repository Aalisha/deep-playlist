Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
We'll drink and dance
There's no place else to go
We'll stay out all night long
We'll toast the break of dawn
Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show

Well they rolled one for the road
Put on the same dirty ol' clothes
Down the trail they rode
To the Motel Cowboy Show
Well they parked at the end of the line
Underneath the cold beer sign
It's a long long way to ride
Without your whiskey and your wine
Something stronger would be fine
Something stronger would be fine

I said Hey Ol' Lady lets go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
We'll drink and dance
There's no place else to go
We'll hang out all night long
We'll toast the break of dawn
Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
