Hey redeemer
Now what's become of me
taken in by promise
awakening in grief

Collecting us like puppets
you instrumentalize
A frigid trepidation
in a million puppet eyes

God gave his word just to let us down
Where is he now?

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land
