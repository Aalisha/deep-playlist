When your live is? an all haze?, that you never get through
Do you long for the days when you knew what to do? 
When your mind is in deep freeze but your heart is on track
When you see what you want, do you ever look back? 
Just put your thoughts away, so never mind how it seems
'Cause everybody's afraid, everybody has times when life splits at the seams
And I've been trying hard to face what I've become
So I can live and breathe the love inside these arms
...
