Smoky old bars, bright neon lights
Good ole boys and girls of the night
An ice cold beer and a good shot of brandy
I've always had a sweet tooth
For the devil's candy

And I've fought it all my life
And the battle's now a war
But I'll get up tomorrow
And I'll fight it all once more
I want to do what's right
But I'll never understand me
...
