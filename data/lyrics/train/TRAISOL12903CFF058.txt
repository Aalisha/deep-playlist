Late one night I was fixin' to fight
A dirty hustler tryin' to cop my $$$
When from behind a whiskey bottle
Cracked me then I hit the floor
Barely alive I could feel him drive
A black needle in to draw my blood
With an evil grin he sang a mojo hymn
And left me face down in the mud
Dark angel gonna get me
Lord, set me free

I've been cursed by a voodoo hand
Black magic all around
Oh mama, pray for my soul
I'm dying on this killing ground
Cursed by a voodoo hand
Death's needle pushing down
Oh mama, pray for my soul
