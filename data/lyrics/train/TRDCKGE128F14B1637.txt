At least we had the sense to know what's done is done
Now I'm not saying we never had fun
We made love like a speeding train but we'd end up back on earth again
It oughtta've been easy when we got together
Sign all the papers, and on with forever
No real reason to drink a lot
Well wake up honey, see what we've got

Oh my I remember this we don't have any wedding bliss
Wake up there's some things we gotta set right
Sixteen bottles and a wedding trunk
Oughtta be a law against marrying drunk
Honey, we got married again last night

You always told me we should follow our own minds
But that was you staying out late and me always left behind
Fussin' and fightin' about the same old stuff
