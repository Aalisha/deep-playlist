Want more real attention.
At my expense guess you forgot to mention.
You talk good,
I'll eat glass.
I heard you read my mind behind my back.
Outside, I'm waitin'
by the car when you're hesitatin'.
Take a good look.
Take a photo.
Write about it in your tiny notebook.

Don't you know? You're out cold.
Don't you know? It's our dance-floor!
T.K.O. Hear it on the radio.
T.K.O. Play it on the stereo.
T.K.O. Watch a live video.
T.K.O.
T.K.O-O
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
