Turn this thing around
Turn this thing around
Turn this thing around
Let me go back to where we were

Help me to decide
Help me to realize
Help me to get by
I'm gonna be on my way tonight

You left me baby
What you wanted to go for?
You sent out all the wrong vibes
We carried on but it wouldn't get better
You said that I was just alright

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind at all
You said this was a trial separation
Maybe I was just so blind, yeah

Turn this thing around
Turn this thing around
