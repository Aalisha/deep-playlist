Now to understand the struggle, to understand payin' dues
And the pain of my people and your people all around the globe
You gotta feel me, listen to music, use it

What you know about juggling jobs
And struggling hard and chasing dreams?
What you know about havin' no car
Rent bein' due and no bling bling?

What you know about sacrificing
All your wants for all your needs?
What you know about lovin' your child
Just to find out that ain't your seed?

Until you know my joy, know my pain and know my struggles
Until you've walked these shoes, paid my dues and felt my troubles
Until you've shed my tears, known my fears in all my years
Only 'til then, you only know what you think you know

What you know about hittin' that block
And dodging them cops to make ends meet?
What you know about the lights bein' off
The gas bein' off and no food to eat?

What you know about goodwill clothes
While your friends dressed fly in junior high?
