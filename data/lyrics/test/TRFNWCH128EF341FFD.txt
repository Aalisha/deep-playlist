1st verse
I know myself and the shit that I do
It seems my mouth keeps on bothering you
I'll make my excuses, I'll apologise
Everybody changes when the music's right

Chorus
Turn up the beats and join me on the dance floor (dance floor)
Rip off the sheets and you'll get what you ask for (ask for)
If you recognise me in the morning, don't tell me what I can't recall
What's that, flashback, are you ready for more?
