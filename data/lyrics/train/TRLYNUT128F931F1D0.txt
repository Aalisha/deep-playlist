If you only knew the pain
The pain I keep inside
The pain that makes me "me"
Then without it who am I
In a room with broken walls
I lay in scene and dreams
I want you to see

I'm cold and white
I'm holding on
I'll try to breathe for you
I'm crying out
I'm singing loud
You could be all I need

And I'm losing my will
Just to hold you in
...
