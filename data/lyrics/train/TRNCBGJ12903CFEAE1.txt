look inside do i like what i see
there's gotta be more to this
there's gotta be more to this
i keep searching for a place of solace
out of the dark into the light
oh god god please please can you help me
searching for shelter
god's little helper
help make it better for me
piece of mind i desire
i vow to never tire
something's gotta give
