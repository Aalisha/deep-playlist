(VERSE 1)

(uh huh)

I keep my hip on pound
Cause shit gets hectic in my town
Drag my family with me cause that's how real niggas get down (gea)
If it wasn't for 50 I probably wouldn't be around (gea)
Caught up in the temptation sitting in jail or in the ground (gea)
If for that if you snap a finger and I'll lay a nigga down (whoo)
It's fucked up when you're only facial expression is a frown (uh huh)
A hood rat will put a future in a fool's pants
Till she find out you can't buy furniture with food stamps (uh huh)
A year ago I made a decision before I shut my eyelids
pray to god i don't get shot tomorrow cause I don't like surprises
When you hot as an oven they ain't brace you with open arms
When you cold as a freezer niggas treat you like they don't need ya
Some people call it? me I call it amnesia
Live my life principal driven never bite to have that feed ya (uh)
Never mind all the haters fuck'em all let them die slow
All I need is my niggas, money, liquor and hydro (I kno)

(CHORUS x2)

Everybody gon' die one day
Whether it's natural cause it's a gunplay
