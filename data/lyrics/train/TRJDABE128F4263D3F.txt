Walkin' on my own,
Absolutely free,
Solitary life,
The only life for me,
Midnight cafâ€š,
Dinner alone,
Independent heart,
Is all I've ever known,

Oh I believe,
I had no one to lose,
and nobody fooled but me

Fire in the storm,
Rainbow in the night,
Lightning on the sea,
Heaven in your eyes,
Never before,
The magic of night,
It happened in my arms,
Right before my eyes
...
