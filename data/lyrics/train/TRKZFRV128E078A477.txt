Drink down that gin and kerosene
And come, spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me be

I keep my jealousy close, 'cause, it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy
Then I'm not the only one lying

Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
...
