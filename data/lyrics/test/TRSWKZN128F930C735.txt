pushing into every corner yes we do
climbing walls and running lights we´re leaving you
buy your cars and clean your homes we´ll see you there
your an ocean and the salt air
don´t want nothing but the callousness I had
and I´m trying all I can to get it back
on the bridge and its not such a long way down
sorry officer we´re just fooling around
you´ve been drinking
you´ve been driving
crashed your car
said a prayer
get outside (?)
and he´s not there
pushing into every corner yes we do
...
