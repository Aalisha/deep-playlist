Each moment's just a reflex
Response is just a motion
The pressure never ends baby
I hope it don't drive me crazy
I don't wanna be a poor boy
It don't help to say gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I ain't foolin' myself now
All I know is what I feel

I know I don't like it
You can't disagree
Come on, say it'll be alright
I say yeah, yeah, yeah

Future tense, gone too far
Future tense, a world apart
Future tense, more than a feeling in my heart
Oh yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
