Some say that you may soon be leaving town
Do you tire of chasing all the women around
Will you never be contented with your life?
Will you always be the one who won't think twice?

When you go down on your knees, you're so hard to please
When you go down on your knees
You're so hard, down on mission street

God only knows how you can hurt her
