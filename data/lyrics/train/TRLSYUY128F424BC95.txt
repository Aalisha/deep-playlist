Hello, go ahead man
Yeah, I'd just like to say
Let's have some music now, huh
OK

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

The only time I feel alright
The only time I feel alright
The only time I feel alright
Is by your side

The only time I feel alright
The only time I feel alright
The only time I feel alright
Is by your side

Iâ€™m not content to be with you in the daytime
(Ooh)
Girl I want to be with you all of the time
I believe that you and me last forever
