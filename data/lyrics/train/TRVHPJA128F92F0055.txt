Speaking:
One thing I want to assure them,
if they think I'm gonna change or compromise
my attitude and my way of life or
in my expression or in my goal
what's politics
they are making me stronger
and i am much much stronger now.

Check a blank to the boogie
and up chuck a boogie
to the rhythym of the boogie to be x2

there it go like simple the plainness
the prominent bassness
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
fly gold, radiating from heaven to pavement
if only years of placement with nothing to play with

spent time hating but that ain't changing it
God give it to me no body ain't savin' it
therefore, moving on the base in stammerment?
standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
the walls is trembling, the air is simmering
she movin' like more than the airs is glistenin'
woah now
testin' your equilibrium
soudning fate booming all over your eminence
skin on skin again
put it all, get it all, get in then
ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
... or entrants and simil men
there it is, boogieman
...
