In Earnest
Words & Music: Andy Tillson

I. The Radio Amateur

Keying his mic' as he searches for life,
A gentle old man sits alone in the dark,
He's scanning the waves,
Looking for memories he can share.

His correspondents collect him like stamps,
Adding his callsign to their trophies and maps,
And none of them wonder just who it is they're talking to,
None of them think to ask the kind of man he was...

"I was a pilot, in a war long ago
and it all seemed to matter way back then..."

And now and then he feels the ground-rush,
As his plane hits the air,
Or feels his ground crew rally round him once again.


II. Worthy of Memory part 1

He remembers everything about flying Spitfires, sending Morse,
The crackle of the radio, the tension of the news reports,
He flew to save his people!
His people do not want to know him now.

He remembers every detail about those sand-bagged days,
But every chapter that came after, vanishes in blurry haze,
He has no great love story, just medals and a glory, gone for good.
He gave his youth - just like he should.
