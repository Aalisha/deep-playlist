La da da da... ohh ohhhh!
I want you baby.
Tell me...
I wanna know if you want me baby (baby)
Tell me, babe
Tell me (girl)...
Do you feel the need for love
(come closer babe)
Everynight i just dream, about you,
I try to hold myself together,
But there's so much that i,
I wanna do.
Being with you everyday
Is so beautiful,
That's why i want you to let me know...
Do you want me?
I wanna know if you want me baby (baby).
Tell me babe...
Do you need me?
Do you feel the need for love?
