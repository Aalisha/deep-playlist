Train run buy, my back door
Whistle blown little after fall
When blues fallin' down like rain

I can't eat, i can't sleep
Late at night i hear my guitar wheep
Oh baby
When blues fallin' down like rain

I never meant to let you go
God knows i love you so
I never meant to do you wrong
Before i knew it baby, oh baby
You was gone
