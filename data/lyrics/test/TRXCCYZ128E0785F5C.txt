All alone and Im feeling wanted

Try to wait but my bodys calling, youre the one so why dont
you come and rescue me,
Ill be here while you on your way, counting down till I see your face,
hurry up cause I love the way you rescue me.
Now yourre here, come on out, the rain soaking wet
body glistening, finally we could do something so rescue me,
Cant believe how its going down,
Im so obsessed with this love I found it got my head spinning
round and round just rescue me.
All night long Take me away to another place,
rescue me save me, save me save me all night long
Take me away to another place rescue me
