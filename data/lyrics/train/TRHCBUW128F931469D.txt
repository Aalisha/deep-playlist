I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
These ain't rain clouds over my head
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed
Just can't seem to get ahead in life
Ooh, nothin' I do ever turn out right
Won't somebody help me please
'Cause I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
