Where are the people that accuse me?
The ones who beat me down and abuse me
They hide, just out of sight
Can't face me in the light
They'll return, but I'll be stronger

God i want to dream again
Take me where I've never been
I want to go there
This time I'm not scared
Now I am unbreakable
It's unmistakable
No one can touch me
Nothing can stop me

Sometimes it's hard to just keep going
But faith is moving without knowing
