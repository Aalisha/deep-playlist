Motivated right about now
Yeah that's right

Five bro five
The track on five

Let mi tell it to you one time
You violate mi even one time
I only pull the trigger one time
Slug kiss only one time
You see the pictures all at one time
Soliders lace dem I buss them one time
Girl if I give to me one time
It's forsure you'll be back more than one time

Just know your fuckin' with a city boy
And know dem city boys keep alotta toys
Like AK'S SK'S Eagles and loins
Keep me feelin' like the world is mine yeah
I'm at the table just dying for xxxx to pop off
So I can run in da safe and snatch the lock of
I got something dat will run through your vest
And leave a baseball hole in your chest
So fuck with me

And mamma rise me as a solider
Born bread a solider
Live die a solider
And you can say I never told yah but
The way they kill these snichtes for free
Who me I plegde a ligents to the hood
Cause police and politians mean us no good
So light it up if your ready to fly
Real soliders ain't afraid to die
Smoke with me
