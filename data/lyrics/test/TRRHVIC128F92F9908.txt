I'm not calling you a liar, 
just don't lie to me
I'm not calling you a thief, 
just don't steal from me
I'm not calling you a ghost, 
just stop haunting me
And I love you so much, 
I'm gonna let you kill me

There's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks with my legs
