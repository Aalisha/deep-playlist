Where 69 meets 40
There's a single stoplight town
And back when I was really young
Part of that burned down

On any given Friday night
We'd drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the grocery store
Laughin' all the while

With as many friends as I could pack
In my daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house

I'd rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
