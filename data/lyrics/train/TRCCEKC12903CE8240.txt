(Chorus)
Take 'em away, take 'em away Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken cause my spirits
Not free
Lord take away these chains from me

Some birds feathers are too bright to
Be caged
I know I'm not that colorful but a bird
Just the same
Open up your gate now, let me put
Down my load
So I can feel at ease and go back to my
Home

(Chorus)

Sun beating down, my legs can't seem
To stand
...
