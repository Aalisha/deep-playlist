Locked inside your head
Do you realize the things you said
Never made sense?

We can sit here and laugh
But we don't know the half of it
In your defense

We've been talking a while
And it seems to me each time you smile
Lights are coming on

But they don't burn too strong
And they won't stay for long
And then they're gone again
