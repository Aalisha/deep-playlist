It's Xmas morning
The snow is falling silently from the purple sky
Little Tim is waiting for the evening
When Santa will bring those presents

But more than presents he'd wish for peace
He'd wish for safety and understanding
That there would be no more fights
That there would be no more fear
It's Xmas morning
