Ever since we happened on a glance in Khyber's Caf√©
I will always thank God for the chance He gave us that day
Pleasant conversation on a break, a break from the band
You were then and have always been a perfect gentleman

You love me
Nobody else would do it
You hear me
Nobody else would listen
You see me
Nobody else would notice
I'm special in your life
