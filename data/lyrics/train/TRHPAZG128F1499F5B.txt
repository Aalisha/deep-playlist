Completely into you
Discreetly, I will prove
That I can do
What you need me to, for you, for you

I gotta come clean with you, baby
Do anything to make you see

Let's not waste any time
Baby, just give me a chance
We could make some sweet romance tonight

Completely into you
Discreetly, I will prove
That I can do
What you need me to, for you, for you

And now that you are here with me
