Multifarious carnage
Meretriciously internecine
Sublime enmangling steelbath
Of escheated atrocities

Enigmatic longanimity
Of ruminant mass graves
Meritorious victory
Into body-bags now scraped

Regnant fleshpiles
The dead regorged
Oscularoty majestic wrath
This carnal forge

Desentisised to perspicuous horror
Dehumanized fresh cannon fodder
...
