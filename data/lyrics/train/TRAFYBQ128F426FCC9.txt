Come to me again
It's been to long since we had touched like this
So we jump right in
It's like caving it up again
When i'm with you baby

I don't care if you got somebody else at home
I don't care how might say that it ain't right
This is our only change to be alone
Honey you can be he's forever
But you gotta be mine tonight

Just love me down
From head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go
Just love me down
Nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more
...
