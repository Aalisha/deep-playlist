Eyes are meeting with mine across a room
And they send out special signals
There can be no mistake what they mean
I know, the better you look the more you see
Youd better look before you leap

Eyes like yours always looking for outlines
Eyes like mine always looking for yours
Eyes like yours always looking for outlines
Eyes like mine always looking for yours

Perspex princesses are dancing in their rooms
There wearing slim-back shoes and theve got nothing to loose
But the lurid day glow dreams of me and you
...
