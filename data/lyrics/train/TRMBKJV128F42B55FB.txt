4. Water for the Wicked 4: 23
(Robben FordÂ­Michael McDonald)

All the misguided people
Have no place to rest
Given to their misdeeds
And driven from their best
And breakin' in to the midnight hour
A fire is in their breast

Water for the wicked
Water for the wicked
Just a drop to cool his tongue
...
