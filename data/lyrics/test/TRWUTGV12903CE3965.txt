I used to be like the tide
Wondering lonely as a cloud
Will there be another time
Watching the candels drown

I miss the perfume of your soul
All the things you never told
You never invited me here
Into you secret world

It sounds like a clich√©
But I can't say 'I love you'

I'm setting the silver sail
I hoped I won't fail
I'm drowing in the sea of love

I'm sailing the seven seas
The ways all increase
I'm drowing in the sea of love
...
