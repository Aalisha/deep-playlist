(Verse)
I make music I consider a challenge
Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggaz is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island, woah
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggaz still want beef than holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons, cocaine lessons, just a plot of towers
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up
