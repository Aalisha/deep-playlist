Man, this place feels like a catalog
I wonder if your close-up has taken too long
Would you like a snapshot to send to your mother?

Boy, I don't care
I don't want to know
It's never been a part of me
Just like a junkie fears the light of day
I wonder if it's just another role we play
Like a celebrity on minimum wage
I never understood
Never thought I should
It's never been a part of me

Still having nothing
...
