[DJ Paul]
I got, I got my glock in my draws
As I walk the motherfuckin track
Hit me wit some more, if you don't hear me
So I split your wig
Glock, glock in my draws
As I walk the motherfuckin track
Hit me with some more and hit me wit some more
And hit me with some more

[Frayser Boy]
Posted on the fuckin track
Tryin to make these ends meet
Yorks real close as I'm walkin up and down the street
Tryin to get this fuckin money, a nigga like eatin steaks
Pistol to the head of these niggas that be actin fake
Shit is gon get real if you think about testing me
I know you wanna see me gone or see the law arrestin me
You know the game dawg, you bring it and I'm gon fuckin finish
Yeah I know your chest hurt, nigga it's a bullet in it
I got that glock in my draws without a thought or a pause
I'm also dodging them laws, slippin away from they paws
You better gimme respect, before you feel from Tech
We'll leave your whole body wet, with bullet hole in your neck
Leaving your dick in the dust, niggas like me you can't trust
So run Â‘round fuckin with us, pull back the trigger and bust
I'm out here makin this loot, quicker than a prostitute
