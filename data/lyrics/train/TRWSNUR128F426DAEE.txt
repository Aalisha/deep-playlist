Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie tonight

Well, I know a little spot on the edge of town
Where you can really dig 'em up and set 'em down
It's a little place called, The Hideaway
You do the rockabilly till the break of day

Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
