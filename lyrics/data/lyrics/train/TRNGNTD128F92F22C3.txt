The snow has fallen like it does every year
The tree I know so well is aglow
And folks are filled up with the usual holiday cheer
As they hang pretty lights and mistletoe

Oh, but this year is different for you and for me
Our own little miracle, on our own little street
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so
But now that you're here by my side

Baby, it is, baby, it is
