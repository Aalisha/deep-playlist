Well, come in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
Come in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
'Cause your sugar daddy don't want no talkin' back
You keep on a-tellin', talking 'bout this and that
You keep on a-talkin', talking 'bout this and that
I got news for you, you ain't nothing but an alleycat
