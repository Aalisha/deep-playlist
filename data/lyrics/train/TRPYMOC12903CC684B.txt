What is a city without lines?
A forest floor with some children that don't work no more
I am the bush that peeks through blinds
Don't fall behind, rain makes the sheets

For high-tide bakers who bake fancy cakes for magistrative sensitives
And anyone who is for the disconnective gestures of the frontline blue blood pedlars
Sign off, their mothers are boars

Hold the lines, the ferries are sinking
Set upon, wait, your face
I fought the radar
