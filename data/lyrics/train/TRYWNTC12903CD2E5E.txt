There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand

Lady evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night
All right

In a place just south of Witches' Valley
...
