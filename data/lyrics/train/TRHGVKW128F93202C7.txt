I'm going down to Feather River Canyon
Gotta go down, Donner Summit is closed
Another eighty miles and I'm lonesome
'Cause I'll be late gettin' home

Roll truck roll, take me to my baby
I'm tired of bein' alone
Roll truck roll, I wanna see my baby
Roll truck roll me on home

One of these days I'm gonna quit this old road
When I've saved enough money
Gonna buy me a place back home and live a little
...
