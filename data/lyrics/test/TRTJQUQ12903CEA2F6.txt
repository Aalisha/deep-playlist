It's not a problem
Give me the answer

And how can I get close to you
When all you do is push me away
And how can I get close to you
When all you do is push me away

It's not a problem, well, it's a problem to you
Give me the answer and I'll give you the clue
You're at your hideout, you're only part of the new
Turning your back at your own side

And how can I get close to you
