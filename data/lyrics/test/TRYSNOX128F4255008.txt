After all, the broken stones
That were thrown, for no good reason
Inside, she's loving him still
After all this time
And though her heart bears the scars
No sign of healing, It's alright
She's loving him still, after all this time.

Trying to push the past away
Still waiting for the lights to change
But she'll try, try for the sake of their pride, pride
Learning to barely feel the pain
The thicker the skin the less the strain
