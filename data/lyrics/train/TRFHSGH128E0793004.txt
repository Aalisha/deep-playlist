She showed her navel
She wore the label
She wore it thigh-high

Old-time sticky lipstick
Knockin' at my door
I just turn up the hi-fi

Well, it's a plain shame
It took me all this time to learn
(So long to love)
Well it's a plain shame
No matter which way you turn

She'd like to taste me
She'd like to waste me
...
