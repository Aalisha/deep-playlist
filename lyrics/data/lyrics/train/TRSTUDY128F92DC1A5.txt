Take off your trousers and hang them in the air
I know you're blocked but no one seems to care

When the sun goes down on all the things you said
When the sun goes up on all the living-dead

Why must you hide in the lazy shade of timeâ€¦
Won't you set your dreams on fire, won't you set your dreams on fire
...
