It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town
The only way to get there's to go straight down

There's no bathroom and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow
