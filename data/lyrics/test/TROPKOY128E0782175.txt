You look like a dream
but it's obscence the way you play your game.
You treat them like a number without a name.
Lovers used
their hearts abused
I'm gone without a trace.
Don't you know it's time to mend your ways?

Don't wanna be heartache number nine -
I'm not gonna play that part.
I'm gonna be the one to change your mind

You're never gonna break my heart.
