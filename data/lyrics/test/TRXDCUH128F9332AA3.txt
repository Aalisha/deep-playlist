Little princess

One smokin' body, half a brain
Enough to drive the guys insane
And, yeah your boobs are really ace and so's your face
I'm sorry but I'm not your kind
Cause I don't stab friends from behind
But when it comes to flashin' ass, yes you are head of the class

Yet deep inside you feel the sting
Could there be more beneath your skin?
But guys don't want no part of that
They just want you on your back

Little princess got it made
With your million dollar face
Yes, you're hot and daddy's rich
But you're one shallow bimbo bitch
Little Princess you da bomb
Your priorities gone wrong
Everybody joins your dance,
...
