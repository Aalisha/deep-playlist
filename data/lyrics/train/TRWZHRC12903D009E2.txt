Feeling the sway of the bridge beneath me
I watch the windsock strain
Stepping with care as though there's nothing beneath me,
And I'm alone again

Taking the strain of the lateral movement
My escape is clear;
Follow the road to one of two directions
Can I control my fear?

And I can feel it pulling, the paranoia's rife!
There's nothing like a crisis in mid-life!
