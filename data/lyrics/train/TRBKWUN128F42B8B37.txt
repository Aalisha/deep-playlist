I want you near me
I need to feel you by my side
When we're together
You bring my fantasies alive

I'm alive
You're alive
We're alive

Chorus:
Come on and touch me, you're all that I need
Come on and touch me, believe and be free

You've got this power to hold me
You've got the strength to control me
I'll follow you if you show me
...
