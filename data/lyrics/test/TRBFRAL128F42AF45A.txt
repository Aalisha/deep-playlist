Hurry up and give your lovin to me,
Right now I need your body near me,
Girl you, need to, be right, here with me so,
(X2)

Verse One:
Girl Im feelin so alone by myself in this big home,
wishin you were here with me,
decided to try my luck, by callin you up,
hopin you can take me up out this misery,
As time passed me by, I'm askin myself why,
am i lyin by myself, this ain't good for my health,
which all the more reasons that you should be, right here baby, right now baby,

Chours:
Hurry up and give your lovin to me,
Right now I need your body near me,
Girl you, need to, be right, here with me so
(X2)
