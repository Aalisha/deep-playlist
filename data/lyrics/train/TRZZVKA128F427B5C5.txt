In these eyes there is none between
She fades the night that once filled your reasons to run away
When all that you've imagined can be wrapped up in a word
When you're in this you think, you know you could fly

She leaves you laughing
she leads you in
and with a heart like you, she holds the pain
if she wants your heart, she will open your eyes
A lot like you, she wants to believe

And you said these eyes could never be in love
