(Verse 1)
Looking in the mirror, I can see myself, standing in your arms,
Holding me, and kissing me, and loving me.
Ooooh! You just canâ€™t get enough of me.
Now Iâ€™m on the phone, telling you Iâ€™m all alone, so come on over.
Iâ€™m out the shower now, about to oil down,
I canâ€™t wait â€˜till you get hereâ€¦

(Chorus)
I wanna be like those girls in the movies,
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees.
Sheâ€™s even on his mind, while heâ€™s asleep at night,
â€™Cause thatâ€™s the feeling youâ€™ve given me.

(Chorus)
I wanna be like those girls in the movies,
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees.
Sheâ€™s even on his mind, while heâ€™s asleep at night,
â€™Cause thatâ€™s the feeling youâ€™ve given me.

(Verse 2)
Iâ€™m almost ready to accept the truth
Iâ€™m in love with you and I wanna tell you,
Iâ€™m glad that youâ€™re here, uhh,
...
