He opened the door and walked away,
Sometimes a selfless step is all it takes,
From the mountain, he can watch it all burn,
Welcome friend, to the point of no return

Once in a life, you can find a time to see,
and you get to turn it down, turn around, temporary sanity
And then the mountain disappears without a trace,
All it took, was a sudden leap of faith

(Homeward, let your spirit rise, )
Darling, I'm waiting for you
(Homeward, one step at a time)
(Homeward, watch it like a child)
When will I reach the ocean
(I'm filled with mixed emotion)
