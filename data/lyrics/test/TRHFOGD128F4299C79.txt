Time to get the riot started
Starry eyed and down for whatever
Take your aim and hit the target
Ready-steady-go for whenever

This monkey-nation
Is coming out the basement tonight
And when the whip cracks downâ€¦
You better start to move your feet
Cause those sixteen tons fall heavy
When they hit the street
And when the walls come down
We'll be shaking like there's no tomorrow
