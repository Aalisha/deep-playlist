Time keeps movin' on
Friends they turn away
I keep movin' on
But I never find out why
I keep pushing so hard the dream
I keep tryin' to make it right
Through another lonely day, whoa

Dawn has come at last
Twenty-five years, honey, just in one night, oh yeah
Well, I'm twenty-five years older now
So I know we can't be right
And I'm no better, baby
But I can't help you no more
Than I did when just a girl

Aww, but it don't make no difference, baby, no, no
And I know that I could always try
It don't make no difference, babe, yeah
I better hold it now
I better need it, yeah
I better use it 'til the day I die, whoa

Don't expect any answers, dear
