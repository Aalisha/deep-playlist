The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
I know it's over 'cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection, I ain't feelin' what I see
It's no mystery

Whatever happened to a passion I could live for?
What became of the flame that made me feel more
And when did I forget

That I was made to love you, I was made to find you
I was made just for you, made to adore you
I was made to love and be loved by you?

You were here before me, you were waiting on me
And you said you'd keep me, never would you leave me
I was made to love and be loved by you
(And be loved by you)

The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
Back in the ring, you've got me swinging for the grand prize
I feel the hate is spittin' vapors on my dreams
But I still believe
