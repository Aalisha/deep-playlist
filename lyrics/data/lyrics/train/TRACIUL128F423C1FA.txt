(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
[Incomprehensible]

There is a place up the street
It's a funky little place we can meet
It's my house built for love

From the kitchen to the basement, wall to wall
See that chair, I put it there
The vibrations of love are everywhere

And when things are going crazy
I'll be your shelter, baby, keep you warm
And keep you from the rain, hey, hey

Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in
(House of love)
Come a come, come a come on in, come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in

Just stop on by, anytime
