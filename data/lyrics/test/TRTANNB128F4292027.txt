Looking out the window
It's beautiful out there
Give me reasons to remeber
Summer trees are stripped and almost bare
It's late september
Call the sun to kiss it better
Thank God for understanding

It seemed that we were on the youth
It looked like you were under fire
And all the love was never true
...
