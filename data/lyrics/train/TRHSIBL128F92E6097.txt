The street light
Through my window
Makes me feel secure
There's no one to distract me
I'm locking the door
You cannot barge into
My own little world
You can't take the joy
From the soul of this girl

Telling me your lies, lies, lies
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies

My thoughts are all tangled
I don't know what I feel
...
