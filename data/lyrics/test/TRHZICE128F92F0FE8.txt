More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do
'Cause without we cheat and we learn
From each and every heart affair
It's without we cheat and we hurt
Till somebody's in despair

Boom, keep in tune
Hollywood will soon left the point
Right to the point smokin'
Like it's a joint, makin'
Ain't got time to be fakin'
It's my turn and I'm takin'
Everything without shakin'
Yo here with the bacon
...
