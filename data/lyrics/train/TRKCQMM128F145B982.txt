My friends tell me she'll be back some day
Until then, I'll have to find a way

I've tried so very hard to be
Someone she'd fall in love with
I cry my eyes out, she's no good
It's true and I know it
I guess she's just a crazy, mixed up kid

Everybody says she'll come around
Until she does, you know, I won't be found
