I don't know what I was thinking
'Til I was thinking of you
I don't remember a thing before
I opened my eyes and you came into view
I don't know what I was doing
When there was nothing to do
Must've been waiting for someone, baby
Now I can see, I was waiting for you

I'd give up my sight just to see you
I'd beg, I would borrow and steal
I'd cut off my hands just to touch you
And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel
There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't want to be me
If I didn't have you

Driving myself to distraction
Until you got in my way
...
