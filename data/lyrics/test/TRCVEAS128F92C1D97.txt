What if you could wish me away?
What if you spoke those words today?

I wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone
It's come to this, release me
I'll leave before the dawn

But for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do
...
