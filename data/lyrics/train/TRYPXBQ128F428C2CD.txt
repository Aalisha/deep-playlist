Up and down this road I go, skippin' and dodgin' from a 44|

10: 03 on a Tuesday morning
In the fall of an American dream
A man is doing what he knows is right
On flight 93
He loved his mom and he loved his dad
He loved his home and he loved his man
But on that bloody, Tuesday morning
He died an American
Now you cannot change this
You can't erase this
