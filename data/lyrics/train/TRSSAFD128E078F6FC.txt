doo-doo-doo-doo-do-doo (repeat 3x)
Cherish is the word
I use to describe
all the feelings that I have
hiding here for you inside
hey-hey-hey-hey
you don't know how many times I wish that I had told you
you don't know how many times I wish that I had held you, yeah
you don't know how many times I wish I could mold you into someone

chorus:

cherish me as much as I
(who could cherish me)
as much as I
cherish you
as much as I cherish you
