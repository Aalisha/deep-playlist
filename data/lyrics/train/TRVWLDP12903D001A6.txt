Something cool,
Something cool,
Something cool,
I'd like to order something cool!

Something cool, (something cool)
I'd like to order something cool, (something cool)
It's so warm here in town,
And the heat gets me down,
Yes, I'd like something cool! (something cool)

My! It's nice to simply sit and rest awhile,
Now I know it's a shame,
I can't think of your name,
I remember your smile!

I don't ordinarily drink with strangers,
I most usually drink alone.
