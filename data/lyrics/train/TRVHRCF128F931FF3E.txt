I just don't know the layman's terms
to call the mess you breed
What thaws beneath this surface
soils blood to your family tree
The dates they change
with each new phase
i'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises
this switch it won't come on
What do I do to lose it
beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn
Let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck
with the body inside

Let the wheels burn
Let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck
with the body inside

Frames of infrared
