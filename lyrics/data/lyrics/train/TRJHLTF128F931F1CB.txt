Been through a lot in the last year
It's like everything I love is slipping away
And every time I come home
Some more of me isn't there
I've gotta get it together
I need to do things for myself
I've given everything
But still you take more from me
I need some room to breathe

Come on come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be O-K)
Lets go back
Go back
To a time where I
Still felt I had a family

This isn't what I remember
Everyone's looking out for just themselves
