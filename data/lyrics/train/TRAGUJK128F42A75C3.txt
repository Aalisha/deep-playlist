Kneel down you sinners, to streetwise religion
Greed's been crowned the new king
Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
Save the blessing for the final ring, Amen

Take a ride
At the wild side

Wild side

...
I carry my crucifix under my death list
Forward my mail to me in hell
Liars and the martyrs, lost faith in the Father

Long lost is the wishing well
Do you ride
...
