I can't see your face anymore
through our broken past
I can't feel your pain anymore
I am free at last

this love is lost like a distant sun
in an endless sea
I tried to spread my wings and fly
nothing's left of me

I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone		

I can't feel your touch anymore
though you're next to me
can't taste the tears anymore
...
