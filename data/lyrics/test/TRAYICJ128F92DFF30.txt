I'm going home to see my baby
Big sweet baby of mine
Been so long without my baby
Sometimes I feel
I'm plum goin' outta my mind
I'm leaving this town early next mornin
Big sweet baby of mine
It won't be long before we're together now
Baby and me, happy until the end of time

I just can't go on without him
I miss him more and more each day
and all I do is dream about my baby
and his lovin' ways
I need someone to live me
To take me by the hand
