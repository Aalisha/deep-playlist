I'ma gonna take you down to the railway line
I'ma gonna take you down to the railway line
I'ma gonna take you where your heart won't brake you
And the water tastes like wine
I'ma gonna take you down to the railway line

We won't take money, we won't take the long way round
We won't take money, we won't take the long way round
We won't take money, we'll live off the honey
When the train goes underground
We won't take money, we won't take the long way round
