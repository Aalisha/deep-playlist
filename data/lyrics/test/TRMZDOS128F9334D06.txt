You're telling me
that I'm the most important thing to you,
but can't you see?
you're killing me with all the things you do,
and I really want to believe it's impossible
I really want to believe it's all a dream,
but I just can't seem to wake up,
I just can't seem to turn on the light,
one step off the edge
...
