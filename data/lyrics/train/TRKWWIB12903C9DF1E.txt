She says no
When she means yes
And what she wants
You know that I can't guess
When we want more
You know we ask for less
Such is the language of love

I say leave
When I mean stay
But she don't see
And so she moves away
What we really want
You know we rarely say
Such is the language of love

It's tooth for tooth
And eye for eye
We hide our hearts
And then we won't say why
...
