Now you're holding in your hands
Broken blades and shards
Just remember that the ending
Is the greater part

All that you have ever loved now
thrown into a hole
Dust to dust there
Dug with your own bones

Through the seaweed there's a hero
Feeling pretty down
Longing only to surrender
But no-one can be found
...
