Back to the castle...
returning you might say...
there's a vat of brains and it's brain mashing day,
the lord of the manor has been up to no good...
and now he must pay...

Refined psychopath with a metal jaw...
Primitive justice comes to call
an angry mob approaches...
peasants the lot of them...
toting a priest and some pitchforks...
just like a Dracula film
...
