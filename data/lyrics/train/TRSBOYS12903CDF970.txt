Massive depression has
Fractured your ways
Ignited the flames
The world set ablaze
There is no solution
When you're the main problem
Littered their minds
With no way to solve them

Mind pollution
Mind pollution

Contaminated thoughts
This isn't the way
Too delusional to think
If we'll ever pay
Violent frustration
With such devastation
Small simple step
Towards world domination

Poisoning judgement
To agree with deceit
Taken my youth
The end bitter sweet
No quest is this easy
You take all it's tension
Taking no break from this
...
