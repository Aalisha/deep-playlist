*two gun shots*

It's a story about two brothers, Rob and Vic
Grew up in the world alone
God forgot about them, hmm
Forced to fend for themselves
In the Rotten Apples of New York City
This story takes place, in 1993

How many nigs did we get so far?
I couldn't care to count
Just snatch em up quick
If he scream, I'ma put him out
I put the heat to his face to SHUT HIM UP
so I can dig him out
Went in his pockets and got the cash in some big amounts
I looked him dead cold in his eyes, *blast* without carin
If money speak, that explain the voices I've been hearin
You ain't really have to kill him
Yo God he moved -- but I lied
Damn, there's our sick stick-up turned homicide
So? That's the way our momma died
Is you with me I'ma slide

[both]
So we slid, had to get our gameplan together
Cause this little bit of stickup loot ain't lastin us forever
Desperate, on the edge with no place to go
We can't go back to the hood we stuck up everyone we know

Chorus: *sung*

For the love of money, people will rob from each other
For the love of money, people will steal from their mother
For the love of money, people will kill their own brother.

Now everytime I hear a fuckin siren, my heart skip a beat
I'm paranoid, every face I see I think he after me
Supposedly
we was supposed to be gettin work from this large cat
But since we know where he rest at -- we goin Bogart!
Son frontin so hard
