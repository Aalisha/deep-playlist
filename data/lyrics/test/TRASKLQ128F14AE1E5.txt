everyday is a new day
and i don't have to pretend
all my friends think i'm crazy
but i don't want this to end

when i have the chance i want to say to you
i can never take back what i put you through
i'll never do it again
we're like oil and water still we somehow mix
and what used to be broken is somehow fixed
it's hard to explain

i know some people say that opposites attract
if that's the truth then we
we will be together forever
