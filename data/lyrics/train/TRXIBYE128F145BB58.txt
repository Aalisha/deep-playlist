And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share an' castle walls
Just leave me to despair

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky
A dream come true, I'll live there 'til I die
I'm asking you, to say my last goodbye
The love we knew, ain't worth another try

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
...
