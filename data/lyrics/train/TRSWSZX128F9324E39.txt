Father, help Your children
And don't let them fall by the side of the road
And teach them to love one another
That Heaven might find a place in their hearts

'Cause Jesus is love, He won't let you down
And I know, I know He's mine forever in my heart

And we've gotta walk on, walk on through temptation
'Cause His love and His wisdom will be our helping hand
And I know the truth and His words, they will be our salvation
Lift up our hearts to be thankful and glad

That Jesus is love, He won't let you down
I know He's mine deep down in my soul
