Lookin out a dirty old window,
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,
Friday night and everyone's moving.
I can feel the heat but its soothing heading down,
I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing

[[Chorus:]]
We're the kids in america,
We're the kids in america,
...
