[Intro:]
Gangstas paradise, it nuh nice, watch'it(watch'it)

[Verse 1:]
This is gangstas paradise, yeah! life is
Not a game of checkers or a dice
Gangstas paradise, yeah(garrison and gun come)
Welcome to my world, weed, guns and girls
Grab a, couple babba, welcome to my world
Weed, money and girl(we wi deeeh deeeey)
Welcome to my world, gangsta deh dey, gal deh dey
Some real shotta who ready fi bust it deh dey
My world gun inna, informer get shot in dem dominion
Squeeze trigga 'til finger fi get numb mi dun warn you
Man wi corner you, man who wi bomb you
Black rain wi wet you like st Andrew
We nah go calm when heat turn on, we bring it on
Give him di extra clip fi hang on to

[Chorus:]
To my world, weed, guns and girls
Grab a, couple babba, welcome to my world
Weed, money and girl yeah! we tuffs nuh play
Welcome to my world

[Verse 2:]
