My Papa told me to stay out of trouble
When you've found your man, make sure he's for real
I've learnt that nothing really lasts for ever
I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal
They won't heal

'Cause every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game
And the pain stays the same

I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew
My mama told me not to mess with sorrow
But I always did, and Lord, I still do
