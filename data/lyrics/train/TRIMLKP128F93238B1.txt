I know nothing
Don't know much
I think my education's
Gone out to lunch

I can't remember
I can't think
what is the difference
Between iron and zinc

I can listen
I can speak
But my conversational skills
Are gobblesegeek

I know Harold
In 1066
Got shot in the eye
With a long pointy stick

Revolutions and World War II
Is it true what they say
That Charles de Gaulle was a hero
And Churchill's a Nero
I threw that away

I get up when I like
Wear anything I like
Don't keep up with the cool
I make up my own rules

Don't have to eat my greens
Or keep my bedroom extra tidy
...
