Ja Rule feat. Ashley Joi


(Ashley Joi)
Chorus
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me.
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair,
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired.
(REPEAT TWICE)


(Ja Rule)

Follow in my foot steps and girl if you ain't scared I'm gonna be right there, I'm a be the n***a you lean on, go on, let your mind state run free
Their ain't nothing but your open arms that can hold me.
Like when I'm runnin, runnin hopin the world will keep up wit me,
Or when I'm runnin, gunnin wantin the world to stay away from me.
Pray on, but your heart still wit me, ain't nothing but your open arms that can free me,
You know, that I'd miss every part of your body if you were gone.
How the hell can a n***g be so surrounded and feel alone and why would I be so selfish in helping stoppin your growth... I gotta let her go.


Chorus
Gotta let me live, gotta let me do for me
Gotta let me learn, gotta let me finally be free,
Even if I'm scared and it ain't fair
Gotta make it clear this heart here will be repaired
(REPEAT TWICE)
