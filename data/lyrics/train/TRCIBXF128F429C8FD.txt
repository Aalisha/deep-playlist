This is a song for Carol

You're into Japanese fast food
And I drop you off with your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like
You've got some sun
Your blistered lips
Have got a kiss
They taste a bit like everyone
