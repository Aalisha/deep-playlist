You know
some people just don't know what I'm talking about
But I know you understand
'cause I know you believe.

CHORUS
Baby, I believe
that you were meant for me
and if there's somebody
then baby, I believe
that somebody is you
and everything you do
'cause baby, I believe
I believe in you.

I walk home alone
waitin' by the telephone
all my girlfriends say
give it up, baby, give it up.

I know that you can see
this is how it's meant to be
you're my frequency
'cause baby, I believe.

CHORUS
Baby, I believe
that you were meant for me
and if there's somebody
then baby, I believe
that somebody is you
and everything you do
