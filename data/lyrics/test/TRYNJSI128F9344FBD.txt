Once upon a time - this is almost true
When the sun came out for a day or two
It would beat the war to the top of the news
- This'll make no sense in 2102
When the antiques show where the river once flowed
And your gran remembers having no suntan at all - and waterfalls
Where did the waterfalls go?
Welcome to the meltdown
