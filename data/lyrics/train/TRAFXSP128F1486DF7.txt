Unh... yeah... you know uh... it's the A baby...

[Chorus: x2]
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (girl, I'm so)
(Soul) so real (soul) so fly
(Soul) so wise (soul) so right
(I'm soul) so grown (soul) so on
(Soul) so on (soul)

[Verse 1:]
Cadillac night and caramel cake
Sittin' on vogues with golden flakes
Kangol tilted t'wards yo' way
Ridin' slow down M.L.K.
I'm soul... I'm soul
That's soul... that's soul
A-Town's gleamin' 'cross my face
Everybody's watchin' me
Say pretty lady, are you hungry
