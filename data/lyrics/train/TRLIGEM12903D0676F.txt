Gravity is a factor,
Feel it pulling you in.
It gets under your skin,
And you just sink in.

When the past is an anchor,
It's just holding you back,
When you can't walk away,
Something makes you stay, makes you stay.

What makes you turn around and do it all again?
Your highs and lows they are both one and the same,
There is no difference in your pleasure and your pain,
It's time to face the music.

You can see what you can be,
