You did all you could do and I will still love you, but it's time to move ...
True, we both always knew that, everything we do, it never ends well.
We try. She's dry and he's all blue.
Tonight we fight to make it right. Our mouths don't mean to say... Do they?
We should break up. Hold on, let's make up.
Tonight we search for words to stay in love another day.
We should break up. Come on let's make up.

You did all you could do and I will still love you when it's time to move on.
True, we both always knew that, every word we choose, it never sounds right.
