[Verse 1]
Pitch black red clay screams echo from the trees kudzu covers every living thing and dead folks seen down by the side of the road voodoo chants to echos and the squak of the crows yeah who knows just what you'll find on a midnight ride if ya stoppin for a piss or if ya battery dies you'll wanna keep on movin don't stop for a second there's a thousand lost souls who fuckin learned that lesson

[Bridge]
Somewhere past the old cemetary there's a place where evil death live the sun nevers shines and the devil walks by this place ain't nothin to mess with (Red Dirt Road)

[Chorus]
You'll die all alone where no one knows so don't ride down that old red dirt road
