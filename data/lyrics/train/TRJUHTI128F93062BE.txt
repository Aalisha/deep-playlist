I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel disco good
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel disco good

I feel good
When he's guiding me with his hands
I feel good
He is music, I am the dance
I feel good
With the feeling that begs for more
I feel good
Making love out here on the floor

I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel disco good
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel disco good

I feel disco good, let's do it, baby
I feel disco good, can you dig it?
I feel disco good, let's do it, baby
I feel disco good, can you dig it, baby?
