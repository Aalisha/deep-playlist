I've been on my way
For such a long time
Singing the blues
Up and down this road
Seen good times
And i've seen bad times sometimes
But i wanna go back
To the time and place i used to know
Let me ride
Ride on the slow train
Carry me home
Carry me home
Been out on the street
With the brokedown and hungry
Drank wine with kings and queens
Seen right and wrong
