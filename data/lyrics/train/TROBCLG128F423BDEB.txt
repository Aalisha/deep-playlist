This world in sin, of plagues and pain
We fall, we crawl
No war, no more
Them eyes, they bled for a thousand days
Them eyes, they bled in a thousand ways

This war was heard around the world
It made our ways insane again
Their mouths were shut
They blot out the sun
They fought this war like never before
