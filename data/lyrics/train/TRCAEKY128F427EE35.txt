See the man ridin high in the desert near the Rio Grande
Runs for his life, doesnt sleep, doesnt take time to understand
Cause the girl that he loved went away and ran off with another man
But he followed them both and he shot at the throat, couldnt stop his hand.
So now hes under the gun.

He was born and raised and he lived like the son of an honest man
And who wouldve thought that one day he might gun down another man
But his heart gave away to the gun in his hand
Couldnt stop it, No
