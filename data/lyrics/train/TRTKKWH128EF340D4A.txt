I’m not a man, I’m a machine
Chisel me down until I am clean
I buy books, I never read
And then I’ll tell you some more about me

Beneath the concrete there’s a sound
A muffled cry below the ground
There is a poison in the air
A mix of chemicals and fear

Manners are just hunches
I’m not sure what they mean
You’re asking for commitment
When I’m somewhere in between

Never, never try to gauge temperature
When you tend to travel
At such speed
It's our velocity

Is it cold where you are
This time of the year?
You didn’t leave a scar

I’ve seen that numbers hit a screen
And you’re expected to know what they mean
Throughout the conflict I was serene
I can't outrun the sadness I’ve seen
...
