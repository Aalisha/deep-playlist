Went so fast I can't believe it
One day here the next they leavin'
I just never thought this could happen to me
Well was there somethin' I did wrong?

I know you're gone
You've been away so long
I know you're gone and you'll
Never never never never never never come back on

Dad told me to forget it
things get lost so just live with it
I just think it's gonna get worse everyday
