Every day it seems that I turn another page,
And it feels like the heartache fades a little more away,
I look in the mirror and I like what I see,
Hey you didn't take that much, baby, out of me...

Something proud and something strong,
Fills the absence of a memory that's dead and gone...

(Chorus)
I do believe I'm crossing over,
I feel that weight come off my shoulder,
I close my eyes, and I drift over
To the other side...
And lord I swear I'm crossing over,
I found the strength to let you go,
And the thought of you, is getting colder and further from my mind...
And I think I've crossed that line- to the other side...
...
