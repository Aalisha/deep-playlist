decease is just an irony of fate
multiple rites i'm gonna lose my way
paraphilliac body control
to slay the phantom from my soul

...you're gonna die!

unholy evil prophets rise
fire is raining from the endless skies
can you hear the final thunder roaring
napalm in the morning

skin peeling off to drop your timid mask
you wish that death redeems you fast
creation of the fire seems the perfect nude
your carbonized torso just a part of you

...you're gonna die!

unholy evil prophets rise
...
