When marimba rythm starts to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean laps the shore, hold me close
Sway me more.

When marimba rythm starts to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean laps the shore, hold me close
Sway me more.

When marimba rythm starts to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean laps the shore, hold me close
Sway me more.

Cha cha cha cha cha!
