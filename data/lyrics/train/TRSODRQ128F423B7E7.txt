Life is like a school
No applications just pick your class
No matter how smart, any old fool
Is accepted and theres no exams to pass

High grades or low grades you'll get to choose
Your vert own class mates, some of them you'll lose
others stay to the bitter end
And that goes for both fiend and friend
Your time here can seem vert short

So why not get the best out of it
True friends will show their support
Get rid of the ones that don't give a shit
...
