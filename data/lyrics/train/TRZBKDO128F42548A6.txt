Upwards a shimmering nightsky
Of far so distant starlight
Above the obsolete horizonlines death came to reap
Towards the cosmic hillsides beyond the lunar galaxy
Closing down the fleshworld
Forever as the soulside awakes
Whirling down a maelstrom of horror infernal
Possessed by the grim and bleak eyes
Of the seventh moon.
Breathing the rippeling rythm of the coldest night
Through shadows hearses must be led across
The puzzling constellation of a deathrune
The ancient sign of magic
Divine and flamboyance burning
