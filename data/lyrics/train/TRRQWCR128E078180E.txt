Sitting in traffic on the Tappan Zee
Fifty million people out in front of me
Trying to cross the water but it just might be a while
Rain's coming down, I can't see a thing
Radio's broken, so I'm whistling
New York to Nyack feels like a hundred miles

It's not right
It's not fair
I'm still a mess
And you still don't care
I go to work
I come back home
But you're still gone and I'm still alone
And the little red light's not blinking
No no, the little red light's not blinking
No no, the little red light's not blinking
...
