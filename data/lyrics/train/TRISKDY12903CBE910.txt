Oh, God
Your rescue follows close
I have run
As far has anyone could go

But Your love
Is calling me, love
Overwhelming, Your love
There's no stopping it now

Awaken my soul
Awaken my soul
All I've gained, I'm letting go
Letting go
Awaken my soul

Oh, God
When storms will follow close
And I run
...
