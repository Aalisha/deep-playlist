: Fade in:
to do do
down dooby doo down down, comma comma
down dooby doo down down, comma comma
down dooby doo down down
breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
'If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

Re-mem-ber when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
