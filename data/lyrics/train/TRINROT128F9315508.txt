Soap is in the air
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air
All aroundJust when you need it

Soap is in the air
Feel it everywhere
There is magic in the air
Come come
Soap is in the air tonight

Here's another round, blowing up and smiling down
When you hear the sound, put your feet back on the ground
Soap is in the air, freaky people everywhere
People they stop and stare, but we really donÂ¹t care
We're ladi dadi, this is how we party
If a friend's in trouble, baby we can do karate
So get your hands up come on get your hands up
See the club packed, wanna get it all back

Soap is in the air
Feel it every where
There is magic in the air
All aroundJust when you need it
