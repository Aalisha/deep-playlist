Baby don't put the sugar on me
Don't talk me up so sweet
Baby don't dress me in your kisses
When they're not mine to keep
Some boys think I'm carved out of stone
Guess they're not so smart
'Cause just a few kind words from you
And I fall apart
Oh yes I do I fall apart

So baby don't
Come around here tossing matches
Oh no don't you tempt
...
