So I'm on the phone wit this shorty right?
I'm like, baby we about to do this
So why you, why you want the lights on?
So you know, I figured out
 (Shorty like it better with the lights on)
That she liked to watch what's goin' down
(Shorty like it better with the lights on)
So I was like aiight, it's somethin' new but, I'm 'bout it, let's go

She got, she got the kind of love that make you wanna
Stand up in the club singin' 'Go shorty'
She got, she got the kinda of drop
Make a **** go out and cop anything that she wanted

She got, she got the heat to light that **** like fire
And if you need a hit, I dare you to trya, trya, trya
Baby girl'll get ya higher higher higher

She'll have ya feelin' like
'Cuz ain't nobody betta at workin' that thang down
And she'll work it out, don't turn the lights out, 'cuz

Shorty like it better with the lights on
Shake a little harder with the lights on
And when she get to feelin' the groove then she get into you
Betcha she'll keep ya comin'

Shorty like it better with the lights on
Shake a little harder with the lights on
