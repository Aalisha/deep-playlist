Even though it's hard to hear the truth
It's every little thing that makes you move
And there is a reflection in the mirror
You don't believe
And darling it's so hard to understand
I wish that I could fix what you feel instead
Baby, why'd you do that, I can see through that
Give it a chance

And you can't just disappear
I'm begging you come on out, come on out
Promise that the coast is clear

(chorus)
I don't mind the chase
Baby, you're lost out there in a different place
