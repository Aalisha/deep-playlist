"do the revolutionary step!"
"youknowtheresadance?"
"yeah! yeah!
"do the dance!"
Now let the troop introduce the latest dance
guaranteed to rip through your favourite pants
originated by who? the ladies' man
promoe rock the mic with a stable hand!

Forward ever, backward never!
all my revolutionary steppers and wall wreckers
it takes a nation of million of cops to get us
cosmic here to break up all the government set ups
stay one step ahead - move your dancing feet
we gon' let the dead groove to this bouncin' beat
Already a smash hit cus it sound so sweet
already a classic cus it sound so street
now you better blast this to stress the system
and you better flash this to impress the sistren
the hottest fashion tonight in the club
supreme's hated with a passion by the government thugs!
Do the revolutionary step
a dance you will never forget
do the revolutionary step
step forward my sisters. step forward!
do the revolutionary step
a dance you will never forget
do the revolutionary step
step forward brother... forward
Now forget about poppin' pills, still
