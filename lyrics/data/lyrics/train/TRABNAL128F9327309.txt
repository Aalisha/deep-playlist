I sleep all night right by your side
i love to hear you breathing, breathing
the morning light opens my eyes
its nearly time for leaving, leaving

I know that it seems
like it's easy for me
oh, I wish you could feel
whats going on inside of me

Ref.
It's the hardest thing
I ever have to do
to walk away from you
when I wanna hold you
