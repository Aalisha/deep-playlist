One more time for Ho Jo, you know I can't wait
Another wasted line
I'm sittin' in the corner, I can feel the weight
Of my head on top of my spine
There's nothing to be scared of once you've
Seen the the light, reflecting through the screen
A eudaemonistic life composed of tar and nicotine
You know it, You know it, You know it
...
