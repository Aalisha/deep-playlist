"Boys For Life"

(J-Boog Talking)
Yo, why ya'll have to bring this up man?
I mean it ain't like I forgot but it's like I wasn't thinkin about it man,
now that you wanna talk about it... You got me all watery in the eyes ya
know but uh it's all good I wanna tell you all 3 I love y'all like ya'll
love me but if y'all know what I'm talkin about Fizz holla at cha boy.

(Rap 1:)
For the first 3 yrs
We was on coat fax
No deals no money
But everybody had our back
We knew it would happen and that for a fact
Until then we was washing cars, visiting laundromats
Scrounging up change for a meal at pizza guy
No ride to Roscoe's
We made our own sunrise
Getting sick off cheetoes
Skittles and benekos
Marq yelling cause we eat his last taqeto
Wishing for a bank account with at least 2 zero's
Playing ball all day
Sharing one Gatorade
No dogs of our own
So we walked Bear and Jane
Playing B-B bridges
Hopping over gates
Just to go swimming
Yeah we were bad
Tryna holla at older women
Man
Times was hard
You know we didn't get much
But we had each other and man that was enough

(Chorus:)
