Mmm, oh'
My, my, my, my, my, my baby
You're mine, mine, mine, mine
I'm gonna love you right, girl

You may be young but you're ready
[Ready to learn]
You're not a little girl, you're a woman
[Take my hand] Let me tell you, baby

I'm yours for the takin'
So you can [Do what you please]
Don't take my love for granted
You're all I [I'll ever need]

Hold me, hold me in your arms
[Oh'baby] Never let me go
