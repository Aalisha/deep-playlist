I would sink,
I would go down down down,
Bleak like a brig with a leak,
But on this sea,
You reach out for me,
You take me up,
You take me up.

Baby you're the mountain,
That no one can shake,
I'm on top,
Brittle as cornflake,
If you leave me,
I'd fall from the mountain to the sea,
You take me up,
You take me up.

Wau wau wau wau waaa
Wau wau wau wau waaaaaa
