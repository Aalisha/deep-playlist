20 hours deep
it was enough time to see that everything has changed for me

so much for birthday wishes
ive been too busy with my memories you made me
i dont think ill get over it
to be honest i cant see how this could be fair
im so alone but you seem to be just fine

dont ask me to think
good intentions wont change everything
this could be the last day i hold my breath
