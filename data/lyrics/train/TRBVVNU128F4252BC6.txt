One murder coming on
Say I'm wrong for all I've done
Are you god to judge us all?
Prophet false with a jury hung

Home
An empty shell of a living hell
A human zoo full of cannibals
Backwards life, it's a dirty world
Where your dreams can't be heard

A shallow grave is where I dwell
Buried alive within this cell
A shadow cast upon my fate
...
