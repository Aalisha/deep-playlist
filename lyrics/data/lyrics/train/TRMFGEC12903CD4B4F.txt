I will twine and will mingle my raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale emanita and hyssop so blue

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
...
