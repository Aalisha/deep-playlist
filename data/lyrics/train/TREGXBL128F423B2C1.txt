It cuts me deep
And it cuts me wide
This gut rock feelin'
I get inside
And I blame you
But it's really me
Can't rid myself
Of jealousy

When I'm away
And you're at home
I don't believe
You're on your own
It's my foolish
Insecurity
Can't rid myself
Of jealousy

Jealousy
As thick as mud
It's in my veins
It's in my blood
...
