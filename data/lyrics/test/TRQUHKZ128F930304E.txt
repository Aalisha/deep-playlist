If only we could fly
Limp Bizkit style
John Otto
Take em to the Matthews Bridge

Can you feel it?
My g-g-generation

My g-g-generation
Are you ready?
Do you know where you are?
Welcome to the jungle punk
Take a look around
It's Limp Bizkit
' up your town
We downloaded the Shockwave
For all the ladies in the cave
To get your groove on
And maybe I'm the one
Who flew over the cuckoo's nest
But guess who's next? (who?)
Generation X

Generation Strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane
So go ahead and talk
Talk about me

Go ahead and talk
About my g-g-generation
Cause we don't, don't give a, and
We won't ever give a
