Little children, you better not tell on me
I'm tellin' you little children, you better not tell what you see
And if you're good, I'll give you candy and a quarter
If you're quiet like you oughta be and keep a secret with me

I wish they would go away, little children
Now why ain't you playin' outside? I'm askin' you
