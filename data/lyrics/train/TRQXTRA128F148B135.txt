The day you left me
There was a feeling I have never shown
The day you told me
There were the words that I have never known

And now it's over
So what's left that I should ever feel
'Cause since the day you left me I have been so alone
And now we're left with broken promises

My heart can't take no more
And now we're left with broken promises
My mind has had enough
Deep inside me

There are things that I have never told
They burn inside me
...
