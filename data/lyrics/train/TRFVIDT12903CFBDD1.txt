You tuned in to Jay Stay Paid
(No)
5-1 FM
For the freshest hardcore J Dilla shit
You ever gon' hear in yo' life baby

You know it is I, the boy Frank Nitt'
Pumps blowin', jewelry glowin' on some Detroit shit
And you know about the spit
The jewels ain't got nuttin' to do with that

Bring it back, I'll beat up the track until it's blue and black
It's Detroit nigga, Jay Stay Paid
