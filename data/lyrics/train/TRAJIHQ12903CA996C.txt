I don't know what's wrong but I'm on fire,
It seers through my hands, leaving skin on the wire
Awake in this womb with a crown sting in my self
When I listen, the same cry plays on.

We're slaves
In this medicated cage
Make a decision to face this change.
The rules they don't explain
So why do we obey?

Politics, religion, your vision's the same
You played us, as both a cancer and a cure
Which reminds me that it's just a game
You're alibi a sales pitch
Your pretty boy, pretty face dolled up again
A star for us to adore
...
