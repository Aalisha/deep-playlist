Welcome, and wake up
This is not a dream but something in between that and reality
Wake up if you dare
This is not the regular nightmare

Before your eyes the world will change
Slowly take you down to unknown places
Welcome to a world that's only yours
Wake up if you dare and just follow me!

Leave me alone
My dreams speak to me or am I still awake?
Leave me alone
I'm my own threat, I'm a victim of my mind
Let go

I fooled you, I warned you though
I won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
I'll play you
You want me to
You ask for more
You want to know

Leave me now, I need to know I'm in control
Leave me alone
Leave me be within my private fantasies
Let go
