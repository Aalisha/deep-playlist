I get it I got it the game has begun
how much longer till my final destination
kick in the door wave in the four four gotta do it
right now cant wait no more
delivery expected right on time you can try to go for
yours coz Im going for mine
it doesnt matter how I get it its what has to be
done the fuses have been lit and the countdowns begun.
I need it by any means necessary [x4]
