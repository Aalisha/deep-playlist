(Chorus)
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

(Verse 1)
Whats wrong with me
Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth

Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
