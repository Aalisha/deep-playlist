Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here and you're miles away

And I wonder why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time just thinking about you

And it's almost driving me wild
But it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone, away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
