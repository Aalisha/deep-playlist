So much has happened since it all began
But I am still your most devoted fans
You know I've always liked the things you do
I got a special feeling, just for you
And we are lovers of a kind
Though late at night you never stay
We see each other all the time
But who knows one day
Though we're not lovers like before
And I still think of you as mine
...
