See the reckless tyrant
That reigns with the iron fist
No chance for him to break you
'Cause you're a liberalist

With thousand miles an hour
You smash down every wall
No force will ever stop you
No one will make you fall

Be the one
To make your dreams come true
See there's only one thing
You must do

You have to fight the fire
You are the hero
You're born to win
Take all that you require
Today you are stronger
Than you've ever been
...
