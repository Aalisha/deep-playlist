We may not have a cent to pay the rent
But were gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to eat beans every day
But were gonna make it, I know we will
And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand in the welfare line
I've got your love and you know you got mine
So were gonna make it, I know we will

We may not have a home to call our own
But were gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
