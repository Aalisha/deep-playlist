And it's been awhile, since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile, since I first saw you
And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile, since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile, since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile, since I can say I love myself as well
