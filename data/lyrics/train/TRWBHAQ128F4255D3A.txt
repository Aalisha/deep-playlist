Waoaoo
This is it
Yeah
Waoaoo

Said I've paid my dues for all that i've done
And I showed you that I loved you more than once
There's nothing left there to decide
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice
Freedom to us has always been a trick
Freedom to you has always been who ever landed on your dick
Seen it in you one too many times
Said you might trick me once, I won't let you trick me twice, no

Might trick me once
Waoaoo
I won't let you trick me twice
Might trick me once
Waoaoo
I won't let you trick me twice, no
Might trick me once
Waoaoo
I won't let you trick me twice
