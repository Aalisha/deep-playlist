Living as we rot
Showered with shadows
Of dreams devoured
Our souls descend
Into endless seas of sin

There's no turning back
No repenting, no remorse
Hate stricken creation
I realize in this world

There is not one truth cast into stone
Only lies cast into flames
There is not one truth cast into stone
Only lies cast into flames
...
