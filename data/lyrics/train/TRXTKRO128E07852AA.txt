I look for You in the middle of the night
Savior and guardian of my soul
From highest heaven You hear my call
And in my trouble You comfort and hold me

I long for You when I cannot hear Your voice
And my heart is dry as the dust
Oh Lord, be near me if I should fall
And show me how to believe and to trust You alone

There is no one else beside You
In the darkest night, in the wilderness
There is no one else beside You
...
