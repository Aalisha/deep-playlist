Every girl wants a guy that's right
And I've been waiting for this guy all my life
Every girl wants a guy that's true
We've been kicking it for a while, it could be you
I want to know where we stand
Are you gonna be a dog, or a gentleman
Baby, come clean, keep it straight with me
Tell me boy, tell me boy, tell me boy, what's it gonna be

I'm not looking for someone to waste my time
And I'm not that kind of girl to read between the lines
I'm into you, but I need to know
If you're feeling me too
If you are, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, babe

Remove your mask do I can see behind
See all the feelings you once tried to hide, ooh yeah
Here's a letter from my heart
Keeps it simple not too hard
I wanna be your girl
Read the sign, down below
Check the box "Yes" or "No"

Every girl wants a guy that's right
And I've been waiting for this guy all my life
Every girl wants a guy that's true
We've been kicking it for a while, it could be you
I want to know where we stand
Are you gonna be a dog, or a gentleman
Baby, come clean, keep it straight with me
