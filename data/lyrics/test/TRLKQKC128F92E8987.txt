Howling winds keep screaming 'round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
