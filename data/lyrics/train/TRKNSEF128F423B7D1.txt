She sees the world through rose-coloured glasses
Painted skies and graceful romances
I see a world that's tired and scared
Of living on the edge too long
Where does she get off telling me
That love could save us all
Save us all

She takes my hand and leads me to nowhere town
No matter where I stand it's always neutral ground
And in the cool of the evening blue
I feel so tired and alone
Where does she get off telling me
...
