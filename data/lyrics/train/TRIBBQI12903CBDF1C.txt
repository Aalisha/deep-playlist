Can you hear me?
Is there anybody out there... But me?
You need to stop talking about yourself.
About yourself... 
Your lies are loose and there's no excuse, 
No excuse, there's no excuse.
Why don't you, Why don't you kick it?
Why don't you, Why don't you kick it?
When I get a taste, when I get a taste for it
When I get a taste, when I get a taste for it
Why don't you, Why don't you kick it?
Why don't you, Why don't you kick it?
...
