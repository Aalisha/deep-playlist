Every morning takes a chance, it might not come around
So it's maybe coming later
A preacher man on my t.v.
Says he's got the streets for me
And prays you write the letter
Heavenly father tell me how it's gonna be
So that I can try to make it better
Restless bars, you and I suppose they are
For blowing it all away
That's why I say

It takes more than love to get it on
You know it takes more than strength to carry on
