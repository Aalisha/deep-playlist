By the light of the lamp I sit to type 
my notes on tab at my side. 
I don't see the sun much these days, 
a fluorescent tan covers my hide. 
How much impact shall I have this time? 
My goal today is to reach the deadline. 
I write between the lines. I deal with fantasy. 
I report the facts. Give them to me, please. 
Ham and egg salad on white bread... 
keeps me company on nights like this.
