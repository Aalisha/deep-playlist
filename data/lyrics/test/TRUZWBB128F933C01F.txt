Will you ever see me
Like a possible lover again?
I am fed up to be
Your twin brother you're not my sister

And everytime
I think of that
I want to...

I wanna say to you
I wanna talk to you

When I look into your eyes
I see a yellow butterfly
When I look into your eyes
I see a yellow butterfly
Flying high in a beautiful
Summer sky

Everytime I look into your eyes
I see a reflection of me
A distorted vision
