(spoken) Oh, I go crazy

I go crazy

I go crazy when I'm without you

What have I done today
Just sat and watched the jets fly over
A car goes by
And the sun goes down
We talk about the town

This city's mad in the head
And sick in the soul
All the stars flew away a long time ago
Isn't that nice
Like Miami Vice

I go crazy when I'm without you
I go crazy when I'm without you

Well your life is like an infants dream
It's like everything's on TV
You see your face in the mirror
Could it be your place in the mirror
...
