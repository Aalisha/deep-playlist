Don't ever leave me
Don't ever leave me
Your pretty brown eyes
Your wavy hair
I won't go home no more
'Cause you're not there
I'm telling you now
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
Don't ever leave me
Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet
...
