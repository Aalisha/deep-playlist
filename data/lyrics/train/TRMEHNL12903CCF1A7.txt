Baby, baby look so fine
let me know that you'll be mine
cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
pick me up and take me home
let your love be all I own
just be my baby through the night
baby take off your leather
and show me all your lace
gimme lovin one thousand ways

cause I'm hungry
yes, I'm hungry
Oh so hungry
hungry for your love
