We go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

You got to look real hard
There's a fiery star
Hidden out there somewhere
Not the satellite of love
But a laser
Shooting out its shiny tongue there

God is love, God is war
TV preacher tell me more
Lord redeem me am I pure?
Pure as pure as heaven
Sent you money sent you flowers
Could I worship you for hours
In whose hands are we anyway?

Go waiting for the stars
To come showering down
From Moscow to Mars
Universe falling down

You got to look real hard
Is it in your heart?
