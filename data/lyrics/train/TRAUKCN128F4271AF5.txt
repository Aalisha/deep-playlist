Here comes Suzy Snowflake
Dressed in a snow white gown
Tap, tap, tappin' at your windowpane
To tell you she's in town

Here comes Suzy Snowflake

Come out everyone and play with me
I haven't long to stay

If you wanna make a snowman
I'll help you make one, one, two, three
If you wanna take a sleigh ride
