Freedom is difficult to gain
And even then difficult to keep
They think you're going astray
And send the dogs to round you up like sheep
One famous pirate was told
As his trial came to the end
"You wouldn't die like a dog
If you had fought like a man"

Maybe I'm lucky
Or maybe I'm lucky
In another way
As fate has been good enough to me
The biggest treasure
That I could ever find
Is just enough happiness for me
