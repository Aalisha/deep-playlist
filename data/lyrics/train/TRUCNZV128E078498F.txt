Close the mockers world, planets in the same room
Sentimental girls, all of which had fame too
Already gone, oh but they can? t leave you
Fight their clinging on, fight but they can? t be you

All this time they? re wasting my rhymes
Do you know what it is makes you say those things
Or why you have a problem with what we bring
Suddenly we believe in more than just luck
It? s not meant to offend you, just for us
We know that you gotta feel important
But it? s a shame that your ignorance is all you? re flaunting
Your insecurity? s out when you say we got no shot
Met thousands like you and we know they won? t stop

What if I would wind it up, wind it up, what if I could?
 (Do you know a damn thing about what you are saying)
 (You think you? re in control but your gig? s about to fold)
