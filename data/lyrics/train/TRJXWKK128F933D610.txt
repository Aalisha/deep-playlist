I live in the middle of a combat zone
And I'm too scared to pick up the phone
I went to the market to fill up my heart
Now I'm in a coma, state of the art

It goes (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)
I ain't there (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)
This ain't fair (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)
I ain't scared (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)

I live out of state in a mobile home
I got my hands on a cellular phone
I fell into a ditch full of VCRs
Now I'm in a movie same as the star
It goes
