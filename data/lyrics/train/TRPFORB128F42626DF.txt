Late at night, that's the time I can't forget it
Sail the darkness but this ain't sleep
Heard the sound, could it be I got the message
But the message wasn't intended for me
Can't you see there's a madman working
He's putting in overtime
Too content with the sweet scent of denial
You're oblivious to the signs

It's a struggle for the reason
But it's the only thing I know

No surprise, here's more lies and you still are wailing
What the hell are you saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you're lying
Truth abuse, what's the use, it's not a game you're playing
Do you know what I'm saying
And you high high hiding with lie lie lying
...
