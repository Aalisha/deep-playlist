Pick me up, hose me down
I'm sorry boys about the dirty night clowns
Earth does break the things that we make
Like a model planes and cuppy cakes

I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year
I can't clear the leaves from here
They're too far under the brush this year

Let them be buried, buried alive
In their suits, in their ties
...
