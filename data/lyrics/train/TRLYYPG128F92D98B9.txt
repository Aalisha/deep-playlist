All things past and void of life
And all things yet to die and face the light
Must come before,
Kneel and be driven down
Before the lords of emptiness
Abysmal Gods abound.

Horror, anguish, fear and torture
Souls devoured at postmortem
Empty beings, power unrivaled
Dissolve existence, effortless control

Screams of suffering
...
