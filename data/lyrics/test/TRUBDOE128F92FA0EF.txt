Written by David Crosby

They want it all, they want it now
They want to get it and they don't care how
They want it all, they want it now
They want to get it and they don't care how

Want that mercedez, that gulf stream two
They want to get, get it from you
They want your life savings
And your mothers ring
They'd like to have everything

They want it all, they want it now
They want to get it and they don't care how
They want it all, they want it now
They want to get it and they don't care how

They want that mansion, and they want it full
Of wine and women, and political pull
They always have a president or two
That's how they get away with what they do
...
