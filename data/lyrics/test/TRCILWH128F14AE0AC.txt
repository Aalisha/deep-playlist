I can hear You calling
In a whisper You say so much
In a dream I'm falling
But I awaken within Your love

And I find You waiting
I find You, arms stretching open
My will is breaking
Lord, I've had enough, I'm giving it up

So let Your love
Take my heart make it strong
Take my life from now on
I'm running out of hope, running out of strength
So let Your love take over me

I have been unchanging
