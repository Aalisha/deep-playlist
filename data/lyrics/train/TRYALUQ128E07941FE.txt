Girl, I like what you're doin'
When you do what you do to me
Girl, I like what you're doin'
When you do what you do to me

Ah... the way you walk, hot sweet thing, sugar, sugar
It's just enough to set my soul on fire
I lose control just thinkin' 'bout your sweetness
Come take my love, you know I'm burning with desire

I don't wanna be with nobody
Nobody but you, sweet lady
No one else can love me, baby
No one can hold me like, love me like you, baby, yeah

Girl, I like what you're doin'
When you do what you do to me
Girl, I like what you're doin'
When you do what you do to me

Ah... when I'm with you, you make my mind go crazy
