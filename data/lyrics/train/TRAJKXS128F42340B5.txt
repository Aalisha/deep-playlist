So we meet again! And I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand
Yeah it's a look I used to know

Three long years and your favorite man
Is that any way to say hello?
And you hold me like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me

Oh, c'mon and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while
Oh, I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time

And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
...
