From the album best of donovan ii

I'm preachin' love
Straight from above
I know what to do, yes I do.
Well, I'm breathing love
Straight from above
I mean about what I said.
Well, I understand my congregation
Is made about the finer sex.
Well, I don't know about any segregation -
Anyone may read the text.
All I do
Is study you
In your natural habitat.
And as I do
I find that you
Are all worth saving at that.
