With all of my heart I know I could love you
But with all of my soul I'm driftin' away
And with all of my mind I know you can save me from
myself, and anything else

With all of my strength I wanna reach out for you
With every breath, call out your name
With every step I just want to turn around and say
Make it okay


But I'm so afriad you've forgiven one too mnay times
And I'm so afraid to give my heart again
