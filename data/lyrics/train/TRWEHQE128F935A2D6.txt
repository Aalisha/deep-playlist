Well... I got a woman, way over town
she's good to me, oh yeah
said I got a woman, way over town
she's good to me, oh yeah

She gives me money when I'm in need

I got a woman, way over town
she's good to me, oh yeah

She saves her loving, early in the morning
just for me, oh yeah
she saves her loving, early in the morning
