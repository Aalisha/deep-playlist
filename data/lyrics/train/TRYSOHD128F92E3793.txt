(Bill Anderson)

(God put a song in the heart of an angel)
(And softly she sang it to me.)

I get to thinking lots of times
About back when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up
Of the days both good and bad.

My overalls were hand-me-downs
My shoes were full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day
Through the rain, the sleet and the cold.

I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm
And seven hungry mouths to feed.
