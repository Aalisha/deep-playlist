Down the track this morning she did stroll
In an accident her foot got caught in a hole
I'm going to tell you the truth
Die for a touch of that cold hand
I'd be crying every time the Southern makes it's run

I'm going to buy them all
Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can
Trials and troubles are heavy for me

She's a ramblin' gal
Bound to leave her home
