Once more I'll say goodbye to you
Things happen, but we don't really know why.
If it's supposed to be like this,
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?
Oh, yeah

Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling the situation
Run away try to find that safe place you can hide
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like

Me! (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
All these things I hate revolve around Me! (Me)
Yeah! (Yeah)
Just back off before I snap
