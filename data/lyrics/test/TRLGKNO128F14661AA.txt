I keep trying to find a life
On my own apart from you
I am the king of excuses
I've got one for every selfish thing I do

Tell me what's going on inside of me
I despise my own behavior
This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a Savior

(CHORUS)
I wanna be in the Light
as You are in the Light
I wanna shine like the stars
in the Heavens
Oh, Lord be my light
and be my Salvation
'cause all I want is to be in the Light
All I want is to be in the Light

This disease of self runs through my blood (through my blood)
It's a cancer fatal to my soul
Every attempt on my behalf has failed
to bring this sickness under control
