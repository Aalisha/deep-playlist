Friends call me enemy 'cause they're a fucking joke
They'd better get their act together it's time that they awoke
I'm cast out by my relatives 'cause they don't want me around

The walls are closing in on me, I don't know what to do
Please tell me who is who, tell me who is who, tell me who is who
