Hey, hey, hey, tell me did you find your way?
There's a lot of things you've done I'd damn you for

From finger to finger, from head to toe
I do hope you're alright
And it's time to admit it's my fault
That we don't talk anymore, no

I'm winter cold in maiden fall
A beaten road where no one goes
And though I've left my post
The ones who meant the most
Wrote you a song, a stepping stone
