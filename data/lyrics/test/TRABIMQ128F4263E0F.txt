[Forte']

I encourage everyone to sing along...
Unh-huh, with the song...
Yo you can bump this, on every side of the compass
You know the crew, you can ask Grady
We not playin' baby
We just Nutzbaby
Can you dig it lady? yo...

I'm Powerful, man... (Powerful)
Yo, I'm Beautiful man...(Beautiful)
Yo, I'm Excellent man...(Excellent)
Come on man you really can't even dig it baby, come on now...
I'm...

[Chorus: Forte]

Powerful, Beautiful, Excellent!
You the little thing that I want!

Powerful, Beautiful, Excellent!
You the dime piece that I want!

Come on now again...
Powerful, Beautiful, Excellent!
You the little wiz that I want!

Powerful, Beautiful, Excellent!
It's too much iron that I want! (P.B.E.!)

[Verse One: Forte']
