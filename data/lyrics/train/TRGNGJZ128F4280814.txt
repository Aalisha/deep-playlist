You saw me lost in treading water
I looked pathetic and as helpless as a stinger without a bee
But underneath my presentation, yeah
I knew the walls were coming down
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me

To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey whatever it means to you
Know that everything moves in circles

I saw you standing in my headlights blink, blink, blink
I thought I'd run you down for the weight you left on me
