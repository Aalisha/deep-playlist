You think you know it all,
I see it in the way you're speaking,
The long words that you use,
It's starting to get irritating,
I've got the urge to knock you out,
And I can't handle this,
The ladder by your bedroom window
Really takes the piss

Step back take a look at where you're at,
You're just a raving Dawson's maniac...

You think that you know everything,
Take one step back and look at yourself.
I think you don't know anything,
All my friends think you're just a freak,
And you're just a Dawson's geek,
...
