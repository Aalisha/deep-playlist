I met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mold her (Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her? was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe, no tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said "Mi casa es su casa"
Meet me at my pad tomorow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says "What's that?"
I said "Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for"
She says "Yeah, but the average nigga I love to hit it raw"
And I said

I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga

No, I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no I'm not your average nigga

(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
other honey you was kickin' it to)
