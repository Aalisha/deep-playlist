Maybe it's been just one of those days
When I've had about as much as I can take
I've tried so hard, tried so hard to be good
But the world just threw it back in my face
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Lust in time for the next kick in the teeth
And I find one tiny bit of release
They'll try to cure me, like I'm some kind of fucking disease

Slammed by the wrecking ball once again
I'm driven into the concrete
I'm getting used to the taste of dust
But I'm still standing on my own two feet

This time I'll show them all
