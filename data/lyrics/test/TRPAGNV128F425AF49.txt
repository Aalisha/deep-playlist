The morning after
The only laughter
Echoes from the night before
I'm feeling broken
Words already spoken
Lay crumpled
And hurt on the floor

Except for those
That I should not have said
Guarded secrets
Locked inside my head
Oh, what did I tell
Precious gems entrusted to me
Those were struggling to be free
Uncontrolled
From my mouth they fell

Oh, secrets, some mine
Some his, some hers, secrets

The truth's so easy
'Cause i'm so lazy
...
