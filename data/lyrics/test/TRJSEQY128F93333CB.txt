I was starin a hole through CMT
Watchin everybody else who'd been waitin for me
I thought by now I'd been a household name
After all I had If Shania was mine
And though Bigger Than the Beatles got played all the time
Them funny videos why there's my claim to fame

Now all of a sudden there's a slew of comedians
Foxworthyâ€¦Bill Engvall and back comes Ray Stevens
Folks right there's some real competition
I started getting a little bit paranoid
Heck if this keeps up I'll be unemployed
Then out of the blue it came to me in a vision

CHORUS
