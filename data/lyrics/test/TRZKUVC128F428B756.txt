Nothing you can say,
Can take me away,
From my guy.
Nothing you could do,
'cause I'm stuck like glue,
To my guy.
I'm sticking to my guy,
Like a stamp to a letter,
Like birds of a feather,
We, stick together,
I can tell you from the start,
I can't be torn apart from my guy.

Nothing you could do,
Could make me be untrue,
To my guy.
(My Guy)
