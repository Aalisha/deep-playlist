I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you took my heart away
Wasted Love - return it back some day
Wasted Love
