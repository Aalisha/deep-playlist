Lookin back now well it makes me laugh,
we were growin our hair,
we were cuttin class,
knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
we were strikin matches just to watch em burn.

Listen to our music just a little too loud,
we were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,
headin to the rapids with some discount beer,
it was a long train tressel but we had no fear,
Man i don't know where the time goes
but it sure goes fast, just like that,
we were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
