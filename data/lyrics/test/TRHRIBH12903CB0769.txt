Settle in 'cause the road going west got drowned
A river's running through this town
It picks me up that for a few more days you'll stick around
'Cause alone I'm sick, get sad quick, hate no sound

We're inside while their cars are stalling, drying out with the raindrops falling down
And tonight, tonight you've opened up my world, so thank you
Smiling hard like my face was frozen, I figure out what I can't when you're not around
