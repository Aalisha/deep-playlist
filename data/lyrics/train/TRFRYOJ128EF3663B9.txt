I heard you were out tonight
I heard you were out tonight
I wanna see you there
I wanna meet you

You're going down tonight
You're going down tonight
I wanna feel you there
I wanna feel you

You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love you

You wanna wait till its right
I wanna do it tonight
I gotta see that you care
You gotta show me
