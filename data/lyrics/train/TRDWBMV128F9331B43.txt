If I could change my world
Things would be the same
There would still be love and pain
'Cause without it I would never change

If I took back all the loving that made me cry
Would I ever realize
That I'm growing from mistakes that I made
To make me change?

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves, no, no
Love never changes, love

Love, it will never go
Love, even when you go
It never leaves
Love never changes, love
