Breath of life
For which a man must grieve
Blood of love
Into my heart
Tonight we'll dream
A license to thrill

I'll sing you on girl
I'll make you high world
Lovers turn again to dreams
Oh tonight
A license to thrill

I hear voices
Screaming louder
Seem to break a spell
Watcha gonna do
I hear voices
SInging louder
Oh yeah oh yeah
