Put it to me straight,
Baby up and down
Move in a circle,
A-baby, 'round and 'round

Wiggle them hips, baby, side to side
Woo! and it's a crazy ride
About to shake, baby, one more time
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Feels so good, baby, just can't wait
Come on, baby, put it to me straight

Slow down woo, just a little bit
