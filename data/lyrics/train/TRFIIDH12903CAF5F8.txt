Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye
It could be for the last time and it's not right
"Don't let yourself get in over your head", he said
"Alone and far from home I'll find you"

Sad like a candle you burnt out
Spill the wax over the spaces left in place of angry words
Scream to be heard like you needed any more attention
Throw the bottle, break the door and disappear

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
...
