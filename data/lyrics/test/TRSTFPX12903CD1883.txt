Young screamers of the world unite, yow
And take a thing from this chance called life yeah
Hey we lead you down inside this hole
It's all in your head but you will never know
Fire the passion and the dream it lives
Take what you can, get what you give
Teenage screamers have a ball
Teenage screamers yeah

(?) is not a play
I still got the hunger to sieze the day
Shake off the chains you wear and have a plan
...
