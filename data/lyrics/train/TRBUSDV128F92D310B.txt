Everybody talkin' 'bout the seventh son
In the whole wide world there is only one And I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son I can tell your future, it will come to pass
I can do things to you make your heart feel glad
Look in the sky, predict the rain
Tell when a woman's got another man I'm the one, oh I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son I can talk these words that will sound so sweet
