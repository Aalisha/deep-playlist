You're a piece of work
I'm sorry if that's too judgmental
I don't want to be a jerk
Even if it's experimental

I don't think you even try
It's too late anyhow, now

You're too cool for love, baby
What makes you such hot stuff?
You're a little too cool for love, maybe
When push comes to shove
It's not that you're above it
But you just don't want any part of it
Baby what are you so scared of?

Is it somethin' in your past?
Or just a lack of presence
Time is passin' fast
Have you got enough effervescence?
