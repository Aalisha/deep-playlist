Look over yonder
What do you see?
The sun is a-risin'
Most definitely
A new day is comin', whoo-hoo
People are changin'
Ain't it beautiful, whoo-hoo
Crystal blue persuasion

Better get ready
Gonna see the light
Love, love is the answer, whoo-hoo
And that's all right
So don't you give up now, whoo-hoo
...
