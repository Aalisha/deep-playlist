What you tryin' to do for me?

Does it really matter, you to take a cab or a bus?
Trying to get to where I am 'cause you lust for me
We end up making love, tell me what'cha wanna do?
I just wanna be the one you come and give all your love
Make a nigga take all your love
I wanna show you things, give you things
It's all on you, you, you
If I could just have a minute
Baby, come and take a ride with me
Baby, won't you spend your life with me
All I want is you, you, you
I know you're right for me
Girl, you're everything I think I need

Said it's only right when you feel like
You're lonely
That you get with me
I got the kind of love you don't get tired of
And I put that there on everything

Baby, what'cha trying to do for me
Heard that you were looking for
A good lovin', not for sure
I know just what'cha came here for
Just trying to do for you
I'll spend all my loot for you
Tell me what'cha going to do
What? What'cha going to do?
What'cha trying to do for me?
