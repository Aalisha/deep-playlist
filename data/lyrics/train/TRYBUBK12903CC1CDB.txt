very fly very bry(??) skop dem coke

keep getting nothing done dumb dumb dumb
stuck in hundrum get stunned by stun gun
tongue undone
delivering gifts to the young ones

i can't help but think things, never ever thought before
shit wouldn't ever been created if i wasn't born
you don't feel sad (??)
but i like i came home cos i lost my (??)
