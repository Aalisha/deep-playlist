If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living
Why should I guess your size, a choice I've been given
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing

When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame
