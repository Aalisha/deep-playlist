Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that You will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in You

'Cause I'm broken
You know I need You now
Deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, know Your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

Yeah

I question why You chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
