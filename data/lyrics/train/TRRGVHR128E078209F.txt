You keep talkin', who you trying to kid?
Tryin' to keep your feelings hid
And I'm a prisoner of the past
It's so hard to make a good thing last

We know history
Over and over, will it repeat
Hey you, it's only me
No heart on my sleeve

Here we go, some things are inevitable
Don't we know, it could be so beautiful
It's too real
Situation flammable
