Here's your fertility,
wanting so badly to be crushed.
You leave it up to me,
to do the crushing.

Through new sincerity,
making a mockery of trust,
but if it's up to me,
bring on the new thing.

Pacific 2-3-1:
we're not careening off the rails.
Steady up to speed!

Another dream,
I'd learn to love.
The taste of bitter fictions,
the ring of contradictions,
sing to me.
