Welcome, it's a world of hate
Your life of buried dreams
Smothered, by the soils of fate

Welcome, to a world of pain
Bitterness your only wealth
The sands of time kicked in your face
Rubbed in your face

When aspirations are squashed
When life's chances are lost
When all hope is gone
When expectations are quashed
...
