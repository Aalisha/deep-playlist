I quit my job, ain't got no money
Seems I have to leave this town
Packed my bag, run to the station
Board the train that's eastward bound
Tell Mama and all the folks back home
Sometimes a man just feels he's got to make it alone
Tell Mama why I'm leavin' so soon
Because this life I live has got me sick through and through
Nothing to do, that's why I had to go
