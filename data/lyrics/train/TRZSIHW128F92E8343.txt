I met a guy in a west coast town, had four walls to bring him down.
And he sometimes speaks of you, the way that you want him to.
Late at night he'd reminisce, over the lips he used to kiss.
And his hand upon your hip, why don't you send him a line.
Cause I'm almost certain, That he's going crazy.

For two seconds of your love.

Two seconds of your love, Is all I need from you.
Two seconds of your time, that's enough to say we're through.
