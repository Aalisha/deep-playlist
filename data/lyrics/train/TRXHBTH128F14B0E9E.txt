You bring me joy
when I'm down
Oh so much joy,
When I lose my way your love comes smilin' on me.

I saw your face and then I knew
We would be friends.
I was so afraid but your eyes, they'd say "Come to me".

So I'd say to you
"Can we talk for a while?"
You'd say "it's alright"
When you love me, I smile
I feel your heart and you feel mine
You bring me joy.
