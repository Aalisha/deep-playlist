Put me in your suitcase
Let me help you pack
'Cause you're never coming back
No, you're never coming back

Cook me in your breakfast
And put me on your plate
'Cause you know I taste great
Yeah, you know I taste great

At the hop, it's greaseball heaven
With candy pants and Archie too

Put me in your dry dream
