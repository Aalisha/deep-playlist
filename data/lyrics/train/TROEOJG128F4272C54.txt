Your Mammy has been looking while Daddy stayed inside
And if you ever show up before the morning light
Everything that's said and done is not your point of view.
You stayed the whole night through with your friend Jeany -
Teenage Queenie.
You may be good looking but you don't know how to be -
Your wardrobe's always empty.
And no'one '11 ever see you've been growing for some time
