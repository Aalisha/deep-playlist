Ba da pa pa ba da pa pa... (x10)
Come here
Pretty please
Can you tell me where I am?
You
Won't you say something?
I need to get my bearings
I'm lost
And the shadows keep on changing

And I'm haunted
By the lives that I have loved
And actions I have hated
Ba da pa pa
I'm haunted
By the lives that wove the web
Inside my haunted head

Ba da pa pa ba da pa pa... (x6)

Don't cry
There's always a way
Here in November in this house of leaves
We'll pray
Please, I know it's hard to believe
...
