You can sue me for malpractice
every single time I jack this.
'cause the lower I go, the less I wanna know
about the truth that rips through me like a bullet.
You feel the trigger and then pull it and figure
I was an irritant of something irrelevant,
you could ignore by locking the door or more
switching over to another station.
A towering monument to disinformation
beaming out on the current frequency
propaganda written out on the pages daily.
I see the system as it crumbles before me,
propaganda written out on the pages daily.
I see the system as it crumbles before me,
I see the system as it dies.

All I check is all I see, here before me...
All I check is all I see, here before me...
All I check is all I see is this:
CONDITIONING.
