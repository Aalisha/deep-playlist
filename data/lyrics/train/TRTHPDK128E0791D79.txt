I remember it well, I was just about three
My dad said, "Son, what do you want to be?"
It didn't ring no bell, but I said
"Daddy, I'm a bit too young, what do you want from me?"

I'm much older now, I'm almost a man
I can do anything, you bet I can
Raise a family, now wouldn't that be grand
So sorry, but I got bigger plans

You can be anything in the world today
Like a preacher, a teacher, a baseball player
Those kind of things I just don't care
I want to represent the USA

(The American Dream)
Oh, as far as the eye oh say can you see
(I want to be)
I want to be the leader of the country

When I'm President
Things will be different
We'll start a new government
When I'm President

When I'm President
...
