Ooohh.
Sometimes, when i think about you boy,
i cant help myself
dont want nothing else,
In my life, i can feel what youre doing
and i know it aint right
but i cant help myself
theres nothing i can do
sometimes when i need you here
it hurts so bad
but i know its too late, theres no turning back
...
