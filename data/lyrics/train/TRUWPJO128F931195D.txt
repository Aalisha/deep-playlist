See that boy with that guitar
He's got skinny legs like I always wanted
A girlfreind in his car 'cause he's got
Skinny legs like I always wanted
Sister look at me again
You'd love me if I were as skinny as him

And see that boy with that guitar
He's got a shirt and tie like I always wanted
A girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
A shirt and tie like I always wanted
Sister look at me again
You'd love me if I were a dresser like him

And see that boy with that guitar
He's got a blue Toyota like I always wanted
A Japanese girl in his car
