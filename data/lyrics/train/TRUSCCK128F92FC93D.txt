And I ask myself "why?"
I can't understand why?
Sometimes a nigga wake up nah mean?
Wonder why he do the shit he do
Nah mean, it's life
We make the most out of it though
AIDS took so many brothers, yet we still going raw under covers
It's 2009, gotta think smarter,
stop being baby daddies and be fathers
I can't understand (why)
Some dudes vacate to the
Hamptons
knowing they seeds need Pampers
Wanna be a part of they life, instead they tricking different women
No room for a wife or a family (I can't understand why)
God got a million names
if we made it his image
does he see it the same
if we flesh of his flesh
Teardrops symbolizing the rain
I just can't understand (Why)
I get high to forget about the present
Why I'm not riding in the S6
