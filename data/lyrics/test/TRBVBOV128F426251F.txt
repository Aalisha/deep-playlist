One more midnight, her man is still gone
The nights move too slow
She tries to remember the heat of his touch
While listening to the Border Radio

She calls toll-free and requests an old song
Something they used to know
She prays to herself that wherever he is,
He's listening to the Border Radio

This song comes from nineteen sixty-two
Dedicated to a man who's gone
...
