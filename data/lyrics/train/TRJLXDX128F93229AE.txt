Say you will
Say you might
Could you stay a while
There is time
If I had known
I'd be walking home alone

Please won't you just calm down
Maybe we can talk this out
You haven't even heard my side of the story
She was a big mistake
I didn't mean to hesitate
My future's fallin in my hands
Why can't you understand?

They're out to get me
You've got to believe me

Say you will
Say you might
But please don't say goodbye tonight
Cause I had planned
That you try
Change your mind
