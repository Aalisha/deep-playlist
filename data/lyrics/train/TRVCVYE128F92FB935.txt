Closed my door, forgot my key
Missed my bus in the pouring rain
It's been the usual sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

Burnt my toast and lost your number
Cut my finger, spilled my beer
It's been the usual sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

I put your stockings in my purple boots
