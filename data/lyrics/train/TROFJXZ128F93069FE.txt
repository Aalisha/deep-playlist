These blue shoes seem to suit me well
When I feel like hell
As I do now that you're gone
Lost and lonely since you stopped caring
I've been wearing my new shoes
I've been wearing my blue shoes

You and I made the perfect pair
It don't seem fair
I loved you more than you know
Sorry I'm in such a sorry state
