White swords of blinding razor light
Blast round the Earth
Validating the immortal strength
Courage of the brave

From the aftermath of dust and flames
Resiltence soars
Upon the searching light's reflected blade
That guards and saves

The dark sky
The victims
The air is full of vengeance
From now on
Now mercy
The wrath of God reins on you

These monuments of power and steel
Carved in each soul
Stand forever indestructable
...
