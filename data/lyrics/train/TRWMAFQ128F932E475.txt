Check, check one... where is all my violins

My checks ain't bouncin' but they sure is shakin'
I ain't broke yet but I sure am breakin'
My BLT's just waitin' on my bacon
But heaven say, "Good Good Gracious"

There's too much month at the end of the money
Not enough dough at the end of the day
Don't know why I'm laughin' cuz it sure ain't funny
There's too much month at the end of the money

Swimin' in the red, Drownin' in the blues
...
