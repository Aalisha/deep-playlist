With Every Prayer I Can Get By
Every Day's Judgement Day and I'm Living Long
Straight Is the Gate to the Little House
My Name Is Faithful and I See My House


Not Far From the Town What's Been Going Down
We're Always Hearing All the News
You Got to Find Yourself If You Run Alone
Cause There's a Danger and There's a Fright


Won't Somebody Save Me From This World
