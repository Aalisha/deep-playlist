CHORUS
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again
You've underestimated, you've underestimated
You've underestimated me again

Hot shit, you thought I'd quite, and I'd just sit back in the corner
Mouth shut, had enough, held my tongue, can't wait no longer
I'll be seeing you one way of another
And when I do, gonna say that we should together never

Wink and a smile, it's been a while
With every day I'm for the better
...
