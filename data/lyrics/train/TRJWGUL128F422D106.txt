Oh you've got a smile like a sweet lovin' angel, oh baby
And you've got a heart that's made of pure gold, oh baby
You've given me so much that I'm grateful of such a faithful love
And it gets sweeter as the days go by, sweeter as the days go by

Oh I'd be lost without you baby, now don't ever leave me
