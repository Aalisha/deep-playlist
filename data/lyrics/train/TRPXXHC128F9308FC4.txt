Into my car
Comes the light of the setting sun
That lonely star
And the sound of the traffic hum.

How often am I here
Where I just disappear?
Maybe I'll wash away
Am I awake
Or am I asleep?

Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating
Somewhere in between.

Life is life
Dreams are dreams
And I'm floating
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between
Somewhere in between.
