it's the same old story
i've seen it all too many times
it's the fall from glory
that makes you feel

place your needle to the record, stab it down
it feels good to be the one to break the skin
so run with me now, look at me now
you're face down, tell yourself you're happy once again
right now you need this more than anything
but it's never enough, it's never enough for you

and it's the same old story
i've seen it all too many times
it's the fall from glory
that makes you feel alive
...
