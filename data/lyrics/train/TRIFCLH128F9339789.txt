I'm dragging my pen in a line on the page
Snow covered rooftops and broken down stages
Filling my head, can I please fill your heart?
With last summer's breakdown and this winter's jump start

Closing my eyes and dragging my feet
I'm praying for rainstorms and earthquakes nightly
What little remains, three years I have changed
How boring would life be if we all stayed the same?

Give me a touch
Give me sensation of anything
Hail to the kings and the queens
Of basement royalty

Let's roll our sleeves and taunt our defeat
...
