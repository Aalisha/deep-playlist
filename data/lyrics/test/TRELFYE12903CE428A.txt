You think you'll make it but you're wasting your time
You'd sell your sister just to have that last line
You've got to have it you don't care what you pay
Your body's dying but you like it this way
You feel the rush and now the high takes control
Your heart is pumping and you're needing some more
You just keep trying but you can't reach the sky
