Seems only just yesterday
I held you, and sang a song about your eyes
So perfect, and innocent, now failing
My God I'd rather die
Than live with you in pain

Resilient, transcendent, and fearless
I hope you realize just how strong you are
But I'm weak
I just don't know how I'll make it too far
For you I'll have to try
For you I'd give my life

And though it seems I can't go on
For you I'll be strong
...
