Listen, people, listen
I'm gonna sing you a song
About a man who lived good
But didn't live too long

He was born in Macon, Georgia
A poor boy without a dime
He found his way to Memphis
Singing These Arms Of Mine

(CHORUS)
Otis, Otis Redding was his name
Without his soulful singing
This old world won't be the same

Now he traveled on to Frisco
...
