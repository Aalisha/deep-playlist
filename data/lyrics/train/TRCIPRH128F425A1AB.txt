Baby, I know the story
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me, what's the secret

That you've been hiding
Who's gonna take my place
I should've seen it coming
I should have read the signs

Anyway... I guess it's over
Can't believe that I'm the Fool Again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the Fool Again

And I who thought you were my friend
How was I to know
You never told me
...
