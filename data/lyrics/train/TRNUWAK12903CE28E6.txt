well the high school kids are all fucked up
touching each other, oh my god
yeah 40 ounces is never enough
we wanna pass out in your yard, we wanna pass out
dressing in drag your best friend's clothes
while boys kiss boys in motel rooms
well just when we thought we were no longer lost
they kicked us out into the dirty streets of atlanta

so its friday night down on north avenue
where the gas station parking lot prostitutes
try to fix their hair in the rear-view mirrors
you know we're just trying to get to the club
and shake our asses
a caravan of kids, a big old mess
on the old wooden dock, yeah we're bored to death
got a bottle of wine and a fresh pack of smokes
we're gonna end up screaming about some midnight garage sale

so god, put down your gun can't you see we're dead?
god, put down your hand i'm not listening
but the microphone cut off, so we're screaming at the top of our lungs
you were born so fresh, a golden prize
