Take a chance and bet on something new from this irrelevant point of view
And drag me down into what you knew back when everything was said and done
And give me something more so I can hurry up and get bored
Don't leave me here tied down with no way out
Not knowing what's true means everything to you

'Cause I know the words have all been said
You're choking on every word you've spoken
...
