If you don't like what you see here
Nobody wants to take you prisoner
So let me make it nice and clear dear
The exit is right there
I don't mean to be rude dude
But you'd better change your attitude
(I don't like what I see here)

You're all invited to the party
You know you didn't have to come
No rotten apple's gonna spoil my funk

If you don't like what you see here
Get the funk out
We won't try to force feed you
Get the funk out

Pure poetry
Not bad, for a pasty faced white boy

You can't please everbody
But everybody cannot please me
(I don't like what I see here)
That's why I do what I want to
So why don't you do it to me, do it to me, hey
