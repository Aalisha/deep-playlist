Don't lose your head
I know the damage has been done
I know that I wasn't the wrong
I should have told you

What can I say?
Has probably been said
You probably wish that I was dead
And I don't blame you

You won't believe me, but ok
It wasn't meant to be this way
But at the end of the day
I still love you

I'll walk away so dry your eyes
Can I just apologize?
I know I hurt you
I didn't mean to

Look at the damage we've have done
Look at the damage
I thought you were the one
Look at the damage
...
