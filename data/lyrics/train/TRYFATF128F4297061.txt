My stupid tricks, do you know how to fight them?
You're being fooled, even worse than you know
It takes brains, are you sure that you got it?
Checked your reaction but it seemed too slow, as all

Cracking jokes I know you tried to ignore them
Still woke up with my laugh by your side
Caught you sleeping through the brightest of hours
You think you can avoid me after all those times you've tried

If we ever find out nothing surprises us anymore
 (Oh, when I'm walking, oh, when I'm talking)
If we ever go down there asking what we came here for
 (Oh, when I'm walking, oh, when I'm talking)
Our stupid tricks, oh

Scoring points, your silence made me the winner
You weren't there when I changed all the rules
