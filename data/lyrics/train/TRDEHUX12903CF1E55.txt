Come forth to defile the uncreated
Watching the path of ash and flame... Elysium devoured
Seraphim laughing at the sigh of your suffering
Consuming the meaning of his name

Deafame him... defile god's blessings
Rusting prayers still wait for completion

Taint the vision of purity... heaven ravaged
A revelation of impurity has awakened
Your inner being withers from a lifetime of devotion
Never to hear the endless cries of the faithful
The veil of lies is lifted from their blinded eyes

Ceaselessly devoured Elysium
Your truth was torn from the womb of mary
The word of god slowly dies

As dusk reveals the reamins of the kingdom
The structures of faith collapses before you
...
