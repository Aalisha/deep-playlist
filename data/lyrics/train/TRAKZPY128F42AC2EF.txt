? Well, you never buy me flowers
Hey, did you hear what I said?
I'll be dancing barefoot while you put the kids to bed"

Now, take a good look darlin'
At the smile on my face
It's been a long hard week and I'm ready to play

Well take a big whiff, honey
Of my sweet perfume
'Cause it's the only thing left of me in this room

I'm alright now
 (Got a little money and the gas tanks full)
Yeah, I'm alright now
...
