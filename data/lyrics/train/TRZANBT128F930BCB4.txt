I'm gonna have a good cry over nothin'
But a handful of cigarettes
I'm gonna leave the windows open
When I feel like gettin' dressed
I'm gonna think hard about leavin'
See if the afternoon can tell
I'm gonna let him lie there sleepin'
Then I'm gonna love him well

CHORUS
One mornin' gonna wake up
Far from this town where my body lies
But Sunday is nobody's business
Sunday is nobody's business
Tell all of the neighbors. Take back all your favors
And look away, Lord. Take down your eyes
