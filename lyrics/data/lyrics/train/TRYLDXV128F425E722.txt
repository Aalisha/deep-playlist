I told you I'd leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took every word to heart
'Cause I can't stand us bein' apart
Just to show how much I really miss ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone
Every light in house is on
...
