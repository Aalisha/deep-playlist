You're in my way
You crossed my line
You're in my face
You're on my case, you really waste my time.

Don't like your style
Don't like your sound
You talk too much
You got no touch, you drive it in the ground

I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you

Don't like your smile
Don't like your clothes
