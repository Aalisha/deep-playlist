You're everything I thought you never were
Ain't nothing like a thought you could have been

But still, you live inside of me,
so tell me how is that

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive

And though you break my heart you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you

'Cause I can't erase the times that you hurt me
and put tears on my face

And even now while I hate you

It pains me to say,
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't want a broken heart

Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna play that part

I know that I love you
But let me just say

I don't wanna love you
In no kind of way
