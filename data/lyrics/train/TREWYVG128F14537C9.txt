ask me where the worst place
could possibly be,
well I'm already there girl
guess how long it took
to set all my demons free
well I'm already there girl

I got my wake up call
when you shut that door
and it all becameclear to me

chorus:
all I want is you
I'm no longer confused
my life is not the same and I'm to blame
I need you babe
say this love won't die
give me one more try
