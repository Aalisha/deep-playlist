I Am A Simple Man (1991)
I dont know why you want to start with me, I aint n-nothing far as I can see
And Im worn out from working too hard, why dont you give me a break
I know that lately things aint been so good, Ill make it up just like I told you I would
But Im tired and I want to sit down, to ease this old backache

You say your having trouble figuring me, I dont believe Im such a mystery
Mmm baby what you get is what you see, I am a simple man
