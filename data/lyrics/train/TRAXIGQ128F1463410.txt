She got no money and she got no pride
Don't let her tell you she got nothing to hide
So full of passion is a wounded heart
I still remember when our love fell apart yeah

Just when you think she's loving you
She's gonna break your heart in two (she's just another heartbreaker)
Now she's walking away
I can't believe she's gone (she's just another heartbreaker)
And she's turning away
She breaks my heart in two
She breaks my heart

I never knew it could hurt so much
