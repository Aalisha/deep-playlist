A stranger to the night
I dwell in light, can not live without
Those healing beams make me go on
Peace is found inside
In flood or tide, winter spring summer fall
But when the sun is gone

And I fail to be
And this difference is a pain to bear
Although a mystery
I pray for it to end
But there's no response
And I fall again
My moral breaks
My limits I bend

Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
