don't tear me up or hold me down, trust yourself
enough to let me go the road, the road, the winding
road, keep on winding bringing me home to you
the winding road'll keep on winding, home to you,
winding home to you
winding home to you

i've burned bridges like deep water doesn't exist
i tried to live without
'cause i was scared of losing with
i never did forget you, i just can't seem to call
but i hope that you are doing well, i do wish that you
