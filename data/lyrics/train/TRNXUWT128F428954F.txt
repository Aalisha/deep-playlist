you call the shots
its in your face, you dont have to sweat
you call the shots, you learn to forget
what brought your stare

you call the shots
its in your face, you dont have to sweat
you call the shots, you learn to forget
its in your face, you know what youve got
you call the shots

you open your eyes and stare into mine
a stare like yours is hard to find,
its ultraviolet
you close your eyes and breathe
i feel your lips, you hit the switch
...
