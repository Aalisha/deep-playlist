TONGUE TIED
(Berry - Covay - Lewis)
WANDA JACKSON (CAPITOL LP CUT, 1960)

Oh, great good golly, he thrills me so
When the apple of my eye whispers in my ear
I get real speechless and I act so shy
And all I can say is neenie-neenie-ny
I get tongue tied, ooh
I get tongue tied, yeah
I go, well ah-ah-ah...
What I'm tryin' to say is
I love you, yeah!
