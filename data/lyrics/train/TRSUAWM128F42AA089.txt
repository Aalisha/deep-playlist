f I get on up and dance for you
Scream and shout like a witch will do
Would you give a little bit, ahaha
Give a little bit of attention to me

If I dress on up in fancy clothes
with a come on smile in a real nice pose
Would you give a little bit, ahaha
Give a little bit of attention to me
Yeah, baby, baby

Mmm-mmm, I'm tired of getting it through to you
It ain't no good, 'cause I just can't do enough
I can't do enough

Mmm-mmm, I'm always here when you wanna play
But then you walk away when I need your love
I need your love

I don't wanna be a star attraction
Just need some action
