Well there’s a great amount of strain
About getting on that train
Every day and every night

The only thing that makes it good
Is seeing my favourite sight
Prance and flutter stride down that green escalator, yeah

When I’m getting off my train
And my love is on my brain
Every day and every night

The only thing that makes it right
Is seeing my favorite sight
Crying in the night with the summer in her eyes tonight

Fantastic day today
