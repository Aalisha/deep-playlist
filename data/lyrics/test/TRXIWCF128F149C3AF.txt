I keep on backing losers
The beggars not the choosers
I keep on backing losers
The beggars not the choosers

How come they always find me
Then turn my head and blind me
With tales of how they need to start anew
They feed but never feed me
I just cater for the needy
Tending broken hearts is what i do
