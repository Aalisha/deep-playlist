Nature plays her little trick
Stop the clock and follow it
Way down inside your mind
Life rolls by, just keeping time
Doors will open, doors will close, I suppose
Tears may overflow
Still, there's something in the quiet of a heavy sigh
There's security in what you know you keep inside

Touch your skin and feel your bone
Mama says how much you've grown
The mirror wears a pretty face
Eyes that share a better place
You have the chance to break the lead
Don't use the gun you think you need
Love needs not to love your needs, can't you see
You caught me just in time
Then you take the key to free the door, now walk inside
I've been there for you, you reach for me, your heart beats wild

(Skeleton key)
(Skeleton key)
