There they are clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got her dirty little fingers
Bloodshot eyes are gone
Tell me I'm wrong

Twice as Hard was
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as Hard was
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

And no one will ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
A crime in the wink of an eye
