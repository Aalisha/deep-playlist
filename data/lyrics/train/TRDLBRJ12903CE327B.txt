Fly away on them old wings, black as they may be
Believin' what you leave behind is burnt up junk debris
And ever last undying soul resides at a hotel in Saint Marie
Fly away on them old wings, black as they may be

Fly away on them old wings, black as they may be
Shimmerin' like a Leslie and a Hammond B3
Or a shaking tambourine at a gospel jubilee
...
