There in the afterglow
My solo world in view
A glimpse beyond the world I know
An open door that I walk through?

And falling from the sky
A tear before the rain
But will it pass me by
Holding back again

A man possessed wings to fly
Beyond this space and time
The rythim of this heart of mine
Is beating like a battle cry

And if I let it go
Will strength provide relief
from fearful winds that blow -
only disbelief
