As far as I can see
To the end of my nose
One good clue for your being here
Would let me in what do you play for
Down in a thousand million
Worlds of nothing
What could ever be
Down from the mountain and
You feel you are a king
Right on
Right on
Who is witness in this room
Who is safe, who is safe
...
