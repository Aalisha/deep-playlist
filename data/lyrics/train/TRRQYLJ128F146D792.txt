I tried, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
I lied, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time

Just give us war, worn lipstick by the purifying flame

These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high explosive light

Just give us war, war, I've been calling you all week
for my shotgun
