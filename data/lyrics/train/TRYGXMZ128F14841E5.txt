Yeah, yeah, yeah

It seems to me that we don't always get along
If we are trying now, don't seem to try too long
Watching your neighbor seems to fill you with alarm
Just 'coz he's different now, don't mean he means you no harm

City living got us all pent up inside
When we have problems, seems we all just run and hide
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love have its say

I know you need it
Brother said, he needs it
Sister said, she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday

We seem to lose our way
Somehow got lead astray
That's why I'm here to stay
Gotta get back, get back to love

I know you need it
Brother said, he needs it
Sister said, she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday

We seem to lose our way
Somehow got lead astray
That's why I'm here to stay
Gotta get back to love

Trouble started when we don't communicate
