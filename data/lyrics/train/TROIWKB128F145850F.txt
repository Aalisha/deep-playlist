Cool headed one
Started out as fun
Now, it's sealed and delivered
Mercy's on the run

Started out to work it all out
But I couldn't fit the shoes
Oh well, hope there's an angel
Looking out and watching over 'cause

If love was a gun
Wouldn't hurt more that it's done, no
If love was a gun
If love was a gun

Hot headed one
What's done is done
Now, it's sealed and delivered
Mercy's on the run
