[Intro:]
Lightning, earthquake and thunder
Yay yay yay yay yay yay, yay yay yay yay yay!

[Verse 1:]
Life is here within; true love is all I bring
Now di dutty water children sip from di spring
Like wave Iyah swim, like message Iyah fling
Dem caan draw I out like nuh puppet pon a string
Yuh dutty livin, cho! get a lightnin
In this giddeon war I neva lose Iyah fi win
Warrior nuh shave nah trim
Tell di black woman she nah fi bleach har skin, hotter!

[Chorus:]
More life, more joy, and prosperity (More Prosperity)
Tell dem life, ain't no toy, di purety I live it in
Life goes on and on, on and on and on
Life a gwaan before di pagan born
Life goes on and on, on and on and on
All dem a many to plant their corn, yeah
