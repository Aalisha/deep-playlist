When I go, I think I'm gonna sew my name into all of your clothes
my girl, since you have always worn me well.
And there are too many animals on this ship, some of you i think will have to sink
but when it gets too much, you can only adjust.

And oh I am always thinking about you
and how you always wear me well.
You can't outgrow something sewn under your skin
so I will always wear you well.

And oh I am always thinking about you
I'm always thinking about you.

And Sunday evening always has a sense of something good about to end
I know, we hold our breaths for tomorrow. (Tomorrow.)
