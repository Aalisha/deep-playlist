In a westerly direction this car is my train
I'm driving and I'm wonderin what it is I'm runnin from again
I feel like an eighty year old man but I'm holdin on to twenty nine
And up ahead on that horizon is the California line.

Now I've had enough of this freedom of the road
Never was good with decisions
Least that's what I've been told

Up ahead a truck's carryin a wide load
A pre-fab house cut in half
Cute little front door and two windows
I'm not sure whether to cry or should I laugh
...
