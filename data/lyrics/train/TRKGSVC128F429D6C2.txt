there's no need for introductions
no dark corridors of fame
you won't find your fortune
you might find some pain
I wanna lie lie together
feels like our last embrace
in a world full of confusion
yeah, human race

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
is there anywhere better than here
you know these feelings I've found they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here

sometimes life seems to tear us apart
I don't wanna let you go
sometimes these feelings hit me
