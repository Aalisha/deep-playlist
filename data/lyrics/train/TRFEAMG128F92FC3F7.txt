She may be weary
Women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary
try a little tenderness

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating 
for things that she never, never, never possess
While she's there waiting
try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental
No, no, no
She has her grief and care
But it's a word that spoke so gentle
it makes it easier, easier to bear

You won't regret
...
