Come over to my garden, let's listen to the trees
Swaying to the rhythm set up by the breeze
I'd like to play you new songs that I wrote on my knees
And if you'd like to live here then we can cut some keys

The clothes you wore, you had to change
For you were getting bored
In studied rags, do slip straps show
Now you can't be ignored

Mister twentieth century man
You don't have to pretend that everything won't end
...
