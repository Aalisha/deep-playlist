Like a burned mark had left on your skin
- Never fades in time like a little sin
The past is haunting you and there is nothing you can do
You can stay in the dark but you can't leave your shadow

You feel the vanity of life
'Cos there is no talk without the giant
Your soul is searching the light
And you are defiant of the talk about the giant
...
