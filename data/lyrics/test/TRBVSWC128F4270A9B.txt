You're wondering if
I care about you
Is there some cause
That I should doubt you

Oh, I can see, boy
That you don't know me very well
Uh uh, you're so unsure

And you run here and there
To ask my feelings
Friends only guess
They can't say really, oh

Don't ask my neighbors
Don't ask the friends I hang around
(Never ask the friends I hang around)
Uh uh, don't be afraid
To come to me (come to me)
Don't ask my neighbors

Come to me (come to me)
