Selfish one why keep your love to yourself
Oh oh yeah
It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It seems like you built a fence
Around your heart
And afraid that sharing
Might tear it apart
And ya pass up every chance
At the start of romance oh
Oh oh oh oh Selfish one
Why keep your love in store
Oh oh yeah you think it's steel
That will keep forever more
Oh oh oh oh oh
