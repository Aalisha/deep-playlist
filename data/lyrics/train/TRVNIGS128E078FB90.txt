Now here's a little story that I like to contar
Pendejo que conozco who like to drogar
Started way back in the Mexico City
The year was '97, Molotov was the acclaiming

When a lot of brown nosing was goin' around
The cuahte was crazy, Valedores were down
He be there to the parties with the flashy clothes
He'd get a little drunken and powder up his nose

He'd be backstage at all the shows
He stopped to [Foreign content] to show off to all the hoes
Drugs will make you think wrong when you're on
You better step off before you get stepped on, boy

You better step off before you get stepped on
Runnin' up on you, runnin' up on you
...
