Can I scream?
Yeah!
We lack the motion to move to the new beat!
Whoo!
We lack the motion to move to the new beat!

It's here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it
If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads if we can
Adjust that 1000 dollar smile and behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings!

Whoo!

We lack the motion to move to the new beat!
Yeah!
We lack motion!

When the day is over the doors are locked on us
Cause money buys the access and we can't pay the cost
