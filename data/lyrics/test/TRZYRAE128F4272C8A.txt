Hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best

The temperature is risin' and exitement's in the air
Girls buy new bikinis and beauticians dye their hair
Health clubs are overcrowded with young men
Concerned and unhappy with conditions that they're in

So hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best
