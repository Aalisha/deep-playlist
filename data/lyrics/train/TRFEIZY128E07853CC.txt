you are the only road that leads me home
but i only take you when im lost
you are the only one who loves me in my weeknesses
but i only love you when im strong

you are the only water giving life
but i only drink you when i thirst
now that iv taken all these things for granted all this time
you'd think i get what i deserve

but you cared so much for me
that you gave your only son
and you'd do it all again
