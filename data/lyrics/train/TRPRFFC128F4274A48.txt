Yeah, yeah, yeah, G-Unit
My Polo on, check, my Dolce on, check
It's my crew and Polow Da Don
I get that kitty ma, yeah, I get that cash boo
Shake that kitty, girl, shake that ass hoe

Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
Well girl, I get pussy for free, I'm hittin? that

Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
But bitch, I get pussy for free, I'm hittin? that

Big boy Bentley, big boy semi
Niggaz wanna kill me, ain't worth nigga pennies
I drop a bag off and the Uz' will spray you
I need six pockets like a pool table

These hoes love me, these hoes love my pimpin?
They in the Phantom clickin? on they Cablevision
Dope, I got the Chef Boyardee bags
Coke, I got it runnin? out the rehab

Hoes like, "Why he actin? so Hollywood?
? Cause there's a chauffeur in his 300 Hollywood
I'm hot, no ghostwriter for the mic
Basically the Hollywood writer on strike, yeah

Ow, I need cash for my kitty cat
