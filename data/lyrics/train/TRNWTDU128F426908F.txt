I tear myself apart and I throw it on the ground
in front of you
Can't hide that I'm a social wreck
And though I sit within the wounds that one day
could destroy me
Sometimes it's hard to find my friends
As far us I can see it, I ain't got nothing else
And with all that you've taken from me, you car
answer that yourself
This twisted world can sometimes seem like it's
caving in around me
But I will not let it waste my mind
And though you're holding out on what lets me
know where I stand
Sometimes it makes it worse to know I ever trusted you
