My other half wants to run away with me
It's too hot and too fast
If you tell him once just let it be
We don't want love, no love

And this ain't real like the ghost on the sea
Shut up and smile cos you just cut into me
And this ain't real like the ghost on the sea
Shut up and smile cos you just cut into me
And this ain't real, and this ain't real
And this ain't real like the ghost on the sea
