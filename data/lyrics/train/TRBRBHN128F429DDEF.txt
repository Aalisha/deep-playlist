Can't help it
Girl can't help it
Oh, Baby
Can't help it
Girl can't help it
Oh, Baby
Can't help it

First time
That I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Played it cool
But I knew you knew
That cupid hit me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you

Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Oh, baby
Can't help it
Girl can't help it
Oh, no
Can't help it
Girl can't help it
Oh, how
Can't help it

Can't breathe
