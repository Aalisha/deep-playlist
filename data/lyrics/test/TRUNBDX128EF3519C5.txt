I cramp your style
With a bullet and a smile

Ugh, niggas on the D-l casin' me out
Truckin' my jewels, feelin' for the tools
When they come they gots to come correct
Because they know I catch wreck

A well known wild street vet
Step into the kill zone, baby, it's on
I pack the twin nine mills that'll lift your dome
Chrome pump with double eyed slots and such
A fully-auto Mac-dime that is sure to touch

Ya, bust you with the Desert Eagle
Street legal, move against my people
And the Ice gets evil
Hit you with the .44 Smith &Wesson

You're best to run 'cause my Tec eats pests
I got a glock with the laser, hot police taser
Step in real close, I hit your throat with the razor
You wanna live or die, it's your decision
Talk shit, you're dissin' I got you in my night vision
