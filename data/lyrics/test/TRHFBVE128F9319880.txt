Follow the light, the light is your guide
I am controller of Planet X
And I've invited you here
To discuss something that's very important

King Geedorah, take me to your leader
Quick to claim that he not no snake like, "Me neither"
They need to take a breather
He been rhyming longer than Sigmund the sea creature

Been on Saturday feature, pleased to meet cha'
And came to wake you up out the deep sleeper, like
He needed to stop before he caught the knee-drop
Even give you more zip-zip then ZZ Top

On full beers though shall not ball corners
Geedorah like, "One more step, and y'alls goners"
So-called rich, front if y'all wanna
When he spit electrics, don't be in y'all saunas

He only here to warn us what the plan is
...
