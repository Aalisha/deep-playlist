What did you say? Don't speak
You nailed down all your words on me
It felt like a blind guide
Leading me into quicksand
Fight fair, fight fair
But all you hear is noise
Fight fair. Fight fair!

I've earthed this seed so many times
Deeply held in this skin of bark
Branches made of ash and
Forests born aflame

Restless and full of poison
Shattered by a sea of dialogue
Rabid speech, like dogs with teeth
