Life on the margins
Little looks we have to steal
I want to run like vagrants hand in hand across this field
But I know the way you are as I could fall into the star

But it's not easy for everybody to fall in love

The city walls are reigning perilous and tall over dark chilling streets
No, it's not weakness when you fall
Oh it's just too much too fast
Crash that column into the wall

Don't let them tell you that there's a right way to fall in love

And she says

I want to live my life
Don't want to waste my time
I want a man who makes me feel like a woman

I used to be your biggest fan
I used to be your biggest fan
Now I find that you are slipping in my estimation

I used to be your biggest fan
I used to be your biggest fan
And now I know that you could never love someone like me

I used to run with my whiskers to the sun
I used to shed my weakness like a bullet sheds a gun
