Don't want to walk upon the water
Don't want to look across the waves
Instead of seeing hills of water

I just see markers on their graves

But in the fading of a season
To look across an empty sky
For a forgotten childhood reason
To once more wish that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god does he remember when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And in the night he sees the ocean
Carve its thoughts upon the shore
For in the way it was created
It can do this and nothing more
...
