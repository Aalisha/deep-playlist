We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion

Steve
See I know and you know that we ready
Let's go while I roll in my Chevy
Well I can see you wanna break me
And I can feel you wanna bring me down
First you gotta make me
Won't be easy coming in my town
Cause everybody in my city wanna be number one
They'll be only one that's standing at the end of this run 'cause

We ready
We ready
We ready
We ready

Because I'm a Champion
And I move like a Champion
Whoever will be a Champion
Born to be a Champion
