Every man should have the right to own a gun
Every man should have the right to shoot someone

Film stars and farmers still forcing opinions
Like TV politicians playing cowboys and indians
Uncle Sam sleeps with his horse, keeps his brain in his hat
With his trigger-happy patter, he'll rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat

Ride into the sun - the damage is done
