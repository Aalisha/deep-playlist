No man can decide my destiny!
Only I can decide my own fi me!
Why? 'Cause I'm a ole Gangalee.

How it go?!

I wanna be free from all chains, and all bondages and rope/
Free from all bars and all borders and dope/
Free to praise the Lord, becah mi nah praise di Pope/
So why now you ah wash your face with Babylon soap?/
Mi have whole wheap a faith, that mean mi have whole heap a hope/
Life ruff and hard, but wid it mi affi cope/
Some tek it 'pon di level and some slide down di slope/
Silent river run deep, but Gangalee have to float.

I was born to be free...
mmm, Man a ol' Gangalee, Gangalee.
mmm, Man a ol' Gangsta Lee, Gangsta Leeee.
And who have eyes, they will seeee.

Say, Me nuh come ya so fi joke, A me nuh come ya so fi laugh/
Me deya 'pon the mission an' me complete half/
Jah is my rod, of course He is my staff/
If you love di cow, you haffi accept the calf/
Coulda beat me likkle more, me get hard instead of soft/
Inequity worker, all ah work witchcraft/
Dem inject me body wit coal, but mi nah caugh/
Serious like all fifty judge, when all laugh/

I was born to be free...
