Broken on the inside, that? s what I used to say
Then I? d pack my bags, raise a white flag, drive away
I thought that? s what made me strong
But I was young, I was wrong

And I ain? t leaving any more
I? m not walking out that door
No more running away
I made up my mind to stay
I? m gonna stand my ground
Stare my demons down, I ain? t leaving

I don? t know when it happened
But I turned a corner somewhere on the road
And on this side of those stubborn years
Somehow I'm not so broken any more
...
