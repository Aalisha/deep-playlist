Sneaking, lurking inside the mist
Of our screaming ego
A lonely, a faded echo
Eagerly counting down the days
Until we're done with it all
Signalling an end to all of those hopeless dreams

'Cause we are so far behind... 

It's time to realise the here and the now
It is the moment we'll miss when we look inside
Searching for all that could've been
That could've been... 
...
