I spent nights, waiting for you
Staring out the window by my bed
These street lights
So unkind to shine upon the emptiness instead

I hang my head
I'm down but I'm not giving up on you just yet
Love, look at me now
What is this feeling people talk about?
Love, look at me now
You don’t know how long I’ve been holding out
For you love, look at me now

Some people take you for granted
Softly as you crept into their hearts
Not me though
