"The fear of blood tends to create fear for the flesh."
Since my birth, haunting visions
Have occurred to me
A strange power
Controlling my destiny
Burned in the fire
But my blackened soul has remained
My dark desire
Will infect this mortal plane
Lying here, left for dead
Bandaged and alone
A separate half I'll create
To undermine their throne
Feel your aggression
The taste of my hate inside of you
Feeds my obsession
Until the time you set me free
This was meant to be

[Chorus:]
Searching in my mind
Answers I seek to find
Oh to know the truth
Why my nightmares have
Come to life
