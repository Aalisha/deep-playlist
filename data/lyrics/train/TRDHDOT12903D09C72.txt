Throw stones, breaking bones
Then wonder why you run for cover
You fight the world from inside

Lay down, playing dead
Turn the pages, just another
Wasted day in your mind

You live to run away
But fear's the hardest act to follow
Let me let you in

Hold on another day
Face the truth, it's hard to swallow
It's time to begin
...
