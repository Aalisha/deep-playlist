You know it's taken me a long time, baby, to realize
How much you mean to me, I don't wanna lose you

Times are hard, my spirits are weak, oh yeah
Everything seems to be going wrong, outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real

No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight

I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't wanna lose you

Girl, I've got to have your sweet loving
'Cause without it, girl, I'll just lose my mind
