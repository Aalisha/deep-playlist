Calculate, cultivate, relegate
And chalk it up to the basic needs
Dissipate, isolate, these days
You can't run or believe all that you read

And all the kids with the down-low brainwaves
Holding up signs saying "guns kill, God saves"
And all in the form of a faceless newscast
Commercials that say live well but die fast

Even if you wanted to
Even if you could, oh, oh
You can't say no
Even if you wanted to
Even if you could, oh, oh
You can't say no

Calculate, cultive, elevated
...
