-Intro-

Woke up this morning - I looked around
I thought about my baby - I laid back down
Eyes running water - Head's in a spin
Why in the devil - Won't she come on in
For I'm crazy - Crazy 'bout this love of mine

I need my baby to hold and squeeze her tight
'til girl you know you're my light
Are you leaving me - Without saying goodbye
Love of mine, love of mine, Love of mine, love of mine
You're my light
