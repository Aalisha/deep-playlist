Hey! Kali Baby
(Chorus X2)
She got her backpack, and her lunch pale too
Cheatin when im sitting next to you/Milk would do her body good too, baby
She got her backpack, and I got a ruler for her too
Now im bout to take her back to school

I can tell she got that thing by the way that she walking (walking)
Love that dang a lang by the way that she talking (talking)
Baby got dem goodies, think she wanna do me,
Shes a floozy oozy wanna give it to me

She got her jack in the box plus shes a fox, might jump right off
If I get the toss, not gonna talk, lights come right off
She know im khali baby, mabe its unfair
I dont care, I just wanna lay in her hair
Give me your number, well rondevue at the after set
Im the one to stunt ya, one to if happen as of yet
Her bubble, gets me in trouble, you can call it too excel, ima call it double
Her back pack, she packed ejects em, she got me erect some
Now I just expect some, your bodies inviting me to a fight
