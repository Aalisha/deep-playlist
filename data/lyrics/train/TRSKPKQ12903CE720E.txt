It ain't no crime
Child, to speak your mind
And it sure ain't no sin
Not knowin' where to begin

So now it's time for you to make a stand
Oh, on your own
'Cuz lord knows a helping hand
Is all you've ever known

Yeah, not knowin' where you're goin'

It's so wrong, baby
To live your life in fear
There ain't no crime in movin' on
'Cuz things just can't stay here... no!

So now it's time for you to make a stand
Oh, on your own
'Cuz lord knows that if you can
You've got to get to where you're goin'
...
