All your sins are forgiven
In the name of Jesus in heaven... Ahhh

There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking... that God would understand
Satan take him to where you dwell
Satan take him to burn in hell

Always were a believer
You never thought of God as the Deceiver... Ahhh

There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking... that God would understand
...
