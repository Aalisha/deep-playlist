I'm holding on so tightly now,
My insides scream so loud.
They keep watching, watching me drown,
How did it come to this?

How did it come to this?
How did I know it was you?
It was a bad dream asphyxiated,

Watch me bleed.

The life support was cut,
The knot was too tight.

They push and pull me,
But they know they'll never win.

Throw it all away!
Throw it all away!
I keep on screaming but there's really nothing left to say!

So get away!
Just get away!
I keep on fighting but I can't keep going on this way!

I can't keep going, can't keep going on like this,
