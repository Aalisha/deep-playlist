You know, I worked the Big Packet show
In Fort Worth, Saturday night
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax
Before I caught another flight

So I decided to walk downtown
An' get myself a little fresh air
Before long, I found myself in front of a big Church
On the corner of the square

Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street
It wure was a beautiful sound
So I just walked up the steps
An' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down

But before I could, a young man walked over to me
An' said, "Excuse me, sir
But I can't let you in with that big black hat
Those jeans, that beard an' long hair‚Äù

So I just left, went back outside
Sat down on that curb
An' I thought to myself, that's the house of the Lord
That guy's got a hell of a nerve
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please
