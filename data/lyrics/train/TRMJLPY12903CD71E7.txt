In the midnight, moonlight hour
He's walking along that lonely lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise for me, with another guy
Well here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walking with her love, with her love, that's oh so fine
...
