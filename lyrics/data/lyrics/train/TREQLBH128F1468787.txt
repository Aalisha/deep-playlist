When's your birthday?
What's your middle name?
Who's youre hero?
What's your favorite flavor ice-cream?
Can you tell me, tell me this?

Are you Aries?
Are you on the cusp of Cancer?
Gonna get to know you better.
What? No it's not a quiz.

You can trust me now, we'll dig a little deeper.
Let's trade numbers let's trade beepers
So I can find you any place.
Hey, why are you looking at your watch?
We haven't had desert.
It's early, just 8: 30, only our first date.

I wanna know do you love me yet?
