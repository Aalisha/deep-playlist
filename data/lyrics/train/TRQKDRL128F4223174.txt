Here I am, in theï»¿ middle of an open hand, my feet are rooted and I upright stand, what's my plan, I feel the fingers closing in, I got enlightened by the chosen man, a little frightened by my foes and fans, I'm still recitin' doin' shows with bands, hold my can, knowing that I'll float again... Well, it's time to face the law, you shouldn't have done it, now I break it down to war, no time to run around, lurk into the hall, I'm gonna hunt'em down whether spring or fall!
