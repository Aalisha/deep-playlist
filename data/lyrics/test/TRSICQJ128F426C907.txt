Been on top of the world since about six months ago
Marking the first time I laid eyes on you
I lost all train of thought as I entered the room
Saw what looked like really good food
Then I saw you and so did you

I wanna wake up naked next to you
Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Kissing your clavicle
