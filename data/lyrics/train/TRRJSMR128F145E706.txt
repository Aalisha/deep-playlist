Let me tell you a story
About body and blood
There's a fire below
Deep in the river of love
Hey pretty mama I'm just trying to be polite
I wanna make you feel the rhythm of the river tonight
And when the story is over
You'll be satisfied

Honey, honey, honey don't you understand
To make you feel like a woman
Makes me feel like a man

Let me take you down to the river of love
Baby pull me under
Make me drown in your flood
Baptize my body in your river of love
...
