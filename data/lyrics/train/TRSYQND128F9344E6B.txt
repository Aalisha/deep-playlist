Everyone's had a day like yours,
But you should know that you're not alone,
'Cause we'll be there with you always,
Call us up. Let's go!

I know when I go low,
I know where I can go,
Find those who help me,
And I find out why so,
I know it's hard to know
Exactly where to go
I find my way so no one else
Can feel left out (?)
