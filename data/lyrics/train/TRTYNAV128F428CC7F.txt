Where will we go?
Where will we go?

Sign away all of my decisions
Tell me when I breed
Terminate opinions
I dream away my freedom to please you
Let them talk, so they feel importance
'Cause they don't mean a thing, this is my own dream
Why do you have to put this on me?

Where will we go?
I'm a mess
Where will we go?
I'm a mess
Where will we go?
Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
Live life the way that you want
Do what you wanna do
Where the fuck you wanna do it
Try hard to live your life
