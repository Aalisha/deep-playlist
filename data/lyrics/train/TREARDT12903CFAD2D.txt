They're little more than a few old guns
Handed down the line.
Once owned by my Nana and Papa,
But now they're mine
They've been all the way to Utah,

And up before the sun.
And now they're a part of me, I got the guns.

He died on the Corpus Christi Bay
When I was one.
A Christian man I barely knew,
