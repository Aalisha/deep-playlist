Baby, I've been watching from a distance
And everything it rings familiarly, mmm
But I can't imagine what you must be thinkin'
'Cuz she can never be what I can be

Oh, loneliness has really got you twisted
And there's so much your eyes don't even see, yeah
And then I laid my eyes upon your woman
And to my surprise I saw me lookin' at me
But how could you be with her?

Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I won't stand by and watch you pretend
So baby how could you?

Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I can't stand by and watch you pretend

We parted so that we could make it better
...
