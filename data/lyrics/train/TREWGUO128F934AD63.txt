Putting to dead those who oppose you
Will take control, no matter the cost
Bodies are mounting the carnage around you
At the last count, 10.000 have died

Taken by force
Controlled by fear
Death squad police of the right
Must stamp out subversion
Dissention, unrest
Those who oppose will meet death

Automatic weapons in hand
You say you're what the police want
