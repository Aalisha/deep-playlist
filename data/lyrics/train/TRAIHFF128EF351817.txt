Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
