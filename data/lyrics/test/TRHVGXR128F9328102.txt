Watch out boys look who's comin' down the street
Oh yeah she's a trouble maker, oh yeah she's a trouble maker
Here she comes walkin' on down the street
Look at her she looks so very sweet
But watch out she's a trouble maker
Watch out she's a heart breaker
She'll break your heart tear it apart
Have you heard she broke up Jerry & Joan
And found somebody new so Jerry's all alone
So watch out she's a trouble maker
