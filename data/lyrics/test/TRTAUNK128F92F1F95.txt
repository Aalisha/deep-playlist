Verse 1
When I think of special thoughts
I remember special feelings we shared
And when I think of special moments
Those were special times you told me you cared
B-section 1
When autumn comes the leaves will flow away
But I know right now Your love will always stay, oh
I know You will love me forever, hey
Don? t You know Your love can? t get any better, no, oh
Chorus
