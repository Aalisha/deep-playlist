I kill, kill, kill little girls.
I kill, kill, kill little girls.
It's such a thrill, thrill, thrill to the world
when i kill, kill, kill little girls.

Don't you come near me.
Don't you come close to me.
Why don't you fear me?
Don't dance so close to me.
Don't you come near me.
Don't you come close to me.
Because they wont let me stop now.

I hate, hate, hate what you are.
(You're so pretty when you fly right by.)
I hate, hate, hate what you are.
(I want to flush out your family line.)
Cuz i'm the punk rock, punk rock star!
(You're everything I despise.)
