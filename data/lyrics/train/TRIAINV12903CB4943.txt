Crest side dough

Call me that dope track native
The chopper I gots to fade it
When jectors they hit your block
And try to strip us as naked
Because they take it cause the games at a minimal
Shoutin the mile but you's a small time criminal
Coffee needs to back off me
Popin that game shit
You scrounging for what got me and my niggaz plat hits
Soon infiltrators
Claimin they some playaz
Check your shit its foggy fool
I'm slammin venezuelas
That got the taylor
And let me louie
He got that 50 shot uzzie by my Jacuzzi
95 and niggaz die for these hoojies
rollin wit killaz that got my back till the end
rather blast some berettas
or rone a gooch to tha pen
and police aint no problem
cause foo they smoking this shit
got so much pool at the station
I'm runnin hoes in them tricks
In the ghetto surround
Some suckas never saw a thousand
My cut touchin these streets
And u can hear the hearts poundin
Untouchable

[Chorus: x3]
