What you are
What you see
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
What you know
What you need
It don't matter to me
Just be faithful to me

When you kno-o-ow
Turning cold
When you kno-o-ow
Turning cold (turning cold, turning cold)

First I saw the letter
Heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away
What a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter
Heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away
What a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter
Heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away
What a waste, turning cold
First I saw the letter
Heard your secret code
Tellin' you walk away
What a waste, turning cold

What you say
