(harmonizing)

I have givin' up on You
Cause you have made it clear
You couldn't give a damn weather I was far I was near
But do you heard I gotta man and suddenly your here
The challenges must turn you on
Cause I know you ain't sincere
What we had is over even tho I thought we'd last
But somehow you just think that you can hold on to the past
You hated that I'm doin fine without you in my life
But I bet you'd never guessed that I'd be someone else's Wife

Then you see me but you love me then you leave me played your games
Yea you had your fun
Boy believe me
If you think I still need you Boy you're wrong
Cause you're not the 1 No (you're not the 1)

Lately in the mirror on the nights you decide to call
You're tellin me you want me back and that I am your all
