Steamy like a winter storm
Softer than the sharpest thorn
I held your hand and I was born
So explain your fury, you were never scorned
You make me feel, the way I felt
You can do me wrong babe
But make it feel, make it feel

Softly, softly
Show me you care
Easy, easy
Keep me right there
Would you ever
If I doubled dared
Hurt me harshly
Destroy me with care
