Tie all our memories on a string
I see them disperse in the wind
I thought I was so clear back then
bout how much you meant
meant everything

What makes three words so hard to say
what difference does admitting make
you walked and yet I could not speak
I wonder why, cause baby I

Chorus:
La la love you now with all my heart
that's all I've ever done
la la love you like I never before
