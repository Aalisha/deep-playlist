Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever, that's so hard to bear

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
And fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And I know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
...
