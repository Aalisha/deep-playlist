I never had a love to call my own
I was about to give up
And then you came along
Just to have your tender ways
Thrills me for days and days
I don't care what nobody says
I want you for always


You already come and took my heart and my soul
Now I want you to take full control
Yeah, I need the love that only you can give
If I can't have it, I don't want to live, no,
I never had a love so sweet
I never thought I'd be lucky enough to meet
