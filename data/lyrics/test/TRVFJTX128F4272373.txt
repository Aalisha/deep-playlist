Featuring Frankie Beverly
I guess the weekends over now and you'll have to make your way
We had a ball of dynamite right from the first day
Tell me that you'll call me just as soon as you get home
To pacify my heart while I'm alone
I don't like being alone
The things we did this time my love we've never done before
