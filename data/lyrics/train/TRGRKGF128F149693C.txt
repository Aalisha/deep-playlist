Intro:
Damn man, Your life must be so happy,
You've got your wife and some lovely kids,
As for me, I'm here trying to look a life

Chorus:
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do man
Lucky you, you've got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

Verse 1:
Ain't nothing funny, Sittin there makin fun of me
Just becuz you've got your kids and your honey
Yyou've got money
