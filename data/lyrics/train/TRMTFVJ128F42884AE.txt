There's a right or wrong to know for everything
And the truth is somewhere written in between
But there's always something missing in the dark
There you find the true condition of the heart

Well, I can visualize the pieces of a dream
And it's not as far away as it may seem
But if truth be told, it's you that holds the key
To the question that defines my destiny

I've been in love a time or two
I've seen the world but not with you
I wanna fly and spread my wings
Don't wanna cry, I wanna sing

I wanna live and take a chance
I'm not afraid to love again
I wanna fall, fall for you
And I want you to fall for me too
Me too, me too
