How did it start?
Well, I don't know
I just feel the craving

I see the flesh and it smells fresh and
It's just there for the taking
These little girls they made me feel so god damn exhilarated

I fill them up, I can't give it up
The pain that I'm just erasing
I tell my lies and I despise

Every second I'm with you
So I run away and you still stay
So what the fuck is with you?

Your feelings
I can't help but rape them
I'm sorry, I don't feel the same
