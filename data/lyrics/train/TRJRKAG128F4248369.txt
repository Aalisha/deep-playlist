You're the matador and I'm the bull
You're the brass key hole I fit into
You're the wind and I'm the weathervane
You're the strawberry blonde and I'm the grey

You're the light and I am the firefly
You're the star and I am the blackened sky

Tell me, yeah, sing your song
For my lonely soul
Tell me you sing your song
For my lonely soul
...
