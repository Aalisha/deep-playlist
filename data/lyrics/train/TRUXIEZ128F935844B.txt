Hey I'm just an old chunk of coal,
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day,
I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue pure perfect,
I'm gonna put a smile on ev'rybody's face.

I'm gonna kneel and pray ev'ry day,
Lest I should become vain along the way.
I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord,
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day.
