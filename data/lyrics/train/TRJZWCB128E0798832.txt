I don't know what your looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up and spread me all around
In the dust of the dead of time
And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

And I'm losing my favorite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby
