They used to call me Bobo, man
[J-Zone scratches]
R.A
He's rugged!
Alright friends, on your feebles

[R.A.- Verse One]
Yo, see how they go, hip hop R-A-Hay-Ohh
I'm a Special Ed. student, with an A+ flow
Used to call me Bobo, Buzzbee Burbley
Bronson,?, Disco Derby
I'm a modern day Ozzy Osbourne
Bitin bats heads off and bustin nuts in your pop corn
Wonderin how this ugly motherfucker got on
The whole white trash nation, rock rock on
Now wait a minute, let's bring it back a little bit
When you first started rappin, you was all on my dick
Yeah, you went multiplatinum, but you bit my shit
What you rappin is my life, you ain't live that shit
See all the others say I'm twisted, and I'm over the edge
I'ma whole crew they stay? off, and stick in their heads
Sledgehammer, break pay phones, still calling
Stay out the trouble, stay home, Rugged Man, J-Zone

[Chorus-R.A. sings]
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
[It's time for a showdown, between you and I]
You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy cause we brawl
[If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat]
Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor
[Come on sucker, let's get on]
