Deep inside the folds of a carefully constructed tomb
Dreams of turned back time in the safety of a second room

Retreat to isolation
Build up the walls and lick the wounds
This fear to fail fear to feel
Comes a bullet numb and alone

There was one, there was one

This quiet
Reaching out
Disquieter
And pulling back again
...
