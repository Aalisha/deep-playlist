I watched you leaving and
never tried to get you to stay
Somehow I talked myself into
believing that
It s just another game we play

But the moment you re gone
the heartache begins
Like an ocean of sorrow that I
keep drowning in
Should I reach for the phone or
wait for your call
I don t care who was wrong I
won t go there at all

CHORUS
