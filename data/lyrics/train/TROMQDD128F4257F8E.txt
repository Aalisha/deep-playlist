Why must I stand on my toes? 
Perfect smile and skin tight clothes 
Cinched waist, no cunt to piss with 
A stamp on my ass 
Little girls worship me, 
And that'll never come to pass 
But at last... 
I'm turning over a new loaf 
I'm eating dry toast 
I'm wearing slippers on my flat feet, 
I have cellulite 
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't smiling 
Bitterness Barbie, she ain't styling 
Bitterness Barbie, boobs are sagging 
What if I had a mastectomy? 
Would they buy a one titted barbie? 
...
