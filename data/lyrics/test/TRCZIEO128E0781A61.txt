I drove all over Hollywood
Looking at the stars
First I ate my Milky Way
And then I ate my Mars
But sucking on a Galaxy
I noticed something pretty bizarre
There's not a lot of people there,
Just an awful lot of cars, check it out

Stale pulp culture take it away
True pulp culture help to redefine it
Old pulp culture day upon day
Young pulp culture serve to undermine it
Sham pulp culture buried in time
True pulp culture there to be plundered
Same pulp culture year upon year
Hey! pulp culture live to be a hundred...
