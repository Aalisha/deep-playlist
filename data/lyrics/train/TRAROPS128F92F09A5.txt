Am I that easy to forget?

You say you've found somebody new, but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away, forget the love I had for you
Yes, I could find somebody too, but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret? Am I that easy to forget?
(Am I that easy to forget?)
