Girl, you could explain for 1, 000 days.
But I'll never work out why we're throwing it all away.
You say you're still in love, you just need more space.
I don't have the strength to leave you but I don't want to wait.
I'm not trying to bring you down.
I'm only calling you because I thought you should know I

Can't get used to life without you.
Close my eyes, see your face.
And nothing seems to ease pain.
And I just can't get through these nights without you.
Close my eyes, see your face.
I only have myself to blame.

Girl, lying alone, I feel out of place
It's all that I can do to get up and turn the page.
Every spin of the hands is 1, 000 days.
...
