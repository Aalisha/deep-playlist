Take off your shoes
sit on the floor

I'll make us a coffee he'll keep you warm.
Remember the times we couldn't afford
Even the bare necessities
but we made it somehow.
And I love you
yes I love you.
Tell me do you love me
do you love me still.
They tried to keep me down
you made me strong
And I love you
...
