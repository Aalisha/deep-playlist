Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
it's a good life

I wanna stand around and beg you
just don't say no
no no
no no.
I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it 
what I'm doing to you
And I know what I'm doing
I'll be doing what you want to me to do.

Love is shining
life is thriving in the good life
good life

Good life
good life
good life
good life

in the good life
good life.

A feeling that you get from the good life.
Once you get the good life feeling

Let me tell you no one can take it away
