A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat
He took a break from running but he wasn't done yet
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town

Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life
