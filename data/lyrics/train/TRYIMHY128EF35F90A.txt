today no wonder youre feeling sad 
after last nights cigarette and yesterdays bottle of jack 
you said you was gonna change 
but as usual nothing does 
you stay the same 

and im fed up 
of people walking all over me 
and ive had enough 
of you abusing my genorosity 
from now on im not letting you take the pee 
cos im fed up 
of people walking all over me 
...
