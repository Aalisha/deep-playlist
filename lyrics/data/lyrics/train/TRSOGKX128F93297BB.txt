Years of plead, behind the walls
Chambers and vaults, Scenes of fright
Unspoken Words, in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands

Gilles De Ray's... the perverted son
The holy man... hanged by nobility
Into The Crypts of Rays...

Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his repulsive sexual lust

Gilles De Ray's... the perverted son
...
