It's alright, can I see you later tonight?
You're so fine, younger than the others, it's not right
'Cause you know I'm restless to you, how you get me all confused
You nearly pull me under, you're my 20 year old lover

And I can hear what they're sayin'
When I'm talkin' to you
 (Feelin' alright)
I don't know what I'm feelin'
But I know it's somethin' I dig
 (Feelin' alright)

I don't know what I'm feelin'
Just a little more than I should
 (Feelin' alright)

Now some boys got so little to say but a lot on their minds
So maybe I c-c-come a little late but you're right on time
Oh yeah, I need to let you know, don't be so quick on the draw
You gotta warm me up before you rub me raw

And I can hear what they're sayin'
When I'm talkin' to you
 (Feelin' alright)
