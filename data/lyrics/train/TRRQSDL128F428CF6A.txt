The ice is thin come on dive in
underneath my lucid skin.
The cold is lost, forgotten.

Hours pass days pass time stands still
light gets dark and darkness fills
my secret heart forbidden...

I think you worried for me then
the subtle ways that I'd give in
but I know you liked the show.

Tied down to this bed of shame
you tried to move around the pain
...
