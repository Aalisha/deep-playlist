He was sitting beside me in the passenger seat
As I looked through the windshield at the quiet little street
He was smiling so proud as he gave me the key
But inside I knew he was as nervous as me

And I said daddy oh daddy are you sure I know how
Are you sure that I'm ready to drive this car now
He said I'm right here beside you and you're gonna do fine
All you gotta do is keep it between the lines

'Cause it's a long narrow road
Only the good Lord knows where it leads in the end but you got to begin
So keep your hands on the wheel believe in the things that are real
