(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
My roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
Oh yes, my roof's got a hole in it and I might drown
There was a crooked man and he had a crooked smile
Had a crooked sixpence and he walked a crooked mile
Had a crooked cat and he had a crooked mouse
They all lived together in a crooked little house
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
Oh, no, don't let the rain come down
(Ah, ah)
