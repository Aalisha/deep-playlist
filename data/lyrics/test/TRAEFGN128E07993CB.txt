I can be taught but I'm not learning
Over and over, I lose
I make mistakes to get so sorry
I can't unwind like yarn from a spool

I'm a little shaky, gotta learn how to fight
The moon shines on the boulevard, baby, let's ride
If you gotta look back, don't look down
Our love went cold and turned to ice

It's hard to see the ground
