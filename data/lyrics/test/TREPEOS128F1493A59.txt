(M. Riperton - R. Rudolph - M. Henderson)

Hey there everybody, out there gettin down
Steppin with the fashions, throwin love around
You're hustlin for money, you playin' the big man's game
Going around in circles, you don't know where
Ah, you're smilin' through the pain

Oh, such a strange affair
Don't it blow your mind, mon cher
