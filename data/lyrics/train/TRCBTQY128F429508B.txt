Get Away

You ask me how I stay the same
After I'd seen everything
Could be the company I keep
You say I've got something you need
But what I have I just can't sell ya
Cause my experience runs deep
You wanna be a brave man
But you just can't face your fear
You only know what you can do

You say get away from me
Just get away from me
Just get away from me
Cause I might tell you something

You think the world owes you a debt
And they should hand you your success
But you won't find it on tv
