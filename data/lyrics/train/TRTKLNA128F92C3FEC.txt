You wanna know why I lost you?
You wanna know what's wrong with you?
But nothing's wrong girl, you're feeling so tough
Just one girl for me and that ain't enough

I gotta love them all babe, not just a few
I gotta love those pretty girls, it's what I gotta do
Oh yeah, let's talk about girls (let's talk about girls)
I said yeah (let's talk about girls)
Let's talk about girls (let's talk about girls)
Girls that beg for more

See the pretty girl there, just walking by
Turns me on when she gives me the eye
There goes another, looking so fine
I won't be happy till I make her mine

I gotta love them all babe, not just a few
I gotta love those pretty girls, it's what I gotta do
Oh yeah, let's talk about girls (let's talk about girls)
