Come on feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild!
Wild, wild, wild!

So you think I got an evil mind
I'll tell you honey
I don't know why

I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
it makes me money
I don't know why

I don't know why, anymore
Oh no
So come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Come on, feel the noise
Girls rock your boys

We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby
So you see I got a funny face
