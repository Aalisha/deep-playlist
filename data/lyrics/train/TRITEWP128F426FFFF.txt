God has condemned his creation; forever perished
From the light disemboweled carcasses, drape the
Altars of hate they are left... to asphyxiate...
A pity existence... for what was once so holy

The horizons they suffer the dammed
Oppressed suffering, blood fills the heavens
Testament of the divine rapture blessed prayers...
For the murdered centuries... of defiled faith; decay before the abomination
