Don't speak of safe Messiahs
A failure of the Modern Man
To the centre of all life's desires
As a whole not an also ran
Love in a hollow field
Break the image of your father's son
Drawn to an inner feel
He was thought of as the only one
He was thought of as the only one

He no longer denies
All the failures of the Modern Man
