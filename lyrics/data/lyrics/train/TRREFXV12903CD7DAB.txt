[Altus/White]

Masses form into religion to fulfill their lives
Seeking answers in the bible, hear their helpless cries 
Mindlessly, no thought, they follow false prophets of the flesh 
Depend on the spirit of the One to grant their every wish

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's not too late to change your fate 
You must control your own mind 
You're the only one that can release you 
It's yourself you've got to find
