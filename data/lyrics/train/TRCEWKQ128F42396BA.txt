So small, oh so small are we
By we I mean all humanity
Endless universe out in front of me
Some say earth’s a tiny obscurity

Maybe in size, but if your wise
And close your eyes
Lose all you’re guise

Part of the deal
Is do not conceal
That we can feel
This is all real

The stars can’t feel a lovers touch
The kiss that makes your body rush
Embrace your sleeping sweetheart with hush
And the words I love you mean so much

Above in the sky
Diamond lights fly
...
