Thursday night, everything's fine
Except you've got that look in your eye
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring
You're thinking of something to say
You'll go along with it then drop it
And humiliate me in front of our friends

Then I'll use that voice that you find annoying
And say something like
Yeah, intelligent input darling
Why don't you just have another beer then?
Then you'll call me a bitch
And everyone we're with will be embarrassed
And I won't give a shit

My fingertips are holding onto
The cracks in our foundation
And I know that I should let go but I can't
And every time we fight
I know it's not right
Every time that you're upset
And I smile
I know I should forget but I can't
