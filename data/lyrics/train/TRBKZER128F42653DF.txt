(feat. Playa Fly)

[Gangsta Blac]
Peepin' down and in the cut
Comin' in with gangsta what?
To back it up this time I be cuz S.P.V. just ain't enough
Tuck it 'fore it's took away
Panic with no words to say
Silent then come violent, wildin', pokin' product round my way
Known for burnin' up the road
Peelin' til' I'm ridin' rims
In the cut like seat belts you can't find so don't fuck with him
Deep down in the dirty heard me? Get me some and get me out
Ballin', fallin', callin', haulin' ass all through the North and South
Pack you up to sit you down
Quick enough to swipe a smile
Drano, cane-o, mastermind be truckin', gangstas speakin' now
