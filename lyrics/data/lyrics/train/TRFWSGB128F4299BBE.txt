Speak of heroes
You're swift to nominate them
Oh, darling be a sacrificial lamb
Oh, poor boys fighting peasants in foreign lands

How loudly you praise them
Oh, but where were you then?
Off dancing with your debutante
Her skin is soft and warm
But her eyes are cold and dead

It serves the greedy well
To say men's hearts are dark
But I believe there'll be a light that shines
Which now is just a spark

No gods, no masters
...
