You are Selene, the moon in heaven
You are Persephone, Queen of the Underworld
Hecate... darkness and terror of the night
Hecate... oh, the crossroads are thine
You are Diana, you are the hunter of souls
The dogs are howling, we dogs know when you approach

Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight, oh let us ride

[solo: Shermann]

At the crossroads, they buried criminals and suicides
At the crossroads, any traveller could lose a life
A suitable place, for making a pact with the Devil
