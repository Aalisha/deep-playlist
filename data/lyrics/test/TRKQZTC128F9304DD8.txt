Downstream the river
The boat is moving on
Passing fields of silence
Long time gone
A paragon of beauty
A sacred, holy ground
Gazing at in wonder
Safe and sound

Eternal bliss is reaching in
The valleys of the soul
The spirits of your fondest dreams are here
The purple patch of memories
In ruby letters carved
The archway of forgotten worlds appear

(chorus)
