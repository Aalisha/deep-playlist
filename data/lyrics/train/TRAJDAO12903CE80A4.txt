Like a vicious thorn
Vicious thorn

Is there something lost in me like a vicious thorn?
Is she tearing ribbons so the pain will be adorned?
Have I wrapped it all nicely in the soul trace of my eyes?
Do you even care your candle is burning out of my disguise?

Now I cradle everything
You're not coming back, you're not coming (coming back)
Now I cradle everything
In arms winds could crack, you're not coming back
