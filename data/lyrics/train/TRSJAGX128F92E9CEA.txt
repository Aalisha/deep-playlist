I'm sick of walking in your bad dreams
I'm tired of talking up your dancings
It's time for me to take a ride and turn it around
It's time for you to realize that

I'm gonna scream it in your mainstream
I'm gonna take it with the main street
I'm gonna put it in your mind and turn it around
I'm gonna draw it on the line

It's coming around, it's coming around
It's coming, no doubt, I'm gonna see you on the other side
Coming around, it's coming around
It's coming, no doubt

I'm sick of walking on your land mines
I'm sick of falling on your trip lines
I'm gonna take another ride and turn it around
It's time for you to realize that
