Through endless forests in the night I walked alone
And there I found the prophecy carved in stone:
"To find the cure for the man who is your lord,
Use the magic sword"

So take your horse and ride it fast across the land
To find the city buried deep beneath the sand
Search for a man who can bless your heart with steel
It's the key to kill the beast

The ride is long, be brave and strong
You are the one, strong as the sun

I'd give my life for my beliefs
...
