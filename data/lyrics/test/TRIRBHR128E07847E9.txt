I wouldn't wanna go home on a night like this
When I find out that some of the past has been missed
And the light in the window has burned it's fuse
I pull everything inwards but everything's loose

Everything inwards, but everything's loose
Everything inwards, but everything's loose

I wouldn't wanna stay out with news like this
All the engines too loud all the pavements hiss
How the scouts in the stairwell will meet again?
