Ba ba ba ba bada ba!

We make our own mythologies
Yr maps won't let us down again
Yr legends all played out
Yr keeping some dark secrets,
But you talk in your sleep

We make our own mythologies
All gangster scenes and bullet scars
Yr fashion's three months late
If I had the guts I promise I would...

Cut the powerlines
Tape the letterbox shut
...
