Matt: Weird here is normal; weird here is the extreme somewhere else.

I hate you, ("love is a strong word" in reverse)love is a strong word

Try again, try again, try again, try again, try again, try again

When Hollywood runs out of Indians
When the bar stars melt and their golden hair turns to glass
When Hollywood runs out of Indians
When the bubble bursts and the first are come for by the last

There's something in the way you move
That makes me catch a cold
There's something in your "too cool for school"
When you slide up and down my pole
There's something in the way you look
That only casts a shadow
When Hollywood runs out of Indians
Only the Indians will know

Try again, try again

A kick in the head, pass it around
Begging for a bed, pass it around
Pass it around

And I'd say what you'd say
But it makes me feel nothing
There's a car waiting
...
