Save me, save me

I'm goin' down, down for the third time
I'm goin' down, down for the third time
Drownin' in tears from my heart that's hurtin'
Drownin' in tears from a love that's uncertain

I'm lost in a world without your love
A sea of emptiness
The love we knew is bein' washed away
Don't think I can last, my heart is sinkin' fast

I'm goin' down, down for the third time
Tryin' to hold on to a love that's gone
Drownin' in the love that keeps me breathin'
...
