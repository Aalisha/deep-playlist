Slow down, lately lives are moving too fast
Put your money down and we'll make it last
By dawn we'll be out of here

The marching band play for the families
Through the streets, beautiful symphonies
Let's walk through the park while the trees are still there

And the midnight choir, they sing
They sing a hymn we used to believe in
[Incomprehensible]
But it's all we've got
