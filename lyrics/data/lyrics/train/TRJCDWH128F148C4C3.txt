Well, we can't take it this week
And her friends don't want another speech
Hoping for a better day to hear what she's got to say

But now your tryin' to be some, now you got to do some
Wanna be someone who cow wow wows
But you thinkin' about the times you did, they took every ounce
When it sure got to be a shame when you start to scream and shout
You got to contradict all those times you were butterflyin' about
