If there was a single day I could live
A single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away

The blood's on the wall
So you might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains
Commit to forgetting it

You're better off empty and blank
Than left with a single pathetic trace of this
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
...
