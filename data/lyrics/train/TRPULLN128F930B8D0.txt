There's a girl downtown with freckles on her nose Pencils in her pocket and ketchup on her clothes She's a real nice girl, pretty as a plate The boys call her Katie when they ask her on a date And who knows Katie?
Maybe you could be the one


There's a boy outside standin' in the rain His hands are in his pockets he's a wonderin' why he came He's a real nice boy, slower than the fall The girls call him Billy if there callin' him at all And who knows Billy?
Maybe you could be the one

Chorus:
But hearts don't fly
And words don't sing
Boys like you can't buy no ring
...
