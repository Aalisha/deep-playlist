Oh, fuck it all!

Sick of being sick and tired, sick of understanding
Tired of feeling sick to my stomach
Demons inside command me
They're saying crush it, break it, smash it

Fuckin' kill 'em all!
Laugh as it falls away
I won't dodge another silver bullet
Just to save a little face
I want you to know, I want you to see

I want you to look beyond your own eyes
Past your afflictions
How many people really care?
