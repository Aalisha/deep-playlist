Your mind can play tricks
Makes you what you want to be
Just like superheroes
You saw them on TV

Coast to coast, wall to wall
Got to go, duty calls
Here I am (here I am)
Superman, Lois Lane
Saved the world, back again
Here I am

In my old, red saloon
I'm a knight in shining armour
If I were asleep, man
I couldn't be much calmer

Hit the road, on the run
