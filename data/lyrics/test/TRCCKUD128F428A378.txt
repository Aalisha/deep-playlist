(Aimee Mayo/Chris Lindsey)

Time is a shadow
Life is a dream
The only thing that seems real baby
Is you and me
I'd think someday I'd feel this way
Now it's hard to believe
You touch my soul and I lost control
Whats happened to me

I'm falling over and over and over and over and over again
Just kiss me over and over and over and over and over again
I want you over and over and over and over and over again
