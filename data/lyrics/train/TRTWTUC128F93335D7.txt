And As the Conversation Drags I Try to Think of Something Quickly
'cause If I Don't Move Too Fast She'll Be Gne and I'll Be Wondering Why
I Took So Many Trips I Sang Too Many Songs
I Said One Too Many Times I Won't Be Gone That Long

My Little Lady She's So Glad So Glad I'm Sad
We Were Happy Together
And With a Ticket in Her Hand That Hand Sweet Hand
I Think I'll Lose Her Forever
