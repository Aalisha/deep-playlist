Dear God
It's me again down here
Don't wanna sound insincere
I'm lost
Sometimes you're so unclear
What can I do?
I'm feeling so far from you

Frustrated
Irritated
Disconnected from it all
The weight of the world
Has pushed me to the wall

I surrender to you
I'm giving in
Come take me
Save me
I want to start again
