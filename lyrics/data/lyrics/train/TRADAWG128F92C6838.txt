Can I tell you shall I count the ways
Can I find the words that could explain
How my heart, my life, my soul you changed forever

You ease my pain with such a gentle hand
And when I´m with you I´m a better man
And I'll never ever understand the way

That you sing to me without music or words
The Sweetest melody that I've ever heard
When I look into your eyes
I hear a song that never dies
Cause you sing to me

Theres so much evil in the world today
Everybodies tryna to make a way

Looking for a peace of love to make it better
But we can make it through and rise above

With your little serenade of love
...
