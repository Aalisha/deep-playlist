I want to go where my country girl goes
Back where my green-grass roots are growing
I feel at ease with my country girl, yeah
She knows how to groove me

I'll take you back 'bout a year ago
She was born of earth, fire, and water
She stays alone in a house by a waterfall
Living herself to death

I want to go where my country girl goes
