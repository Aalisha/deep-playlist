Selfless defense of freedom and rights
Justice comes at such a heavy price
One step too far and then you cross the line
Are you willing to make that sacrifice?

Chorus:
Will you stand up for what is right-Only the wrong survive
Are you afraid to fight- Only the wrong survive
Many of you won't even try- Only the wrong survive
The righteous ones always have to die- Only the wrong survive
