Billie sol was a man
From the giant texas land
He put the chamber of commerce on a limb
They voted him the best
And the government did no less
Until the i.o.u.'s of texas fell on him
Stand tall, billie sol, we don't know you at all
We've taken down your pictures from the wall
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal
We have got to face elections in the fall

I remember when
Bill had influential friends
He celebrated christmas every day
He filled texas banks with his fertilizer tanks
