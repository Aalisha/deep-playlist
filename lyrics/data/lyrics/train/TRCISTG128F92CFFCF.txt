You've denied me baby,
The satisfaction of your love.
So I've been walking home alone,
Cause you left me out in the cold.
(He left you out, now I'll take you home)

I'll be here after midnight, wearing my beliquent frown.
But you know it won't be long before
I have to put your picture down.
(Just take it down, you gave her up)

I can't hear you baby,
When you tell me you don't want me now.
So I'll be hanging by the phone,
Though I know you'll never make the call.
(Don't make that call, he'll put you down)

Call me in the daylight, speaking of a future plan
But when you make demands
I know that I could never be your man
