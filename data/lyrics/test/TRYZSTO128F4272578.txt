We've been driving allnight long just to reach our destination in your town
We've been five hundred miles everyones asleep there's not a sound
Ooh eighteen weels a-rolling, eighteen weels a-rolling round and round


Please mister driver won't you pull over here we're really hungry
Well we'll have 14 steak and eggs, 14 orange juice and 14 cups of coffee
Let's get back on the bus, this is one place that I really wanna see


Well we're 18 Miles from Memphis
