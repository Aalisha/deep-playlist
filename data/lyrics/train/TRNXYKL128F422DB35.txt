I lost my heart in a moment of madness
Took a chance on romance with you
But you roll your dice as cold as ice
Llady luck's got nothing on you
It's too bad I'm all out of luck again

You deal your cards under the table
Never giving nothing away
You're the black queen of hearts tearing me apart
Cheating on me night and day
It's too bad I'm all out of luck again

Somebody throw me a life preserver
...
