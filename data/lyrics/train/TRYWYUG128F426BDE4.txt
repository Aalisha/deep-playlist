Open your eyes, you're still here
Still safe, at peace in this world
So great, you're free
You don't have to fight for your life
But just say, just say
There's fire from the sky
And you're burning alive

Why all this pain and
Posion in her mind
What can you change
When hatred made her blind soldiers
No reason to look into her eyes
...
