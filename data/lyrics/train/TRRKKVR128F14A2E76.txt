layin' round makin' butter from the cream
I know that we seen each other in a dream
my heart starts yearnin' when I'm all alone
so keep on churnin' till the cows come home

keep on churnin' and don't go slow
keep on churnin' everybody knows
you got to keep on churnin'
or it just don't mean a thing

fryin' pan's goin' crazy on the stove
a blue sky's growin' hazy in the cold
if I'd quit now it'd surely be a sin
I got to keep on churnin' till the end begins
