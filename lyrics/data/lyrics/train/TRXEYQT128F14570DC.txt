Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

She's 41 and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks 'round Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride
