I don't know where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there, 
All I know is, I'm just going 
I ran away from home last night, gone forever 
I was running for my life 
And I've heard the words of what I should be 
Live, Work, Die, I am the orphan of the night 

Take me down, I'm coming home, the road to ruins 
Inside the pleasure dome 
Take me down, I'm coming home, arena of pleasures 
Where I belong
