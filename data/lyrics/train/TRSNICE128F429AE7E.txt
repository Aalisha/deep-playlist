Hey I know...
That I can't talk to you right now
But I want you to see that I'll never let you down
And I can't stop these things from overcoming me
I have to learn to set you free...

I thought I'd be there for you
Now you're questioning if words I say were true

Stars are in my grasp
The ones you gave me that used to be wrapped all around you
...
