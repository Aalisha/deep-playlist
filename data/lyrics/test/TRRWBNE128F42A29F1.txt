I can prove anything
I'll make you admit again and again
That I can prove anything
The way that it's read again and again

And it's only 'cos you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
It's only 'cos you follow what the others do
It's no excuse to say you're easily lead

You could choose anything
You choose to lose again and again
And you could do anything
But why should you do anything again

And it's only 'cos you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You're winding yourself up until you're turning blue
Repeating everything that you read

So here we go with the letter
Well, can you fix it for me
Because we need entertainment
To keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your bed

You could try anything
And no one would know apart from you and me
And you could stop anything
...
