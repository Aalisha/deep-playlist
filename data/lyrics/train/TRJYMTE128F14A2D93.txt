the deeper you get the more you sink into it
faster you fall the more you crawl away from it
siamese at the knees she said and we're weighted
we're siamese if you please and she said that we're weighted
the more that you make the less you should take from others
the longer you live the more you should give to your brothers
siamese at the knees she said and we're weighted
we're siamese if you please and she said that we're weighted
