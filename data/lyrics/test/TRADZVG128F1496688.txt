Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run back to where you're from

Girl it's just ain't fair
What you want me to do
Got to run all the time girl
Just for you
You know that guy never was any good
He ain't never gonna treat you any good
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run Judy run run
Judy run run back to where you're from
