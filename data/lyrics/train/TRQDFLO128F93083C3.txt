My heart was a lonely house
Where strangers wandered in and out
Ooh, until Tuesday

Many loves have come and gone
With days running on and on
Like a marathon until Tuesday

[CHORUS]
Everything is Tuesday
Feeling light headed and woozy
Everything's been rosy since
The day sweet Tuesday chose me

I wanna thank her, thank her, thank her
