Thumbtack, I didn't see you there,
You caught me off my guard
And I can't say I was prepared
For the sharp prick, right into my heel,
This feeling isn't real
And so I don't know why I feel
So bad, it makes me mad

(Chorus)
I don't need for you to say
Anything more than it's ok
I wish these thoughts would go away
...
