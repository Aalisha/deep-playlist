[Madonna]

I, yi yi yi

I want you the right way
I want you, but i want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like i want you

Da da, da da, da da da

I'll give you all the love i want in return
But half a love is all i feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me no more
