Oooh, sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
My love has found another
And gone away

With him went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room

I know to you
It might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain

So badly, so badly
I want to go outside
(Such a lovely day)
But I can't stop these tears
From fallin' from my eyes
