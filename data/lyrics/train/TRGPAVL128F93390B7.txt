Save me, take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Save me, take me away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here

And I wonder if there will be anybody here alone
Another married guy tries to catch my eye
Should I smile or should I sigh?
Then you walked through the door and I saw that you were all on your own
Save me, take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
