Life can only get better
All you need to do is fall in love
Everyone else has fun but you
Buy that fun you'll fit in too

Dance your problems away
GOVERNMENT MUSIC
Cheap escape to that mind-control beat
GOVERNMENT MUSIC
Mellow outâ€”Life's too hard
You don't even want to think

See the macho cock-rock metal heroes
Vomit fire out of their big mouths
Shake your fists obediently
Make Leni Riefenstahl real proud

See the Aryan bozo with the red guitar
