When I'm in trouble or out of step
If my balance has been upset
Oh, there's a feeling I can't accept
There's one thing that helps me to forget
Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking
But it's plain to see,
I'm not the man I used to be

If life were easy and didn't ask,
didn't tease me or take things back
I could start to understand,
what makes me the man I am
