You got a smile so bright
you know you could have been a candle
i'm holding you so tight
you know you could have been a handle
the way you swept me off my feet
you know you could have been a broom
the way you smell so sweet
you know you could have been some perfume
Well, you could have been anything
that you, wanted to
and i can tell
the way you do the things you do
(the way you do the things you do) oh, baby
(the way you do the things you do)
As pretty as you are (uh uh)
