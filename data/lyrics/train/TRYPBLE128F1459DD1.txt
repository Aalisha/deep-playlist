Well, here we are again
Me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy
He's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells. "Where we gonna go?"
Oh, you'd think by now he'd know

Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are

Pile three in my truck
The rest follow us, and we'll head downtown
...
