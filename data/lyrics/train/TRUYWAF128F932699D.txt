Verse 1
Oh... Oh... Oh
You understand me like no one else does
You love me perfect, that's more than enough
I can't find a flaw in you, not even one
I know you'll be here, in the long run.
You know the reason I'm so insecure.
And day after day you convince me I; m wrong.
Telling me beauty is neither here or there.
But you understand why I'm fixing my hair

(Chorus) Cause I'm fixing my hair for you
I want to be beautiful
Even when you tell me I'm so pretty,
I need it to hide all my insecurities.
And I'm fixing my hair for you
