Well, my baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
Well, pick you up at ten, gotta have you home at two
Mama don't know what I got in store for you
But that's all right ‘cause we're looking as cool as can be

Well, we found a little place that really didn't look half bad
I had a whisky on the rocks, and changed half a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put a quarter right into that can, but all they played was disco, man
Come on, baby, baby, let's get out of here right away

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town
Make ‘em scream and shout
Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
We're gonna rock till we pop
We're gonna rock till we drop
We're gonna rock this town
