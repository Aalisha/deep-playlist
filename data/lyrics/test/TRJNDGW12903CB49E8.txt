It was the voice of a courageous explorer
A man dedicated to the pursuit of man's knowledge
And the expansion of his horizons

The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest

The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest

Check it, all I need's a second to wreck it
My thoughts are collected for the funk, expect it
I'm iller than a porno, I got skills like Zorro
Who's Perry Quomo? Tomorrow, tomorrow

Like orphan Annie, yo, it's the uncanny
Doobie, with bona fide funk for your fanny
Suckers, I pick 'em, so who be my victim?
Stick 'em an' boogers, I flick 'em

I'm guilty your honor, I rock like Nirvana
So fuck a piranha, just like Jeffery Dalhmer
I'll slice 'em, dice 'em, MCs, ice 'em
Yo, step to the sun an' I'll fuck you guys up

We're the the funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
We're the the funkiest, the funkiest
The funkiest, the funkiest
