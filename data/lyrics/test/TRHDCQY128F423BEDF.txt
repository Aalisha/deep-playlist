This house is echoing
With the sound of You knocking at the door
But with three locks and the shades down
You are easy to ignore

And I've put You on like an old pair of shoes
I've put You off but now I need You

And why, this love that never leaves me
Why are You holding me tonight?
Can't deny this love that is given me
Why, this love never leaves
...
