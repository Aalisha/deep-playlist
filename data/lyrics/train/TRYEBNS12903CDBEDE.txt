Everything I
You were, everything I
once had

The bar on 1st Avenue, we went there solely for you
So you can flirt with my best friend
Kiss a girl, tell me why you're laughing

mapped out in my bed for six long months

mapped out in my bed
for six long months
for six long months
Well I won't hold on,
