Waiting tables at your restaurant job
An old man reads the paper in the booth where I stop
To say hello when I'm in town
Ask a friend if you're around

And I'm thinkin' about those summer nights
We never slept we didn't mind
And I felt so alive and happy
Just sitting on the porch
And swingin' back and forth
Now everything seems so distant

But I promise I'm not too far
When you're alone in your brand new car
Driving your new black car
Into the rain

Are you listening to the radio?
Are you driving down a city road?
Are you alone in your new black car?
I imagine you there

And I'm sitting by the window here
The morning birds will reappear
...
