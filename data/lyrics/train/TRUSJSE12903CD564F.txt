We? ve heard it all before
We? ve learning to ignore
You must confess this awful mess
Is? nt just a bore
It? s more than we could bear
But you don? t really care
Kiss of live to save our life
All you do is stare
Sell yourself for cheap
Make our mother weep
Loosing pride is hard to hide
And harder still to keep
