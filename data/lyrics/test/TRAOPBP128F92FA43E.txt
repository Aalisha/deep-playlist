Don’t wake me up
Cause I’ll just get loaded again
Another try
And watch me blow it again
Take a ride, take a ride
With all my friends
And my mom says
I’m a cocksucker like my old man

And I know I win
And I know I win

I’ll pick you up a quarter to
Tell your dad
You’re sleeping at Sue’s
And fuck school
And fuck school
AND FUCK SCHOOL!

24- hours a day
We’re partyin’, partyin’
I’ll drink ‘til I black out
Then I’ll do it again

24-hours a day
...
