I hate the whole fucking world so the world better hate me
I bust in your house and kill your whole fucking family
I get so much pussy I think fucking is boring
Took 10 mothafuckas to the grave up north
They couldn't handle me enough so what you gonna do with me?
Lock me up? Punk I broke out of two penitentiaries
Join the gang ain't no thang I love competition
Shot my brotha in the head cause my hand was itching
Never liked my stepdad cause he was too phony
Stuck his arm up his ass cause he tried to swing on me
I killed 2 of my teachers cause they called me a dummy
Yo, ask me why I don't smile cause I don't think shit funny
I don't joke, bitch, nor do I clown
You can tell I was from Houston from the bodies I left around
Now you can take that shit to the bank
And tell all the fucking people that's why they call me Point Blank...

(What's your name, nigga? What's your name, nigga?) Point Blank...

When I go off people say they never saw shit
And close their ears cause I only kick the raw shit
You said you was hard so I started to busting the rough shit
Now you wanna cry, you must not be from South Park, bitch
