Ah, don't be an island son
Do not be an island son
Cause this is grand island son
You better get your beat on son

Lalala - shanghai I wanna go
You look so good when you're lonely

I'm gasoline you're fire
Together so much better than electro wire
No good to be alone
All hidden in the ripples of a river song

So turn your lights down low
