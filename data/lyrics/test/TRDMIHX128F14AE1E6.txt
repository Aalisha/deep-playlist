They're still building roads in themselves
And we can see them all if we start driving now
And we'll do all our thinking out loud
And wait for daylight

Was it a dream, we were out at a lake?
After ten years and separating states
To drain your blood of the poison
Wait for daylight

It's getting close now
Well, I felt the daylight
And it left me wanting more
Get me out of this empty town
'Cause I feel it changing me

There's a place off of safety in mind
