Down in New Orlean, where everything is fine
All them cats is drinkin' that wine
Drinking that mess to their delight
When they gets drunk, start singing all night

Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Pass that bottle to me

Drinking that mess to their delight
When they gets drunk, start fighting all night
Knocking down windows and tearin' out doors
Drinkin' half a gallons and callin' for more

Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Wine spo-dee-o-dee, drinkin' wine, bop ba
Pass that bottle to me

Hoy, hoy, hoy
Wine, wine, wine, Elderberry
Wine, wine, wine, or Sherry
Wine, wine, wine, Blackberry
Wine, wine, wine, half an' half
Wine, wine, wine, oh boy
...
