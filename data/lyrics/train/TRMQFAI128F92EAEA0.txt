Go-go, go-go girl, you drive me wild
Shake it, shake it, shake it, child
Eyes wide open but you see no one

I'ma be there
When the music comes
Oh, shake it, baby

Go-go, go ahead
And work your show
Till you can't work no more
Go-go girl, you know
You're looking good

I see you wink your eye
Winking at every guy
Go-go girl, don't you realize

That I'm waiting for you
Whenever you get through
Oh, ooh, baby
...
