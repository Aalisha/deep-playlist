1st verse:
If I was million miles away
Could you promise that our love would be safe
And if a beautiful girl was in face would you remember
Even remember my name
I need to know right where you stand
Cause I'd give up everything I have
And baby for your love, if thats what it takes to last

Chorus:
I swear for you boy I'd go to extremes
Cause our love is priceless
Our love is priceless
Take my car, take my home, take everything
Cause our love is priceless
Our love is priceless
