Stay with me forever and a day if I could be near you
For a lifetime I'd never want for anything
Hearing your voice is like icicles down my spine
And touching your warm skin
Starts electric storms
Through my mind.

You put a strength in me
I knew something was missing
Just take me everywhere you go
This girl's in heaven
