All Hell Let Loose

When the night closes in,
and the dark shadows fall,
That's where it starts again,
evil making it's call,
To someone who sits unaware,
could it be you I'd beware,
There's footsteps behind you,
Your at the scene of its lair.

Imagination burns,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose,
...
