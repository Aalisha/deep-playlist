I can't believe life's so complex
When I just wanna sit here and watch you undress
I can't believe life's so complex
When I just wanna sit here and watch you undress

This is love, this is love that I'm feelin'
This is love, this is love that I'm feelin'
This is love, love, love that I'm feelin'

Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head
Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head

This is love, this is love that I'm feelin'
This is love, this is love that I'm feelin'
This is love, love, love, love that I'm feelin'
