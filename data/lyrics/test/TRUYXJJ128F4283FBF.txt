Stop your wars mon!
Come on! Well, well, well.

Babylon a cause all the problems.
They mek the wars,
But you don't know how to solve dem.
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Systems mek all the problems.
They mek the wars,
But don't know how to solve dem, oh no, oy!
Well it's that easy,
To fly overhead an' drop your bombs,
Upon the innocents.
Well it's that easy,
To fly overhead an' drop your bombs,
Upon the sufferers.

Let me tell you:
War! Is not your solution!
War! Is not your solution!
