(Toby Gad, Jens Gad)

I have this picture(?) in the moonlight
Just look straight into my eyes
I could not stop myself from dreaming
As she appeared? the sky

I go up and down now, I can feel the heatwave
I can't stop? my freedom with my dreams

Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
Oh oh oh oh (And I don't know what to do)
Can't you feel my love (And I don't know how to say it)
