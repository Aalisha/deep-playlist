Brickface and Stucco met on the corner 
Of 48th st. and 3rd Boulevard 
Brickface in a white t-shirt 
Stucco wore a skin tight skirt 
They'd go to the Village on saturdays 
Go to Broadway and see cheap plays 
Brickface decided he was a she and 
Stucco decided to go out to sea 
In fishnet stocking and old saltines 
They parted happily, said they'd meet 
Again in 2003, 2003, 2003!
