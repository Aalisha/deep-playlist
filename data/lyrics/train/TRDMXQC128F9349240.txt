Baby, please dont go
Baby, please dont go
Baby, please dont go
Down to new orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please dont go

Baby, your mind done gone
Well, your mind done gone
Well, your mind done gone
Left the county farm
You had the shackles on
Baby, please dont go

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
To git you way down here
I make you walk alone
