Can You Believe It
There's No Denial
I Am The Reaper
Harvest Your Fire

Feed On Your Hate
See My Eyes Glowing Red
Watching You Burning Your Bridges
Death In My Wake
And I'm Onto Your Trail
Spilling The Blood Of The Richness

The Freedom You Shackled
Glory You Stole
All In The Name Of My Burning Soul

When The Day Has Come
We Break The Spell, Ohh
When The Day Has Come
We'll Fight You All,
When The Day Has Come
