I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin'
that I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
