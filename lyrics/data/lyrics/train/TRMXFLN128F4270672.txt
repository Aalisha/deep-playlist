Know a cat named way out Willie
He got a cool little chick called rockin' Millie
He can walk and do the Susie-Q
Do that crazy hand jive too

Hand jive
Hand jive
Doing that crazy hand jive

Papa told Willie you'll ruin my home
Say you and that hand jive just got to go
Willie told Papa don't put me down
Doing that hand jive all over town

Mama, mama look at Uncle Joe
In the corner getting down with sister Flo
