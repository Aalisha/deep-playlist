Honey butter, what do you mean who am I?
My father is one of the riches men in this country
He is a member of Who's Who
I wear Gucci, Poucci and Via Ruche, just for fun that is

I have played with Xenon and beyond
I have a town house and a chalet next to the Earl
You know, Earl the Pearl Monroe
Yes, well I had a Mercedes just like his
I think it's beige and brown or, or was it the other one
The one that we take into town

Yes, sir, pretty lady, I can't take much more of this
We've been talking for an hour, I'm so dizzy I can't think
It seems the only subject I know much about is you
Well, I hate to disappoint you but I got things to do

Don't laugh, it ain't funny that I spent most of my money
And my glasses is getting soggy in my hand
I thought a bad girl like you would have some better things to do
To make a person think you are a creep

(Don't be so cool)
It's not how you style your hair
 (Don't be so cool)
It's not the clothes you wear

 (Don't be so cool)
