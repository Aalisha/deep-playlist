I need your sweet inspiration
I need you here on my mind every hour of the day
Without your sweet inspiration
The lonely hours of the night just don't go my way

A woman in love needs sweet inspiration
And honey that's all I ask, you know, that's all I ask from you
I gotta have your sweet inspiration
