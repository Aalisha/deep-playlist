Somewhere in America one night
Out on the road I saw her face
Trying hard to blend in with the others
She looked so out of place

Woo oh, her eyes
They caught me by surprise
They haunt my memory
Woo oh, she turned me around
Read my thoughts aloud
She moved me with a look
Then vanished in the crowd

You know who you are
In the night you'll feel a shiver
As I touch you from afar
Shining like a star
From the world we'll keep a secret
You know who you are

The towns all run together
As the days pour into nights and fade away
Staring at the schedule
To go back to the city and the day
...
