Pulling on your lazy arms
Get up out of bed
There's vanity
In the holes from which we bled
Your armies have come and gone
Silence on the battleground
This insurgence was just enough to see them drowned

You wanna swim with us, you gotta get to the water
You wanna swim with us, you gotta get to the water
You wanna swim with us, you gotta get to the water
You wanna swim with us, you gotta get to the water
You wanna swim

Take me to your mountain
