(Kim Carnes/Dave Krampf/Duane Hitchings)

It's the song that just keeps playing on the radio
And you know I haven't seen you for a while
I lie awake at night
And wonder how you are
And I wish that I could see you again

Is it fate or is it luck
That brings us back
Or is it just a common point of view
Time has put a spell on you
You never seem to change
And I wish that I could see you again

I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after
All come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
...
