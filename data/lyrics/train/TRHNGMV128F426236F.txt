Gotta love for destruction
Gotta feel for danger tonight
Hey, Mr. Moonlight wontcha follow me down
I need the company
Everybody tells me you're no good
That's all right with me

Gimme one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
Come on baby, poison me

Gotta hunger for fatal attraction
I'm savin' all my passion for you
I gotta heartbreak habit that I can't kick
...
