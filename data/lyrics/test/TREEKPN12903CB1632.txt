Ten minutes to downtown
Is ten minutes too far
When my friends all say I'm crazy
Maybe I'm being selfish
Maybe I'm just scared

Don't be gone when I get home
I need you there

If I had to explain it
I wouldn't know where to start
It's like you're falling in love
While I just fall apart

Ten minutes to downtown
...
