(Kirsty MacColl/Pete Glenister)
It wouldn't take a long time
To explain what lies between us
And it wouldn't take a genius
To work out what the scene is
It might just take a pilot
To give you a natural high
But you're sending off those bottletops
For your 'free piece of mind!'
And are you just waving or drowning?
It's so hard to tell when you're so far away

Oh innocence has passed you by
A long long time ago
I was the fly upon your wall
And I saw what you know
Your pornographic priestess left you for another guy
You frighten little children and you always wonder why
Always wonder why
