Waiting for Jehovah Sunrise
Don't you forget to put on factor number twelve
Waiting for Jehovah Sunrise
If you'll be long gone I'll pick somebody else
Waiting for Jehovah Sunrise
I wanna travel in the speed of light
Aching for Jehovah Sunrise
It's gonna happen in the air tonight
You are the chosen one
