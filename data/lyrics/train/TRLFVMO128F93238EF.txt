The case for the catwalk
Clues are too cool for the kids
The importance of keeping your clothes on
And taking your mind off of this

Oh so many buildings
Museums and churches, historical houses
Eat in or take away anything that fits in your mouth
Open top buses are winding round things of general interest
I'm interested in something, the direction you take
If you want to get out out out out

Every night I am woken by police
Put this city in disrepute if it means I can sleep

The case for the catwalk
Clues are too cool for the kids
The importance of keeping your clothes on
And taking your mind off of this
...
