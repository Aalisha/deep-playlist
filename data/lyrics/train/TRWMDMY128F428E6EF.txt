I'm on the run, i've lost my gun
i can't seem to get away
the crew's standing by ready on a good ship in the bay
and wouldn't you laugh, there's not much time
there's more on my plate
my girl has just gone (ahh)
one more day, two more day
three more day to go
three more day, two more day
one more day to go
one more day 'till i get her inside my brain
i've thrown my baby out with the bathwater
what did i do?
throwing my baby out with the bathwater
throwing my baby out with the bathwater
I got to the ship in the nick of time
