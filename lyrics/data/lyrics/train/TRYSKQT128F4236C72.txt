On the banks of the deep end
Where your soul is your best friend
Searching for a reason
To go astray
Wild dreams turn to nightmares
Silver clouds turn to golden stairs
And everything that you used to know
Is slipping away

Here I've got my puzzle-piece
Only got it for a short term lease
No time for asking
No going back to get hurt
I take a little from the mixture
Try to fit it into the picture
Got a place where you're standing
Dig your shoes into the dirt

Trying hard to get back
Runnin' on the stones
Put you on my shoulders
We can be the only one
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look

There's a reason to be home
...
