Move!
Because you can't keep waiting,
The time has come for creating.
You've got a dream, so you better start working,
And I mean that you gotta stop jurkin'.

Take a chance right now that you can,
Try to build up a masterplan.
No insurance and no gurantee,
But there's more than wait and see.

Hey baby, take it baby,
Up to you if you wanna go crazy.
It's a waste of time to keep waiting,
Cause if you wake up, time is mating.

Get it on, get it goin' on,
But you gotta be tough, you gotta be strong.
Better learn before you start flying,
Keep on, keep on tryin'

Chorus
Keep on tryin'
