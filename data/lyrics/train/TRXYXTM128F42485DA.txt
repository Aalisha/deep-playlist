Reality is what you want to see
It shouldn't make a difference to me
I put my trust in what you had to say
It didn't make a difference anyway

i know u did your very best to sh*g me
Disappointment is what you've made this
Expectations overrated
Disappointment is what you've made this
My ambition is so deflated

Reality is different for me
My eyes are opened wide enough to see
