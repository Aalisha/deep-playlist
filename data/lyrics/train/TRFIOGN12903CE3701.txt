Don't make me tell you that you're the only one
Because you never said I was who you want
I fight to change you, you always stay the same
I wonder how much longer are we gonna wait

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know

You are the only one who
Can bring me down
Chasing something
I can never want now

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

Don't act like you care
It's not what I want
Save face and keep tight

If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know, know
'Cause I'm gonna take it
As far as you are willing to go, go

And why can't we just meet in the middle, oh, oh
If we're gonna make it
Please, you gotta let me know
...
