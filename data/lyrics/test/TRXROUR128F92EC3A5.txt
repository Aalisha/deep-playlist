Oh Cherry oh, Cherry oh, baby,
Don't you know I'm in need of thee?
If you don't believe it's true,
What have you left me to do?
Look how long I, ve been waiting,
For you to come right in.
And now that we are together,
Please make my joys come over

(Chorus)
Whoa -oh-oh-oh oh oh oh oy
Whoa -oh-oh-oh oh oh oh oy
