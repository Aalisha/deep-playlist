The admiral was still fighting
Though he had pistol shots in his side
And the other ones gave away
Their well-deserved stripes

A misled queen wanted to go home
But she came dependent from the people she know
And she felt like a dog
Begging to be taken outside

And can't you hear the low moaning sound in my stomach
Begging for serenity now
Serenity now

Well I spent my saturday nights
Bombing over crowded nightclubs
They're the packaging of the soul, the stadiums of the damned
...
