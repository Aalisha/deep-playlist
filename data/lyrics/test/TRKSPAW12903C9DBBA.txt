No ounce of God
As the alter bleeds
No form of priest at this gathering
No ounce of God as the alter bleeds

So nice to meet detective Ace McCree
I appreciate your tactful timing
Can't say the same for your little girl
But here's something you might not know

She's pink inside just like my other toys
And the blue has been ripped from her ocean eyes
But Jamie, she no longer breathes

This is famine the flood
The locust that eclipse the sun
And as the sulfur and smoke surrounds me
(Three plagues from heaven unleashed)
And as the trumpet sings the ocean bleeds
The army of God sets upon me
I wear the mark of the beast

Jamie, speak
And Jamie, oh God please
Just take me, please just take me
