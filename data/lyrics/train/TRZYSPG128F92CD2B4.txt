Don't save me
Im not the one you should be looking out for
Don't save me
I know it's a lot to ask but
Don't save me
This can make things way to complicated
Don't save me
I know, I can make it on my own

Sometimes I like to think about you
And the words that come out your mouth
And when things get rough I wouldn't want to take another step forward
Look, can you tell me are you eager, are you ready to call it love
Can u feel it, do u mean it, can we burn this down, can we burn this down

If I could ask a simple question about the way that you call my name
It's so appealing, it's deceiving
So come back another day
Can we play this, delay this, or maybe find another way
Do u need me, believe me if we burn this down
