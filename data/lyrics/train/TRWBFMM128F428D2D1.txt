I'll never know what brought me here
As if somebody led my hand
It seems I hardly had to steer
My course was planned.
And destiny it guides us all
And by it's hand we rise and fall
But only for a moment
Time enough to catch our breath again.

And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
How one live touches the other
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together
We travel through as far as we can
And we have waited for this moment in time
