He works way too much for way too little
He drinks way too early till way too late
He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone
Except when he comes in here
And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy
