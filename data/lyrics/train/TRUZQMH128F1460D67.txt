Teenage had a race for the nighttime
Spent my cash on every high I could find
Wasted time in every school in LA
Gettin' loose, I didn't care what the kids say

We're white punks on dope
Mom and dad moved to Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
Can't clean up though I know I should
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
White punks on dope, white punks on dope

Other dudes are livin' in the ghetto
Born in Pacific Heights, don't seem much betto
...
