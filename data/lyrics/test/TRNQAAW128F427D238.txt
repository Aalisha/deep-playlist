In the past the empty bottles, see through your sympathy.
I'd rather be taking sorry's from the manor of the adam's street.
You spit out your words with a terrible stutter,
With feelings that a stories like a cheating disease.
If I can't trust you, how can I trust the conner chasing me?

So don't sell me out.
'cause I'm worth more than the finger that is bearing your class ring.

Chase the drinks you can't control, 
Hide your hands behind your head.
Holding my hand, make sure no one sees the stings attached to them.
You run with the pack, with the running obsessions,
Hold your breathe when you've lost your way.
Lie to me again and you've lost her,
...
