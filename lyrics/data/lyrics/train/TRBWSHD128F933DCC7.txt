I remember those days [Incomprehensible] money
Never checked the price, it just all came to me
But now in days I'll be pinchin' every penny
5 star dining at my local Denny's

I've been sitting on the curb in your neighborhood
Looking at that streetlight thinking how I could
Just get one response, maybe a glance
But the system has it's rules about the second chance

Living by the tracks in the Barrio
Keeps my welfare state from the Don Risto
Don't be amazed when you see me out of line
My baseball bat will take care of Joe Grind
Thought I was one, baby, I'm a fool
