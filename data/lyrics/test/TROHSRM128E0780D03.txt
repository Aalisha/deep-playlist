You know, I saw it coming, I watched her watch me
The girl wanted what I had isn't that the story?
I'm not mad, I'm not mad

She spent so much time pursuin' you
Knowing that you were blind
And that's a bummer babe it left me under babe

And it's true her tits were blinding you
While I had a hard enough time finding you
And that's a bummer babe but I still love you baby

(Get even)
Don't you hate when you lose your man to a chick
(Even)
And she does it in your face to make sure you feel lit

(Get even)
So the story draws out like some long ass skit
(Even)
And bitch you knew that I like him get even

She wants to change her mind
And make sure you don't ever end up mine
And that's a bummer babe she's so annoying babe
(God)

But over my dead body will you not see that
The grass is sure enough more green
And that's a bummer babe don't you ever wonder baby?

This is no new phenomenon
