Never said I knew
all the right things to do
but I know when
somethings wrong
why would you choose, somethin' 
knowing that you'd lose, once again
it's lost and gone
never gonna change
'cause you made up your mind
ain't no body stoppin you
crossing that line

You're steppin over
to the other side
we left a trail
it only appeals
to how it makes you feel inside
I know although it seems
the grass is growin and its always green
you're steppin over

Wish I knew the way
...
