My Aunt Minnie bought a mini-skirt,
A mini-skirt,
A mini-skirt.
She's too skinny for a mini-skirt.
Such a skinny creature
Shouldn't feature such a feature 
But my old Aunt Minnie bought a mini-skirt
And all the fellas flirt.
Everybody's wise
To my Aunt Minnie's thighs
In her crazy mini-skirt. 
She's thinking young,
She's thinking young.
She's thinking younger than the youngters she's among.
She's really cool, she's hip,
A gas, a trip.
She's the inspiration
