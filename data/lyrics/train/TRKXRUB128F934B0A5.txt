Eye of newt for gods of love and hate and war before us
We pray and dance and scheme
And conjure pagan ritual lust
We cast our spell into the sky
We sacrifice a life to live, some one must die
He's calling, he's calling, he's calling
There will be blood tonight
A sacrificial lamb in white
There will be blood tonight
The ceremony flames ignite
There will be blood tonight
...
