Baby, I got plans tonight you don't know nothing about
I've been sitting 'round way too long trying to figure you out
But you say that you'll call and you don't and I'm spinning my wheels
So I'm going out tonight in my red high heels

I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend who says still has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town, flaunt him around for everyone to see
Well, you said watch yourself, baby, yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me in my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
