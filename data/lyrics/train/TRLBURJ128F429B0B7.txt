We'd better respect
This land and reflect
On how we plant the seed
And grown inherent defect
The conductor has been hailed
Even though decisions failed
Another life, another train has been derailed
Take cover, game over
Sitting in the outer rings
And running for our lives
Start running, they're coming
Now put 'em in a body bag and ship 'em to their wives
With nothing in our wake we make the same mistake
With no resources left to save
Sickened from our water still we can't accept the blame
