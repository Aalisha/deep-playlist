Move slow
Now your time's at hand
Take heed
'Cause our love has passed

Hot fuse
Can be short or long
The time bomb
Of your life has come

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Dry land is just a love away
Warm sun and a place to lay
I see your future
...
