Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, yeah, with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song
And I heard he had a style
And so I went to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was, this stranger
There before my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
