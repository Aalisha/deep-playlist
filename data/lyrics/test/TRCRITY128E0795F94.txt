Maybe it's the first time
That you'll hear the voice
We, he, she, it is love, is light
Gives life, gives sound

We, he, she, it demands your attention
'cause we, he, she, it is, was and will be
And you are not alone... trust
Like we, he, she, it trusts you
Now before and forever
Now before and forever
No matter who and where you are
No matter who and where you are
