I need a refueling, I need your kiss
Come on now and plant it on my lips
I need a refueling, I need your kiss
Come on now and plant it on my lips

Whammy kiss me, whammy hug
Revitalize me, give me whammy love
Yeah, whammy kiss me, whammy hug
Revitalize me, give me whammy love

On Planet X, ohh, it won't be long now
I got a light year to get to the phone now
I'm gonna contact you when I get home

Give it all you got, give it all to me
Come on mammy and throw me that whammy
I said, "Give it all you got, give it all to me"
Come on mammy, throw me that whammy

And now I know I need that whammy kiss
Whatever you do, I'm just passing the time
