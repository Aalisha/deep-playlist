If you just take my sense of freedom
If you just take away my home
You can't ever hope to win me
This I'll tell you for sure
There is strength in the common people
For the people is all we really are
Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
...
