Good mornin' little schoolgirl
Can I go home with you
Tell your mama and your daddy
That I'm a little school boy too

Baby I love ya', I just can't help myself
Your so good lookin' pretty baby
I don't need nobody else
Good mornin' little school girl

Can I go home with you
ooo, ooo, ooowee

I'm gonna leave you baby
