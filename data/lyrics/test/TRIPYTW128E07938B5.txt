I'm gonna take my baby on a little joy ride
Well, she'll be ghost-white pale sittin' by my side
Yeah, I'll shakin' like a leaf and it ain't no wonder
Drive like lightning, crash like thunder

I'm gonna race with the devil, speedin' down the track
And if he beats me to the line, I ain't comin' back
Yeah, you ain't worth nothin' when you're six feet under
Drive like lightning, crash like thunder

Drive like lightning crash like thunder
Ain't worth nothin' when you're six feet under
All wrapped up in hot chrome and steel
...
