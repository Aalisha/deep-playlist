So let me tell you 'bout
Last Saturday night
The club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out
Wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake it pretty
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You make me rock
You make me rock
You turn me on
