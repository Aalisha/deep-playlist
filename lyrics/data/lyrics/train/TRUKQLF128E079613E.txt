Do you wanna get a little something
Baby now what's on your mind
I wanna know now yeah
Everybody in the house is jumping
And I can't spend all my time, with you
Nobody can do the things you do
And I'm so glad that you wanna be mine
But I think you gotta be
A little easy loving me
I'll never stop
Give what I got
All in the way that I love you
Doesn't have to be all or nothing baby
Don't you know I'm never gonna waste your time
Can't you see the way that I feel
Got to believe
I wanna be
Your number one
If you want it face to face
I'm gonna tell you baby
