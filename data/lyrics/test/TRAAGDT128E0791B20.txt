Fortune smiled upon me in my hour of need
I was naked and you came with clothes for me
After years of broken homes, broken hearts and broken dreams
Someone's smiled upon me in my hour of need

Will you give me shelter in my hour of need
Be my guide and helper, never failing me
With your arms so open wide, shield me from the storms outside
