A victim to another level
That no one ever cared about
The way I ease my sufferin'
Is killin' me again

I would not prescribe
This feelin' for you
A pain with slow sustain
Like a sad song lives on

When the world won't take you back
You know everyone's the same
We're all a part in God's song

When the world won't take you back
You know everyone's the same
We're all a part in God's song
