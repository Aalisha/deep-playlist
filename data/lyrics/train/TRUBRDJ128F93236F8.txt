You've been starrin' in your own life (eeeh eh)
But that was just a preview (eeeeh)
You're bringing on the sunshine now
You're shining like a diamond now

Yo, this is what you wanted
Some would even die for
Let 'em know it's heart-felt
This is what you cry for
Before you couldn't dream of it
Now you're feeling closer
Me; I'm just a ghetto kid
Now I'm on the poster
Can't explain the feelin'
Heartbeat's racin'
I'm dealin' with emotions
Excitement's amazin'
Tell them; we've been ever so patient
And now it's in sight so we're reachin'

(And nooow)
You're lookin' down from the bird's eye
(You shiiine)
You shine on like a floodlight
Show them this ain't nothing like a mistake
It's a risk that we all take

(And nooow)
You're lookin' down from the bird's eye
(You shiiine)
You shine on like a floodlight
Show them right now's perfect timin'
Clocks just don't slow down

You've been starrin' in your own life (eeeh eh)
But that was just a preview (eeeeh)
The main doors are open now
The whole crowd's watching now
