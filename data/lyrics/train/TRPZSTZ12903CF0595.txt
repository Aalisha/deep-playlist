Kno, you laced it!
Oh!

Hook:
I'll shine ("PackFM" scratched*) x8
Forever!

Verse 1:
I'm back and it's on, the man you always askin' em for
Now you relieved, like you was scratchin' your back wit a fork
We argue who's gonna son you, like your parents divorce
I'm off the radar, you the cartoon in the back of the Source
"It's no fair, Pack's a vet, I never battle before"
That's no excuse, shut up, bitch - you just mad 'cuz you lost
Don't ever sit in a room with your back to the door
You could get shot through the peephole, I seen it happen before
Ain't nuthin' new to me, I school MCs
But they viewin me
They in the back of the class and their glasses is off
You the reason the underground is in the back of the store
My name on a CD means it's dope before the plastic is off
I could've freestyled this verse, but I'm sick wit the written
You ain't spittin', you grab the microphone, you hack and you cough
MC's thinkin' that they GI's wit fatigues instead of Levi's
Who you kiddin? Do you really think you lastin' a war?
I spit rhymes in the booth until my larynx hoarse
Grab the mic on stage till all my callouses sore
Hands cramped till I can't peel the bandages off
