Dead friends lying back to back
In this manufactured heart attack
They have done their politicians' will
Ten thousand years on, they'll be lying still

Help me find a way out
Hear all our restless spirits shout
Turning around I see a new age dawn
And I look on

Tracer bullets lightning up the sky
A soldiers' duty is to die
Night times descended on this mushroom cloud
...
