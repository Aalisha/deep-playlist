I can't explain it, something's deep inside,
I can't contain it, why should I try to hide?
What I feel about You, oh it's just too much,
I know that these words are not enough,
So I'm gonna live mine as expressions of my love,
There's somethin' 'bout Your love.

Can I take a moment, I'm gonna try to say
What's on my heart and on my mind,
I even tried to write a song,
But the words are too contrived,
I just had to let it lie;
Singing oh my Adonai, to the Most High.

(Then like a river, emotion sings Your song),
(I shiver, these are the words I can't deliver);
(I come undone because I just can't find a way),
You're unexplainable.

I get up in the morning
And the sun's already testified to a brand new day;
So I guess I better get this smile and be on my way,
And did I forget to say, "oh what a lovely day".

(And in the dawning, somehow the newness is reborn),
(and somehow the news comes like a storm),
(and I come undone because I just can't find a way),
...
