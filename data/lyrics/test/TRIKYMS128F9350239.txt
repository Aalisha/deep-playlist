Think about what you've got and compare it to what i've got
Now what do you think my girl wants, my girl wants
Think about what i've got and compare it to what you've got
What do you think my girl wants, my girl wants
What do you think my girl wants?

Don't call her lazy cause she's crazy 'bout the daytime tv
Channel 3 look at me, i'm a real wheel watcher
They think i'm smart, they think it's art but then i start with a crash
I'm just a brash trash talker
