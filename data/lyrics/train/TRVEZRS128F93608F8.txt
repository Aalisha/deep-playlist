Tell everybody I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
With blue skies ahead yes

I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be

Tell everybody I'm on my way

And I'm loving every step I take

With the sun beating down yes
I'm on my way

And I can't keep this smile off my face
'Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
