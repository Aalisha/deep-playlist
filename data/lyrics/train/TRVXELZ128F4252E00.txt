Tip-toeing where you shine your light
Stealing my heart into the night
And springing it on me just when the time was right
You told me about her and all the plans you're making
Lost in the woods with two crumbs for taking

Now I don't want to share
Your fingers through my hair
But if you keep calling my name
I'll bury my head in the sand hoping you'll stay
...
