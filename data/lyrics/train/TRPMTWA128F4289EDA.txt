Gather 'round cats and I'll tell you a story
'bout how to become an all-American Boy.
Just buy you a guitar and put it in tune
and you'll be a rockin and a rollin soon.
Impressin the girls, hittin hot licks, and all that jazz.
I bought me a guitar about a year ago and I
Learned how to play it in a day or so.
And all around town it was well understood
that I was knocking 'em out like Johnny B. Goode.
Hot licks, showing off, ah, number one.
Well I practiced all day and up into the night,
My papa's hair was a gettin kinda white.
He didn't dig that, ah, rock and roll.
He said, "You can stay boy, but that's gotta go."
