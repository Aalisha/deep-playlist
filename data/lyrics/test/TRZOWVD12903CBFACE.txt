I've been waiting on some progress
I've been waiting on some progress but you give me no choice
Gonna have to walk you through this
Standing still on moving shadows, it won't get you too far
It won't get you too far

Can I take you home?
'Cause you are the only one I trust
This place crawls with snakes and we are dancing in the dark
