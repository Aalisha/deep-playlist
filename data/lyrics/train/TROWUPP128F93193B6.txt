Mistress of the starry night
Is rising, fall prey to her might
The temptress rising
Moon dancing in her veils
Shaking the soul way deep inside
The curse prevails the haunted mind
Crying on the hills of sadness

The love once beautiful
Now forever falling down
The wolf's growling in my soul
It's fighting to get out
