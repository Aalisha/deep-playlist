City of screaming statues
Your soul will grow to understand and respect this place
It will be with your in your heart, on your journey

The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions, slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts

Scream

The struggle of the soul
Depends on the strength of your will
Among the twisted shapes of your madness
You will find your light and your genius
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real
