And we kiss alone
In a parked car
At least I think so
There's a flashlight waving
Out somewhere
You can see it down the road
And the saddest part
Is that we mean so well
Don't want to hurt nothing
Don't want to hurt this fragile love we know
Because there is nothing left to hold
And we prayed that night
And you said to me
"don't you worry baby, the worst has come and the worst will go
and there's nothing we don't know"
I'll believe you then
