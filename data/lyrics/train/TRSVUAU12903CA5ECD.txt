You couldn't wake up
On a morning and try
To feel so good
That you didn't realise
And the things they're like
that stop me from crying
but at night
They stop me from crying

I couldn't take up
More space in my mind
There's a back door that isn't even to find
Because of a call from self-indulgence
We don't need our role
To prove that we're selfish
