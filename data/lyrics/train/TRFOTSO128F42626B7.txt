He looks like deniro
She's his brigitte bardot
And that's enough to hang around
With those who think they know
But if you've got the image
And symbols of success
You must be doing something right
To keep up with the jones's
They made it from the castin' couch
The sex was rock an' roll
They're everybody's business
Inquiring minds must know
Every slummy little detail
Every superficial move
And you can buy it retail
In pink and black and blue
She said
Take me walking where the surf is slow
He said
What's wrong with right here
I got places to go
Life at the top
Down on your knees
Don't stop
Don't stop
Give it to me
Life at the top
Where nothing is free
It's alright
Alright baby won't you live it with me
If you get up on the table
You're gonna lose your place
In the city of angels
Where fame's a state of grace
