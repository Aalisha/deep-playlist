Underneath your dream lit eyes
Shades of sleep have driven you away
The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here
Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives
Another day, another night
Has taken you again my dear
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there when you need, someone to depend upon

When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
When tomorrow comes
(Wait till tomorrow comes, yeah yeah)
