April skies are in your eyes
But, darling, don't be blue

Don't cry
Oh, honey, please

Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way

The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain so, honey, please, don't be that way

As long as we
See it through
You'll have me
I'll have you

Sweetheart
Tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way

Don't cry
Oh, honey, please

Clouds in the sky
