My love, my love, my love, how could you do this to me
My love, my love, my love, you were supposed to be
And I shouldn't have to tell you to explain yourself
My love, my love, my love, how could you do this to me
My love, my love, my love, you're not enough for me
And I shouldn't have to tell you to explain yourself

But all I have is your letter read
And I cannot get it out of my head
And I'm afraid, and I can't breathe,
And I'm in love with you
But you are not with me
And I have put so much into a life
I made too much about you now to lie
