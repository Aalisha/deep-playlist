(Dickie Peterson)
Listen here baby
Cause you outta time
I'm so sorry
It's the end of the line
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
All I know, Can not leave with you.


I'm so sorry I'm bringing you down
Well I'll make it up next time I'm around
Next time baby, I'll make it up to you
Yeah, Yeah!
