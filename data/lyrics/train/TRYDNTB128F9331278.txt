You put pressure on me
Anyway you wanted me
I was there for you
Undeniably
Time over and time again
You shut me out
I thought I was your man
I kept it real with you
But you was fake with me

As I close my eyes
I start thinking things
Is this love real love
And all that it brings
When I close my eyes
Only you I see
With another man
This is killing me

[Chorus:]
I am your man
But Only When Ur Lonely
If I was to bounce
That's when you'd want me
I am your man
But Only When Ur Lonely
You say its not the same
But I love you only
