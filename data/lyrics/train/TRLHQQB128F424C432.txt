It must be sunday morning
or else why do you lay your love on me so strong
it must be sunday morning, baby
else why do you lay your love on me so strong
it's been a long time, baby
since this old body's been turned on
Whatever you're doing, baby
take your time and do it right
whatever... whatever you're doing, woman
take your time and do it right
and when it gets to feelin' real good to ya, baby
...
