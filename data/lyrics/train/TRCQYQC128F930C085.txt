Two smiling faces, that's how it used to be
What once was forever, now a faded memory
The perfect illusion, for a while I guess it was
Without explanation the bloom fell off the rose
heaven help my heart, 'cause it's a lot like me
Wondering when this all will end and I find the love I need
I know it's out there somewhere,
somehow I still believe
I'm asking please
Heaven help my heart

This world can get crazy, these are troubled times
I'd walk through fire if love is what I'd find
...
