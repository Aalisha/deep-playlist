Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale
Forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this bulwark
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Indoctrinated minds so very often
Contain sick thoughts
And commit most of the evil they preach against

Don't try to convince me with messages from God
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves
It's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror

Behind the scenes opens reality
