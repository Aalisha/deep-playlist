Dil kho churaya
Dil kho churaya
Dil kho churaya

Tere dil da haal mein, haal mein sunawa
Ni kuriyeh ni gal maan le

Did I confuse you girl
Did I give you a sign
Coz this is not what we plan to do
I thought we'd talk it out
You told me that you didn't mind
At the time you understood
It was only for the night

Baby you know
Gotta let go
Come on act right
It was only one night
Baby you know
Gotta let go
...
