Chorus:
All my ex's live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd really love to be
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.

Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's
...
