I make you see the things you don`t wanna see
I make you feel the things you don`t wanna feel

You`re in my blood, I`m in your blood
I hate you for it you fucking slug
You`ve created me, I`ll be haunting you eternally
You fucking slug 

Salt in your wounds

Anger, hatred, violence, all the time
Bleeding, dying, screaming help me
Give it back, pass it on, on and on, on and on
This sickness must die with me

The demon you once feared now becomes reality

You`re in my blood, I`m in your blood
I hate you for it you fucking slug
You`ve created me, I`ll be haunting you eternally
You fucking slug
