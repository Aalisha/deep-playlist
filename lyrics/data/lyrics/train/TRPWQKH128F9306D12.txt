"Certainly"

Who gave u permission to rearrange me
certainly not me
who told you that it was alright to love me
certainly, certainly not me

I was not looking for no love affair
and now you wanna fix me
Was not looking for no love affair
and now you want to mold me
I was not looking for no love affair
now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
and now you wanna control me
hold me

I know you're really trying to get creative with me love
and that's alright, but
you tried to get a little tricky turned my back
and then you slipped me a mickey.

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
