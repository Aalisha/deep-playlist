We are, gathered here today. To say goodbye to the dearly de-parted
Yo he was bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
He was bound to dig his grave
You pushed up daisy's more than once in your life
You might as well meow because you played your nine lives
And don't shoot your yaps cause I might pull the trigger
I seen it happen to a brother who was rappin'
Frontin' real fat, and kept a crowd clappin'
But now he's loose, lost all his juice
Once a big star now his necks in a noose
The fame and the glory
He popped a lot of shit, but that's another story
I mean he blew up, there wasn't nothin' he couldn't do
The only problem now is that his head blew up too
Once platinum and now he can't sell a tune
I wonder how it feels to have your life go "Kaboom"
Reminiscin' how it was back in the days
When his records got airplay
You should of stayed street till you paid your cost
My record company can kiss
And my boys... can get my dilznick
Now that's the attitude you love and you live by
You used to eat steaks now you're beggin' for a french fry
You didn't know but I already figured
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to dig his grave
