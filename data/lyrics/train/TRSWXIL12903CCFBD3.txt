Love is a lonely place without you

I know I'm not alone
I should not be afraid
Cause I hear your voice
And I know you're there beside me

And so I give my heart
I live to love again
But I can't let go
Of the way I feel about you

Love is a lonely place without you
I miss you
And you're almost here
And I'm almost touching you
