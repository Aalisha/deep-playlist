I met a guy last night and
Girl, I felt the earth move
If you'd a-been there I swear
You would've felt it too
But I spilled red wine on his white shirt
I studdered and stumbled over all my words

'Cuz he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my God that smile of his just slays me
I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me
...
