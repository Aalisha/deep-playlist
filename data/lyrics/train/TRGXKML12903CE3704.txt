You're not, you're not, I don't think you're coming clean
I won't, I won't, I won't let you lie to me
Never felt so alone, it's funny how things go
Guess we'll never know

I took you back tonight
Hoping that you weren't the same
This won't ever feel right
Can't believe a word that you say

I took you back tonight
Hoping that you weren't the same
I'll give it up tonight

Don't tell me that you ruined this
'Cause you're scared
Now I know that you're full of it, woah, woah
For every minute you wasted
I will tear all apart what is left of this, woah, woah
'Cause baby, you ruined this

So stop and think, will you ever be happy?
