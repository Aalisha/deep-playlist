So here we go again
Another time but it feels the same
Got sick of waiting here

Set sail on the concrete waves
No survivors left to save
Too late for the walking dead

We'll make it on our own
Breathing our own air
'Cause no one else will care
And no one really knows

Need more room to shout
Time is running out
But even through your doubts
We will still be here
We will still be here

Seeing all I see and I still kill
Still kill the old way
...
