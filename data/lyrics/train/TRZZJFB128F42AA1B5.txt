Some days your back's against the wall
Some days you trip and drop the ball
There are days you lie to save face
And other days your soul is out of place

And no matter how many cigarettes you smoke
No matter how many books you read
No matter how many rosaries you pray
Your heart won't belive

Because you're still here
You're still here
Caught up in the middle of it

And you're still here
You still cry
Xalking through the middle of it

Still here
...
