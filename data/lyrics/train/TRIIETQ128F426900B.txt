The very next fight I have over you
Will end up the same, it's always the same
The very next fight from out of the blue
Will end up the same it's always the same

Some idiot staring at your legs, I know
You quietly tell me I should let it go
But how can I let it go when I can't control myself?
How can I let it go when I cannot help myself?

When I can't control myself, when I cannot help myself
When I can't control myself, when I cannot help myself

It's always the same, it's always the same,
it's always the same, it's always the same

When I can't control, control myself
Can't help, can't help, can't help myself
When I can't control, control myself
Can't help, can't help, can't help myself

The very next fight, I have over you
Will end up the same, it's always the same
The very next fight from out of the blue
