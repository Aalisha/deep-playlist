Norsemen hearts belong to you
Ancient God of war
You have created a sacred world
In ASGARD is your throne
Time has come to praise the God
Crazy beings were living here
In superstitious fear
Angry Gods would ever cause
Pestilence or war
Time has come to praise it has come
Do it over and over again
Praise him for the upcoming war
You won't feel astray
He's got power in his hand
So cry aloud his name
