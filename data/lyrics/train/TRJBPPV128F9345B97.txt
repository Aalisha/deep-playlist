Times are harder now
then they've ever been before
(Don't be discouraged)
So much hurt and pain
that it seems so hard to bare
(You gotta remember)

Faith is the only thing
that you can count on
Stand on His promises
that you may be strong

I'm here to let you know
there's always hope for you and me
In spite of what it feels like

Chorus
