I feel your comfort in my dreams
Unprotected silent screams
A light beyond your shadow beams
Still I don't know what it means

When seasons change

Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on cause I can't let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

And when the darkness turns a day
