Bridges are burning but faces are looking away
People are yearning for someone to show them the way
Tables keep turning and time is the price that we'll pay
Fast cars and freedom as long as you learn to obey

Fear is the virus they use to divide us
Hoping we'll all just pretend
That there's no other way
No other way
No other way
No, there's no other way

Ordered by a god above
To murder in the name of love
And they'll always claim that truth is on their side

Holding keys to a paradise
All their noise is a lullaby
For years they have ruled over you and I

All hits and I'm feeling fine
Uncontrolled and undivided
No vendetta
All's clear in a silent mind
Ain't no words that can describe it
So much better

Lay down your guns people and start again
...
