My sugar walls
My sugar walls

Where I came from
There's a place called Heaven
That's the place where
All the good children go

The houses are of silver
The streets are gold
But there's more
Where you come from
My sugar walls

My sugar walls, ooh
My sugar walls

Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion
When passion is hot
Temperatures rise
Inside my sugar walls
...
