Righteous I wasn' t always 
How many sins I don't know 
I betrayed lied and I cheated 
But still you would guide me 
through
In times I turned my back on you 
You would still be there and that's 
why I wanna Thank You 

Thank You (Thank You)
For everything (Thank You)
For all the blessings (Thank You)
And for all the lessons 

Thank You (Thank You)
