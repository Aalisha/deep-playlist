There? s something cold and blank behind her smile
She? s standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile
'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away today
Today to run away

A pill to make you numb
A pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
All the drugs in this world
Won? t save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut
And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a polaroid
...
