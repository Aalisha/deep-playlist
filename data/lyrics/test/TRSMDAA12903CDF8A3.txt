Come to save our souls you say
Or are we just prey?
Should we serve?
A lie absurd called the holy word
Jesus Christ you're out of luck
Let's thrash that fuck!

Can't they see what its come to be?
Preachers drowning in a sea of pity
But when we rise from the cloud of lies
We'll crush the church and take back our lives
