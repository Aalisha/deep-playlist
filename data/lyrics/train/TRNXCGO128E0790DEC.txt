In the beginning was the word
and the word was with God.
And God said: "Let there be life".

Life, oh life! Life is a miracle.

It's a miracle every time a mother gives birth
tell me who can say how much a child is worth.
A miracle living on this planet earth
rotating to the rhythm of the universe.
Life!
More precious than the rarest stone
more valuable than silver or gold.
Life!
The essence is invisible
to the scientific mind it's impossible.
Like the secret of the seed that grows into a tree
the starry galaxies remain a mystery.
