Don’t you ever call my name
Rotten lies and brain insane
False intentions twisted mind
Just beware, I'm not so blind
Your inner core, you can't deny
You’re your own reason to stand in your way
WAY
Action speaks louder, there's no more to say
HELL, HELL, HELL
Straight into hell in deepest night
DEEPEST NIGHT, DEEPEST NIGHT
Just beware, I'm not so blind
HELL, HELL, HELL
Honour you sold without a sight
DEEPEST NIGHT, DEEPEST NIGHT
it's so plain to see
