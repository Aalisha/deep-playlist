When I need good lovin' I always come home to you
You free my lifetime of the blues

Yes, I got that old time feelin' burnin' deep inside my soul
And I am yours, baby I'm home

And it's a good feelin' to know
It's such a good feelin' to know
Oh, it's a good feelin' to know
Somebody loves you

Colorado mountains, I can see your distant sky
You're bringin' a tear of joy to my eye

Yes, it's a good feelin'
It's such a good feelin' to know
