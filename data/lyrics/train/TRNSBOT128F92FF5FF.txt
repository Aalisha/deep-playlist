Stanley Michael
Volume 2: 1977 to 1980
One Good Reason
from "Stagepass"(Live at the Agora), 1976, EMI Records Group
I can't conceive of trying
Trying it all again
For one time I'm not buying
All the lies that never end
I think we've gone about as far
as we're ever gonna go
And seeing you for what you are
was enough to let me know


(CHORUS:)
Ain't nothing you can say now
gonna make me change my mind
