Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away
I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay
I feel so lost within pressured, I'm headed for that day
Just one thought in my head, really do I need this fame?

Every time, goddamn, I look at my seed, I see something I can't be
Beautiful and carefree, that's how I used to be
Like some goddamn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe

I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame
