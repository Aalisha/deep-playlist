You tell lies when the truth will do
You are the social chameleon
What on earth we gonna do with you?
Slip your neck into a rope

Show me a smile, you? d run a mile
Then you are free, so where? s the goal?
Where? s the style?
You want the dough

Got dead sea scrolls for you
And your woman too

She? s got corpses in her mouths
