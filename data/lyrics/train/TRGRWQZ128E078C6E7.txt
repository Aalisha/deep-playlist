I found love when I found you, You're the song making my life complete.
And now I can say for me there's a brighter day, 'cause I found love, baby, when I found you.
I have heard when love is new Of sunny days, time never ends.
And now it's so clear that my sunny day is here, 'cause I found love, true love, when I found you.
All alone, so sad, I rubbed in all my enptiness.
Then you touched this lonely heart, giving me a fresh new start.
