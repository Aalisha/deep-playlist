Do you ever listen to the sounds that your hands make?
Did you know that we could make sounds?
I don't know what the palace knows,
But I don't run with sheep, the shepherd can't herd me.
My feet ever slow with the age that takes me,
I'll slip out to the mountains where nobody knows me.

I will make my home here,
I will make my home here,
I will make my home here.

Grow a field of plenty to hold me tight,
And keep us warm from the cold that burns me.
My feet ever slow with the age that takes me,
