Girlschool - Take It All Away


One day you're up, next day you're down,
Nothing you can do but just stay around
Trying to do your best, hoping they're impressed,
But can you hurry up
'cause you wanna know who's next

Oooo, they're gonna take it all away

Loved you last night, loved you yesterday
But you'd better be careful just what you say
Saved all my money, saving that's a drag
But I never let them see you when you drive up in your
Jag
