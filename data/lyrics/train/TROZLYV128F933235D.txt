I need a new direction to get me around.
You don't have protection as you're coming down.

Light my white candle keep me safe.
It'll put that smile back on my face. ya.

Have you made up your mind?
It's the only way.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?
I admire the time that you take.
Have you made it up? Have you made it up?

I still think we should meditate.

I need a good luck charm to give me good luck.
I need a good alarm to wake me up.
