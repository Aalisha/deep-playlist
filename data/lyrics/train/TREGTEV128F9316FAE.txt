It's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right
You can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe in me, oh

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right
You can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
...
