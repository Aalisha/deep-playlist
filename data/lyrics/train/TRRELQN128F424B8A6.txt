Well I own this feeling
And I rode the sky 
And I have no reason to reason with you

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you lowered, 
and I understand that I've never let it go

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered,
But I understand the world does what it does

You never did learn to let the little things go,
And you never did learn to let me be.
