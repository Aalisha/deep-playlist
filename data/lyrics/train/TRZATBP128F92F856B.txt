Feelin' like, feel like nah nah nah, all I hear is blah blah blah
What's it like to have everything, and then wonder who you are
Realize, you're not the only one, take a number stand in line
Don't look down when you fall, it's just a waste of time

Release your mind

Feel the flow, just let go, look inside everything'll be alright
Feel the flow, don't you know, every day is ours to taste
