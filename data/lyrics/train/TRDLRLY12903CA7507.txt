Unfaithful backstabbing coward
I'm fucking sick of all the lies and all the treachery
I was always by your side and this is how you repay me
And after all these years you fucking turned your back on me
I can't believe I ever considered you family
I will never forget this knife you placed in my back
Recreant
Say it to my face
No more fucking games
This is where you pay
