I don't know why I keep coming here
We do the same thing every time
I admit, I kind of like it that way
I wouldn't worry 'bout it, it's alright

I don't know why
It would be one thing when it's not
How could it be one thing?

I'm not selling lies
I am on a last chance, baby, one shot
We only go around the world one time
And if I wanted to I could do anything
Yeah, if I wanted to I could do

But I, I thought we were fine
I thought you were mine
You caught me with my guard down
