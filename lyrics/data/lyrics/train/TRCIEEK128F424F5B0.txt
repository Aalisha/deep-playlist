Children playing in the upstairs room
TV screaming out the news at noon
Laundry blowing in the western breeze
Wind rushing through the autumn leaves

Your sweet voice saying come to bed
Is like a whisper dancing in my head
Soon the feeling of the fantasy
Becomes a bittersweet symphony

Where I can hear the music playing
And I can feel the sunlight of your smile
Baby could you hold your heartbeat
Closer to the phone
So I can hear the sound of home
