Hope you relate to me when I say 
I wont let you out my mind 
I had a little dream and the dream went like this 
A little bit like this I had a little dream 
And the dream went like this 
I saw two little girls sittin' both without a wish 
Saw through Your heart 
Through Your very eyes 
To the hole the size from lies 
Oh yes indeed 'cause things have been mixed and twixed 
In with the recipe and it's gotta be fixed 
Oh ya I'm talkin' to you and me 
...
