Walking the streets at night alone
Thoughts in dementia keep you going
No outlet you can't seem to find
A place to rest your head tonight

Feeling down and out
Feeling there is no doubt
Someone must pay the debt of pain

Nothing will stand in your way
Infected by the power that preys
On feelings driving you insane
...
