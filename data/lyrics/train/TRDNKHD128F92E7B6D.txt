Someone said there's a lost horizon
We must find a way to the throne
Take his gold and the bed that he lies on
No mercy from hearts made of stone

Before the fall we were only dancers
Angels gliding over the floor
Time stood still and we were sure of the answers
We waited but some wanted more

High above the world we had it all
So no one seemed to care when evil came to call
And soon we knew temptation and we sinned
Then he closed the door we can't come back again
