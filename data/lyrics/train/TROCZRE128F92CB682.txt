His name is Johnny he's got nothing to say
He's just a bad ass motha gettin in your face
you better hang your head low, low to the ground
cause were droppin mad tracks until were feeling the sound
It's the rhymes and rhythms that your used to
with the one-two beats you can dance to
and to the people everywhere in the streets
doin time in the jail aint whatcha wanna do
cause your runnin' with a gun
...
