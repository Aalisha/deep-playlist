There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go 
 Pretty baby you are the soul that snaps my control 
Such a funny thing but everytime your near me
I never can behave
 You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic 
 There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
 Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to 
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
 Oh, is there wonder why
