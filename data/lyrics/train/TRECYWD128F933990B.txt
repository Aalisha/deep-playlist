...
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
...
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
...
I never had the least notion
...
That I could fall with so much emotion
...
Could you coo, could you care
...

For a cunning cottage we could share
...
The world will pardon my mush
...
Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
...
