I stand firm for our soil
 (A source)
Lick a rock on foil
 (Nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me
 (They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in ecstasy

Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
 (Been livin' on a study)
If you believe or deceive
Common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life

And when you walk
Do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take furthur evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge
 (Shrug)
So judge me for labour

The bond on me ensures my good behavior
 (Lobotomy)
