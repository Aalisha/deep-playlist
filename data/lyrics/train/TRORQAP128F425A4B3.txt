She wants to dance
She wants to dance with me
Oh yeah (dance with me)

There's a girl I've been waiting to see
And I really get the feeling that she likes me
'Cos she said so, but not in so many words
I've got to tell you what I've heard

She don't want no wild romance
When she's with me she only wants to dance
