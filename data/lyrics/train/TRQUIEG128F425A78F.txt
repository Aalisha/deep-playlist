Every day I write the list
Of reasons why I still believe they do exist (a thousand beautiful things)
And even though it's hard to see
The glass as full and not half empty (a thousand beautiful things)

So, light me up like the sun
To cool down with your rain
I never want to close my eyes again
Never close my eyes
Never close... my eyes

I thank you for the air to breathe
The heart to beat
The eyes to see again (a thousand beautiful things)
...
