Touch me 
I am losing shape 
Look I am invisible 
Can you say my name 

If there's a perfect sky that we came from 
We'll be like stars forever shining on 

Catch me 
I am almost there 
How can I be near 
I am highspeed 
I am everywhere 

I couldn't catch your smile 
You are blinded by another side 
I couldn't say goodbye 
You are traveling at the speed of light 

You and me 
We never cross the boundary 
That's how I know you 
I can hear you say 

You and me 
We never unweil mysteries 
Once you are shining 
...
