Dark clouds
On the horizon
Like thoughts
Within your mind
Deep within
Cold and darkness
You know it's our time

The world goes on
Wthout you
The evil survives
The world weeps more
Day by day
No one even tries

Life foreclosed
And payment is due
It's the end
For me and you
Lie in destruction
seduction
The cries

We are the destroyers of life
We are the bringers of pain
We are the last ones alive
...
