You have to do it on your own, I can't aid you any more
And you must learn to breathe alone and all this is yours

Your shoulder's strong, so come lengthen your stride
When you're alone, oh there is light outside

But then I, I don't recall the time we spent
It's hidden in a car that sped to its death and to its rest
...
