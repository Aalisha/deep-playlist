From the point he gazed, from the choice was made
But walk the cave or the shore
The oily cave seemed to breathe on him from gravestone jaws
His little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
Somewhere a blue eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy

Footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the gray cave floor
But not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
So with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
Why on earth, as he wandered the warmth am I obeying this coin

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside, a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

Again, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea
...
