There's gonna be a party tonight
and do you think that your invited
I know that your excited
gonna be a party tonight
wouldn't you think you'd know
If you I were excited

All these consequences keep running around your head
but who knows what they'll say, when it all comes down to...
through the moonlight glow I know, heart racing fast as it can go
our eyes meet instantly, you're on your way

Let it become (don't stop) your breathing,
let it become (don't stop) your breathing,
Let's get this party started cause...

She was thinking Mr Right I was thinking Right Now.
Contemplating, over it. Over and over again.
