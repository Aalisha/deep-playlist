Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a cloudy morning
First they'll appear and then they're gone

They'll tell to you some loving story
They'll swear to you their love is true
Straight way they'll go and court another
And that's the love that they had for you

Oh don't you remember our days of courting
...
