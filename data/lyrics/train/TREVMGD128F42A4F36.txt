Sun at my window,
I'm taking this ride on my own
To be alone.

Kept me away from it,
Find me a man of the world

Guess I got my life without you,
Think I'll stay on my. on my.

Something beautiful,
I need a way it's one unhappy life.
Leaving you to her,
But if I'd stay here would it work?
Something beautiful,
