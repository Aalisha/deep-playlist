Looking for an answer to end all the violence
But you'll find no solutions behind that white paper
Looking for a way to break down that fence
Do you really belive in this ludicrous caper?
Mountbatten Murdered - A rebel gunman's been shot dead
"They're all murdering bastards" - Or was that something that I read?
Well, whatever I read - It's just the f**king same
Death, destruction, violence and pain.
This side, that side. That side, this side
What side? any side. You can't side me.
This side, that side. That side, this side
What side? any side. You can't side me.
Where could it end? What could the outcome be?
One thing's for sure
They'll be alot more corpses before the government begin to see
A lot more screaming bullets. A lot more children dead
And a lot more 'Bloody Sundays' - all painted in red.
