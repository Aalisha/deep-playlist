Where's the hurt?
For what it's worth
And where's the end improve?
Who am I?
I've realised
One and one make two

Be prepared
Stop running scared
Cos they are watching you
Yes they are watching you

I don't know what it is with me
I'm falling from my own two feet
I feel a bitter end in sight
Like a perfect world's been disturbed
I'm full of it but I can't speak
How does a body get so weak?
No colour in my black and white
Do the deepest times get much worse?
