You want me want my HEART and SOUL
Want to take me only for yourself
Hog the limelight take my TIME Tether me
And LIMIT me to my essentials
Stop! This is not my LIFE And stop holding on me
Try to confine me so I will break out
No! I cannot do you this favour My WORLD is much too large
As if it could fit in your BARRIERS
