Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it out y'all
We gonna bounce around like this
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo

First class, full blast, smash
Everything, women wiggle that ass
All my niggas analyze the color contrast
Live parallel, bound, shake control that ass

Hocus, pocus, focus
Smoke this watch Busta Rhymes the dopest
Hit y'all niggas with the bomb diagnosis
Slum Village hot shit and you know this

Now at dates we talk funny and floss money
Chippie shot that whip down when the day's sunny
Busta Rhymes and Slum Village will make a Pilgrimage
Run Detroit all the way back to the Brooklyn Bridge

Black bats and as the crime rhyme spray in my max
Spendin' my wax, I'm feelin' one time
Blow your mind, shine, blind all y'all at the same time
Regulate chickens I always come and take mine

(Do it)
What it's all about
(Stop)
What it's all about
(Do it)
What it's all about
(Stop)
What it's all about

It's on now, we worldwide, yo, crew what up? Yo
I'm every MC by the name of Jay Dee
(Do it)
Yeah that's the way it is nigga, get your money
(Do It)
Detroit the Metropolis, supply, why try ain't no stoppin' this shit

SV stay on top of this, if you're not bloppin' this niggas poppin' the
(Bleep)
It's all real, you know I ain't no approximist
Stay in the mix like apopadoppolis, get it
