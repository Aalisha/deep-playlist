Hey hey, good times

You're in so many lives
Why don't you walk into mine?
I've waited here for a lifetime
But you never showed your face
I'm sorry if I've been wasting my time
I lied to myself

I can't figure out how my story goes
But, I lie to myself
And there's no Holy Grail
So why don't you come and lay your body down
On my bed of nails?
