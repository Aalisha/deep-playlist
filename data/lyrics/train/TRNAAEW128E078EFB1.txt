You say the things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long

There you go trippin' on the things I say
'Cause things ain't going your way
Friends say I should leave
But love forces me to stay I try
Try to give you all of my time
Still I feel denied
And when we fuss and fight
I keep askin' myself why

Every single day
I pray that things will turn alright
'Cause when it seems we're going somewhere
Problems seem to arise
What must we do
Do to make each other see
This relationship should be
All about me for you and you for me

You say the things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you knew all the things I'd knew
Walked a mile inside my shoes
It could make our love flow all night long

What's the deal do you ever feel
The things that I feel
...
