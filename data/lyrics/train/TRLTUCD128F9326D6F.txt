Last night I wandered punch drunk & enraptured
Out on the beltway where the business is done
As I lay on the asphalt neath the glow of light boxesI heard somebody say bet I know where he's from

When the town is so quiet you can hear the bell tower tickin'
Out on the beltway they're sellin' the chicken
Where the tempers are short & the hours are longDarlin', won't you meet me in the old part of town?

Old part of townYou can still hear the footsteps of the old mystery
Old part of townYou can still feel the heartbeat of our whole historyWhen the heat on the street is wearin' you down
Darlin', won't you meet me in the old part of town?
