Your pushin' buttons, trying to see what I'm gonna do
Fussin' and cussin', never put my hands on you
So I'm gonna leave, 'cause right now that just seems best
I'm a grab a few things now and I'll be back for the rest

I remember good times
But the bad ones don't slip by
We just been through too much
And it makes it hard on us when I

I love you so much but I hate you right now
I love you most times but I hate you some how
I love you deep down but I hate you comes out
This love hate relationship is tearing up our house

Your calling friends, tellin' them how wrong how I am
But it's pretty much over, so I really don't give a damn
I've done my share of things to make you cry
