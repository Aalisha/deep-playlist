jettin off to the coast where the boys all taste like toast
i'm getting off to the coast where the girls all taste like scope
when i get to sacramento, i'm gonna jettison your ghost
i'm getting off to the place where the boys all taste like paste
i'm getting off to the place where the girls all get so wasted
when i get to sacramento, i'm gonna jettison your facelift
