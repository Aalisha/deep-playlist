Some things are hard to explain
And even harder to say
So I tried to put my feelings into words
It was the stupidest thing I've ever heard

(Chorus:)
'Cause I don't got no love songs
No I don't got no love songs
No I don't got no love songs
For you

I don't need to tell you how I feel
For you to know my heart's for real
So there's nothing right now I'd rather do
...
