In the passion of Your sacrifice
I saw the prophecy fulfilled
Healer of the world, the wounded cry
I heard You say come follow me
So I will, yes I will

Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill (I will follow You)
Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill
To the cross where the river runs
Crimson even still, yes I will
Follow You Lord (follow You)
I will, yes I will

On the sacred path, You bled for us
Scored and broken, up that hill
Terrible the cross, how glorious
...
