I told her, deeper than the deepest ocean
Vast as the universe, high like any mountain top
Put your world in reverse
Ain't nothing in these words rehearsed

So maybe we can make a first
Let me begin with a simple phrase
I'm a sinner for lovin' you the way I do
Life's been peaks and valleys with winds of change
Still loving you was all the same

I never believed that love could be for me
Now I see clearly you were meant for me
And now I know the truth is to be with you
'Cause I know your love will always be there

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe make it better
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

Find out how deep this love can go
'Cause there ain't no guarantee
You leave or stay with me that anyways the right way
