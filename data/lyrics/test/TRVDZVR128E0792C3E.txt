Your goal looks to be far way
Way out of your reach
Hustle, bustle another day
Hustle, bustle, hustle
And don't seem too meek
Your luck can be planned (good news, bad news)
Your luck can be planned (good news)
Don't Give In(Don't Give In) don't jack it in(don't jack it in)
Don't submit(don't submit) no don't you quit(no don't you quit)
Don't Give In, don't jack it in
Don't submit, no don't you quit
Don't Give In, don't jack it in
Don't submit, (onward) no don't you quit(forward)
