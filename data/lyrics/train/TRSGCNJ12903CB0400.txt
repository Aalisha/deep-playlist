You should've tasted the sweetest part of irony
When you tried to place your hate on me
I know it's hard for you to breathe while drowning in shallows

and protect you from the sky at night
Don't think we won't forget your words until our hearts are realised

You watch darkness creeping in fear
Sit back and watch without a care
