No more trouble in my soul
No more time to make me whole
So today I try to tell you
I'll be on my way

Show me where the answers live
Show me where the truth forgives
In my head I've tried to reason
I'll be on my way

Some say, the road is clear
Some say, confront your fears
Some say, but can you feel the love that I do?
