Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home; this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again

Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
