A painful, drawn-out death
You'll get what's coming your way
Merely a fraction of the suffering that you have caused
You've led a double life, of torture, rape and murder
Sadistic acts, carried out in bursts of rage

In this world, there's no cure for your sickness
Our time, poisoned, plagued by your existence
Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery!
