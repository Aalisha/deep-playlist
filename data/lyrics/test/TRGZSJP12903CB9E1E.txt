Ride out
The king he proclaimed 'cross the land
Tonight we strike against the enemy to capture their flag
Cry out
The tears that they shed for their brave
Tonight they ride with will, intend to kill who stand in their way
Across the fields
They march
Their task must be done
But in the end they know that this war must be won

Fight or fall
In the name of the children
Fight or fall
In the name of us all
Fight or fall
We can never surrender
Fight or fall
In the night we stand tall
