I could have found a way.
I would have found a way.

Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?

Found so many ways to hate myself.
Found so many ways to put them all away.

Don't care if the whole world falls apart.
Don't care if you hated me from the start...

You bring out the worst in me!

Pick and peel it off, this dried up skin.
Strip it away, this flesh and gore.
Open it up, the stink of you sin.
Was it holy as you hoped, at heart, at the core?

Did you want me to break down?
Did you want me to give in?
