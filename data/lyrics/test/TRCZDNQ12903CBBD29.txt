There was a time in my life
When I opened my eyes and there you were,
You were more than a dream,
I could reach out and touch you,
Girl that was long ago.
There are somethings that I guess I'll never know,
When you love someone You got to learn to let them go.

When I dream about you,
That's when everything's all right,
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever.
When I dream about you,
Girl you never go away,
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams,
Cause I still love, loving you.
