"i want to be your hero"
says the guy to the camera
moving stage right
his eyes are the only things alive
and i know who he looks like

so cheers to the ocean
tuesday's always pouring


i heard you're hurt
your heart is under my shirt
we haven't been born yet
two silhouettes
and don't forget cigarettes


a ceiling of sound
...
