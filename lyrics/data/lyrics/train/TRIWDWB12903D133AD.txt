I see you there,
like a light in the sky
Don't give up,
and I'll fight
If you show me a sign

The monkeys in exile,
they're screaming 'cause they know it's time
The city it sleeps,
Not knowing the reason why

We stop and stare,
'cause we don't know where we're going
I see the stars on the horizon
I told a lie

I see you there like a light in the sky,
Don't give up,
and I'll fight
If you show me a sign
