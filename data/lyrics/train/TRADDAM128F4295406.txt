[Intro: Spice 1]
It's nothin', you're nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', you're nothin'

[Chorus: Spice 1]
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
to a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'
It's nothin', to a boss, to a pimp, to a player
to a rider, to a sav, to a hog, you're nothin'

[Spice 1]
It's nothin' when I'm runnin' with the heater
sittin' on a twenty inch thangs
Mobbin' with the wood in the grain
can't get in the game, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
Hittin' them with the thumb and pinky ring
touched down Lex with the platinum chain
Me and my niggas known for bringin' the pain
t-a-to the brain, it ain't nothin' to the boss mayn
f-a-flossin' with the sticky green
time gets delayed with the gangsta lean
Up into the caddy when we ride for cream
h-a-hustlin' dream, it ain't nothin' to a boss mayn
