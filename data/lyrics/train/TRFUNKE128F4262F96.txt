Inna came from Mexico
She tried to find a job
She figured she? d work on rich girl's nails
That couldn? t be so hard

Inna? s got a twelve year old
And she dies inside
She can? t clear the picture from her eyes
Of leaving that little girl behind

But she? s gonna find a daddy here
And her little girl? s gonna come here too
But just like every other dream so far
She knows that one probably won? t come true
