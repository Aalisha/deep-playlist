- Esmerelda -
How can you sleep tonight
When you know that tomorrow you'll be miles away
And how can you leave if you know when you kiss me goodbye
Phoebus I'll cry
Where do I find the words
To convince you that there's a secret part of me
That dies at the thought of you leaving to go off to war
When I'm wanting you more

So while there's still time
Say that you love me
Please hold me tight
