Father, into Your courts I will enter
Maker of Heaven and Earth
I tremble
In Your holy presence

Glory, glory in Your sanctuary
Splendor and majesty Lord
Before You
All life adores You

All the earth will declare
That Your love is everywhere
The fields will exalt
Seas resound

Hear the trees, joyful cry
Praising You and so will I
A new song I? ll sing
Lord I will

Glorify and bless Your holy name

Glorify Your name

Glorify and bless Your name

Father, into Your courts I will enter
Maker of heaven and earth
I tremble
In Your holy presence
