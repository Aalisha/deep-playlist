Red Clouds

someone called about something
something's wrong today
took a walk to the fields we're under
on this beautiful day
wind sings siren's song
and the fire's just begun
two shots echoed in my soul today
it's only just begun

a man in the back said we're under attack
hey man you'd better run
there were sirens, screams and flying machines
and statues falling down

red clouds like flowers filled the sky
