It's not the pain, that I'm used to it,
It's feeling like I'm already dead,
I see from a ceiling of misty spirit,
Rising from a place in my head.

And I never even get to go down,
Down in flames.

I said, friend you have a life to see,
Why do you want to scare me so?
All the suffering and mystery me,
I can't even pretend to know.

So you never even get to go down,
...
