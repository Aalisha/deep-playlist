Not waiting for the words to come around
In this small tobacco town
And I'm hating every second of this shit
I'm far too involved to quit
But the radio keeps playing on and on
On and on and on

What in the world were you thinking?
This ship we're sinking is going down
And the water we're drinking on
Too much to bail, too much to bail out

Captain, captain!
Please save me, save me!
The neatest _ire up for hire
And the drunken liars make me want to scream

And I'm jaded by the ones who mean the most
But I'm talking to your ghost
And I'm fading like all the lies you put up with
...
