As I dissect and reform
A psychopath cankered, by parasites debilitating
The lingering corpus of a once dreaded mind, fornever

Resecting this artery infesting disease
Cerebrum excavating

So imperfect a gluttonous waste of life injected
A sycophantic pathosis
Removal of the cancer that destitutes life

Once upon the slab it becomes discernible
A conceited gob of waste churns the pica
Into a shrouded monstrosity
