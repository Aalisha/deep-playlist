It was so quiet I could hear your tabacco burn
Yet ever after all of this time, I'll still never learn
I look down at the stoop where we would sit
And the sidewalk stains where you would spit
That night was just too dark, I couldn't see
I searched in the darkness, but would you search for me?
I felt around for you, my face was warm and flushed
I didn't think that good things needed to be rushed

I feel you laughing at me, say good-bye and allow me to drown
I'm swirling around the life of a clown
