Everything, anything I see
Anything, everything I feel
Every day, any time I know
Anything, everyone has to go

Champagne lingers in my glass, party's over
I see my reflection, sipping
And it reminds me
I'd like to see you having more fun
If you can
I look at you but its me I see

Its everything I know (its me I see)
Its everything I feel (its me I see)
And its everything and everyone around me that I see
...
