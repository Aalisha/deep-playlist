Yeah ok what's up y'all
This is one of those dancing songs

We ride big big cars
And big big rims
And we rock big clothes
With them big big timbs
Got big cribs
Cause we got big crib
Im a real big kid
cause we do it real big

flow so hot
vvs diamonds in my big big watch
you know I got it on lock
keep a chick on my arm
more than the watch
she started looking at my finger
maybe because of the rocks
and now the g's on the block shock like the watch
its like a car show when I open up my garage
vipers, maserati, Lamborghini, drop tops
cuty cuty hydraulics once we drop it like it's hot
its all on tape matter fact you all are fake
so that four arm will make your head alternate
cause while you stabbing im jabbing
you get to rapping and acting
and try to make it a habit
but tricks aint for silly rabbit
flawless style will make you shake
girls cry me a river like timberlake
that's like music that's trapped in
a stereo wrapped in
a gift that you wrapped and so you aint hearing jack

We ride big big cars
And big big rims
And we rock big clothes
With them big big timbs
Got big cribs
Cause we got big crib
Im a real big kid
cause we do it real big
