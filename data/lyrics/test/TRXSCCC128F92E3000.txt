As sure as the sun rises in the East
It also sets in the West

Our sons done it, the gods never fronted
Whore nuns fuck a devil when the weight got hunted
My soul was sweeping, my mind keep stepping
In the depths of hell, yet I fell from the lesson

My soul leaves the body the situations nody
Original invisible to the ones who are tardy
A class for the better 'cause I be writing letters
Setting shit straight, one laugh at one shepherd

Her face turns purple and demons in the surb
I held my breathe and I left out the wound kinda fertile
From the East the light shines onto the West
A test for the gods 'cause that's just where they rest

A tune for serenity, fucking up the enemy
If anyone makes it, then that's the way it's meant to be
Tried her, the times of a fighter
'Cause I'll supply Phife then step out the side door

If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
Rock on, rock on

The gods keep praying, saviors ain't saving
...
