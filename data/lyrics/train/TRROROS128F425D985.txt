Can we get back to where we started
When creation lived peacefully in Your hands
Before the wars began

And all these years we have been divided
Jesus' voice has been gently calling us home
And we can't wait anymore

Lord, we feel You now
Wanting to come down and teach us how to

Sing, oh, sing
With one voice, how sweet it will be
When we sing, oh, sing
One church under one King and we will sing

Pride has no purpose in God's kingdom
Now's the time for His church to join hands again
Oh, together we must stand
...
