Can you feel it kid? Can you feel the buzz and hype?
You're like a fresh peace... so ripe.
Come close your eyes and take me by the hand.
It might feel kind of weird at first,
but I promise not to get it in your eye.
I think you're golden and I know it.

Marketing shows we might have to change your look
and I agree with them.
We think your songs might need a better hook,
I promise on the good book, it won't hurt,
...
