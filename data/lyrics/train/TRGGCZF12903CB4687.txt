evolutions been kind to you
your indeed a bright baboon
howl, moan, and forage for food
under a blood red moon
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
and no one will harm you anymore
you know how much i'd hate to kill you
so has life been kind to you
or do you feel a bit subdued
is your mind for once at ease
are you everything you hoped to be
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
shut up, shut up don't make a sound
we don't want to have to put you in the ground
