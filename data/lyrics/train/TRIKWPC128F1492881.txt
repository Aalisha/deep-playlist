People are paper mache
People and the games they play
I'm going off on a fantastic voyage
And I won't let anything bother me
We'll be too happy to worry
Living from day to day
All my friends are beautiful people
People are paper mache
People and the things they say
And I get hurt so easily
If Tracy wants to know I've gone
Before I left I paid all her bills
I finally couldn't take it anymore.
I'm tired of telling her speed kills
