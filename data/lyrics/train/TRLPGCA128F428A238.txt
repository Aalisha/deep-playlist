(...But you don't really know who I am)
Oh (You think you know me)
Who I am, who I am, no, no...
(You think you know me)

All alone in the dark
Now that our walk in the park
Has headed suddenly off a cliff

It's like you're dragging me down
Our love's six feet underground
And now I'm finding it hard to breathe

Our days have turned into mud (don't know, don't think you know me)
And now I know that I'm done

You never call me by name
Think I want you to change
You think you know me
But you don't know really know what I mean
You say I take it too deep
