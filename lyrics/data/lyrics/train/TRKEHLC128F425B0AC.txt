Out on the road 200 days a year
Blowin' smoke and grindin' gears
My bones are achin' from this Northern cold
Baby's cryin' on the telephone
Momma says I've been gone too long
The whiskey I've been drinkin' alone is sure gettin' old

This old highway don't seem to end
Countin' the days until I'm home again
Bus wheels turnin' from town to town
I wish I could set this circus down
I've had enough, I'm punchin' out
'Cause this whole thing
Is headed south
Headed south

One more night at the 8 Days Inn
I need to hold my baby again
These four damn walls
