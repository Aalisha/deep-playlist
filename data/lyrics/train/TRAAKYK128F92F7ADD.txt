I've watched you all these years.
You have always been
Beautiful
Beautiful

I had a dream,
An awful dream.
You changed yourself,
And said you did it for me.

I've watched you all these years.
You have always been
Beautiful

These rivers flow again
I'll take you down to
The warmest place
Where you remain
Where you remain
