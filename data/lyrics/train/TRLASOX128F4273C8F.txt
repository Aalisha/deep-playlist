Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your
Brain, in your brain
And feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in your
Veins, in your veins

Love come quickly
'Cause I feel my
Self esteem is cavin' in
It's on the brink

Love come quickly
'Cause I don't think
I can keep this monster in
It's in my skin

Pah pah
Pah pah

Love and other socially acceptable emotions are
Morphine, they're morphine
Cleverly concealin' primal urges often felt but rarely
Seen, rarely seen
...
