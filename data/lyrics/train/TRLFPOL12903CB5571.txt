For as long as I remember
Ever since I was a child
I've had the understanding in my heart
That there is a Creator, a Master of design
Who hung the moon and every single star

But the greatest revelation that I could ever know
He loves me in my weakness
And calls me His own

(chorus)

I have a hope, and I believe
My faith is alive, my spirit is free
Though He's unseen, still I know deep within my soul
