I've never been so happy to see a photograph of me
then when graced with your company.
You're making a small chang to the way
that you wear your heart.
I like it better... I like it... I like it better now

()
I'll swing from a streetlight
as i will sing oh, oh, oh
and I'm stuck in the meantime
but we're so, oh close
