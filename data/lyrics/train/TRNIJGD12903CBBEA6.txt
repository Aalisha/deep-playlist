My past has followed me and
I just can't get away
I'm not the same as I was
Leaving my disarray

Take me just as I am
(I'm broken down)
Pull me into your arms
I'm hanging on to every word

Save me from losing myself
I'm hanging on by a thread
Can you see who I am
Underneath my scars?
I'm afraid to fall
So I'm holding onto you
No, I won't let go
I'm hanging on by a thread

I still can hardly believe
...
