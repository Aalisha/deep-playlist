I told you, baby, how I feel
One word can close this deal
Baby, be my queen of hearts
Please gimme that love you've got
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, Kiddio
 
Maybe I'm just wastin' time
Can't get you off my mind
You could make me feel so good
I know you could if you only would
a-won'tcha say yes?, don'tcha say no
Make me feel good, Kiddio
