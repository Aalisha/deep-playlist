[Opio]
High up.

[Chorus: Opio pausing between words and syllables]
They - want - to - fuck - my - high - up
Like - when - the - thugs - get - violent
I per-se-ver but - I - get
Fru-stra-ted and - lose - my - cool - some-times
They - want - to - fuck - my - high - up
Man this bitch - just - won't - be - quiet
I per-se-ver but - I - get
Fru-stra-ted and - lose - my - cool - some-times
Sometimes.

[Opio]
These jerks I see, irkin me, Hercules, musclehead
Niggaz at the front, of the club, askin for dub
I'm like man, show me love, let me in you know I'm
S.O.M., the rest of them, rappers don't be makin money
for yo' club, but I do
You should re-spect game but see you flashin
Fools in the back, will, just, smash in
Unexpectedly, bet you see
Twenty niggaz comin to the bar
Mashin on, all the Cristal
