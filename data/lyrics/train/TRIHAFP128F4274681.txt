On my way up north, up on the Ventura
I pulled back the hood and I was talking to you
And I knew then it would be a life long thing
But I didn't know that we, we could break a silver lining

And I'm so sad
Like a good book I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

Things you said that day up on the one-oh-one
The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us, you said that you'd take it
As long as I could, I could not erase it

And I'm so sad
Like a good book I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

And I ride along side
And I rode along side you then
And I rode along side
Till you lost me there in the open road
And I rode along side
