The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
'Cause nothing seems so truth
When I'm beside you
And my dream
Of all thing is all in my hand
Naked, perfect, so beautiful

the way

The way you look at me
The way you touch me
The fire are in your eyes
(I swear) Makes me shivers inside
There's nothing I can do about it
'Cause nothing seems so truth
When I'm beside you
And my dream
Of all thing is all in my hand
Naked, perfect, so beautiful
...
