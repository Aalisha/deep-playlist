So I get a call the other day
Just about to take off on a flight to L.A.
Something in my spirit didn? t want to hear it
Can? t be that urgent, it? s gotta wait

They were trying to say
That someone very close to me had just passed away
You? ll never have another chance
I said all that to say, don? t wait another day

When was the last time you took a minute to show Him?
When was the last time, you realized You owe Him?
Your life is not your own, You didn? t get here alone
Let me put something on your mind, tomorrow? s not yours or mine
Don? t wait, don? t let this be the last time

You say you're always running late
You need a little more time in your morning, just to pray
I? ll do it when I get home
