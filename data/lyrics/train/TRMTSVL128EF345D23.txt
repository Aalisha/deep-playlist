You claim to be freed
to see the need for a change
so isn't it strange
that you're just the same
it's lame, you cannot explain
half of the things that you claim are the answer
it can't take this
we must break this
you don't think, just obey
you swallow every word they ever say
this ain't no fuckin' different way
...
