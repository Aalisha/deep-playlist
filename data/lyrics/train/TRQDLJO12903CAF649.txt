I knew it would be so simple
To never count the things you've had
You traded all your memories to
Appreciate it all without your mind just feeling
Without your mind just feeling trapped

I hope it's not the last

Don't take your chances with circumstances
I know you're better than that

The thought of being so alone
Takes away from what you swore you could've known
I can't hear you speaking
I'm still not competing with you, with you
...
