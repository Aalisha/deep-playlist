At birth Mom and Papa called their little boy Ned
They raised him on the banks of the river bed
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my Papa and my Mama and me

The clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cookin' Papa something to eat
At half past, Papa, he's ready to go
He jumps in his piro headed down the bayou

He's got fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana river
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He set the traps in the swamp catchin' anything he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
