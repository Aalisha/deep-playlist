Put a man on the moon
And a kid in college
Get you four new tires
And your pickup polished

A little white house outside of the city
Or a big old chair on the House Committee
It'll put you up on top of the world
Or six feet in the ground
(It makes the world go 'round)

Money
Nothin' but money
Money
Nothin' but money
I work all day
Sweat and slave
...
