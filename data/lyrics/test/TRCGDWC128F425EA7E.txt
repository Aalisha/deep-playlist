When the time comes
You're no longer there
Fall down to my knees
Begin my nightmare
Words spill from my drunken mouth
I just can't keep them all in
I keep up with the racing rats
And do my best to win

Slow down little one
You can't keep running away
You mustn't go outside yet
It's not your time to play
Standing at the edge of your town
With the skylight in your eyes
Reaching out to gods
The sun says itâ€™s goodbyes
...
