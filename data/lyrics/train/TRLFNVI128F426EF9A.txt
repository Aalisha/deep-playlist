Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
Why not me
Girl there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me
I'm here to give you all you dreams
I'm dedicated
No time wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

It ain't a thang
I'm far from lame
Girl it's all to the good
You're playing hard to get now
That's probably why you're by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by
And you persist to try to entertain
All of them thing that you probably just heard
None of it's true and that' my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go
Tell me why

Why not me
Is that I'm too ghetto for you
