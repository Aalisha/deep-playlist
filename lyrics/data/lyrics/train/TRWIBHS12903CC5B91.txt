Hold up, bitch, I'm holding a four fifty
You'll sure get your whole body throat sliv
With a switch blade you'll get your whole throat slit
You better watch your mouth because you know who I roll with

I'm not talking about this rap shit, I'm talking about this gat shit
When I see your soul, I'ma snatch it
Fuck around and end up inside of a casket
I'll brace them like Jason Voorhees with a hatchet

Some people think I need some help, but I'm way past it
Locked in a padded cell, screaming with a straight jacket
I'm haunted by several spirits of dead poets
I think I'm Edgar Allen Poe, but I don't know it

So don't quote it, I'm not sure who even wrote it
