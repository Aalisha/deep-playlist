I'm crazy, crazy, I'm the boy
Who defies all, yeah
Lift me higher, than anyone
And hold me arms, yeah

Woman, woman, she out of mind
And simply out of soul, ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
She gets me higher than anyone
And I miss her so, so do it, I miss her so

Stargazer you call the shots and I'll take all
Stargazer won't you kick with me, ohh, please
Stargazer you call the shots, I take all
Stargazer won't you kick with me, ohh, baby please
