You can reach me by railway
you can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane
you can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
just get here if you can

You can reach me by sailboat
climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow
into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
