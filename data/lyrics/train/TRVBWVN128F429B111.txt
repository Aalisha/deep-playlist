A savage thought becomes him
By the light shining through her dress
The flesh under his finger nails
The lips upon her chest
And with the night pressing on
She weakens behind his eyes
She urns for him inside her
Collapsing by the bedside

You want more
You got more
Cant be too safe girl
Its alright
Just undress
Her lips and
His caress

Will unveiling the curves of our bodies
(We get along, along so well)
A parasitic feeding
Off of the blood of someone else

Two bodies lie shackled
...
