i paint myself a window
in this world of your conception
where it all comes down to you
you knew if you conceived it
you knew i would believe it
you knew that you would paint me into your world of blue

i got a? to find
cant get you out of my mind

you call it something to say
you call it nothing to lose
you call it anything but the truth
suffocation in words
your isolation disturbs
i can hear your voice as it echoes on

so bury over and over
the songs you sing inside my head
i don't wanna lose
what you left inside of me cause it's all i own of you
