Walk with, with me. I'll be your Shadow God
For now, just now. Give your life to me
Your hope, your hope. I feel its steady hand
Your heart, your fear. Take off and flee

Trust me, just me. I'll catch you if you fall
My arms run deep. Run unto my call

I'll lead you into danger
And all that troubles man
I'll lead you far from hunger
Just take my frozen hand

You'll want the world to praise you
And gather at your feet
You'll want my blinding light
...
