I've seen men look at before
And they think, I don't see them
I'd like to think, it makes me proud
But I'm only fooling me

I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere

She's acting single
I'm drinking double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
