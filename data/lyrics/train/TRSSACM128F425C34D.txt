Here we are again, all alone
Passion is yearning, a burning fire of pure desire
It's so right, really special tonight
And I find that I'm needing more and more
And more and more

I need more of the night to hold you
Give me more of the night to love you
Give me more of the night to hold you
In my arms, in my arms
