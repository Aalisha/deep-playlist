You got me going, so get me out of here
I should be blowin', in someone else's ear
I'm looking forward to looking back
On days like today
Though I wish you would go away
Stay, won't you stay
I'm gonna crawl, cra-ha-hawl, cra-ha-hawl
I never felt better just crawling home
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone
