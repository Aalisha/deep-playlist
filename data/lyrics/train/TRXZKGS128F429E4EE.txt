I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
I'm tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new

I don't know who you are
But I'm, I'm with you
I'm with you
Hmm hmm hmm
I'm looking for a place
