Why be a big man
You know that you're blue
You know that it's true
Tell her, tell her, ahh, ahh, ooh)

Tell her for me, I'm tired of crying
(You love her, you know you still do)
Tell her for me, I'm through feeling blue
(Then why do you think of her
The whole night and day through)

Yes, you can say that I'll never cry again
Never beg for another chance
