[Yo, turn me up in my microphone so I can Bless God's people. You know Kirk Franklin and Toby Mac on this gospel train. Now tell me you wanna ride BABY! BABAA!]

I got a ticket, I got a ticket
I got a ticket to ride
(I gotta a ticket to ride to the other side)
I got a ticket, I got a ticket
I got a ticket to ride

Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train
On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train
Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train
On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train

Sit back, relax put on your travelin' gear
No need to doubt so put aside your fear
Destination, out of this atmosphere
It's the J-Train baby, we depart from right here

No lines to fight no ticket to price
I'm rollin' first class 'cause I've seen the light
Try as you may but your money can't buy
A ticket on the J-Line to the other side
