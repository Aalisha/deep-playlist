A sleepy loft attired in haze
Subsiding in the maze
Within a weedy bog
Nocturnal flies knock on a pane
A scintillating stain
Embossed in lardy fog

Behind an aluminic hatch
Inside a shell
Below a tumbledown thatch
In blinded cell
An alchemist with paly face
Surrenders to grief
Fumbling a spiritless leaf:

[Pre-chorus:]
"All my efforts were in vain
The dryads laugh at me again
Again and again...
