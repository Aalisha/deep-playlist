Captured my heart, captured my memory
Captured a time for me, I could see
A time for me was gonna be
Deep in my heart, deep in my memory
Deep in a part of me, heart of me
Meant to be history
Could it be that I'm still wondering

I never knew what had happened to me
I didn't think it was true
That I could be just like anyone else
I'll take my chance with you
