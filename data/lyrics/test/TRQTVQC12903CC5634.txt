Caught in the moment,
I'm lost in the past,
I'm afraid of the future,
it's moving much too fast.
The lights of today
have started to dim
The lights of tomorrow
soon will begin.
The things we shared,
the memoriesâ€”
They stood against
what was meant to be.
Time will tell me
if I'm right,
but I lay awake, thinking of you tonight.

I try to forget
that look in your eyes
The tears I shed,
as I watched you cross the line.
You'll never know,
...
