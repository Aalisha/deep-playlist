Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

You don't have to read my mind
To know what I have in mind
Honey, you oughta know
Now you move so fine
Let me lay it on the line
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show

Now it's up to you
We can make a secret rendezvous
Just me and you
I'll show you lovin' like you never knew

That's why I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
