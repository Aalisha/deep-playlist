I've got ladyfingers baby
I got kid gloves
Baby, I've got heart

If you need me to be sweet
Then I can give you what you need
'Cause I know you never came first baby

I'm so tired of my guns and my vanity
I'd like to trade them in for some sanity
And I know, it didn't come too easy

It didn't come easy to me either
From the freezer to believer in love, in love

Well, I got ladyfingers baby
I got kid gloves
Baby, I got heart, I got heart

I got ladyfingers baby
I got kid gloves
