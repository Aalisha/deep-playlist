I have lied and I have listened
I've been tired and I've been christened
I don't wanna stay here anymore
I have taken all for granted
I have raved and I have ranted
Never asking why or what it's for
I've said too much
I've seen too much
I've lied too much
Been getting high too much
But I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tomorrow
So cross my heart
And hope to die
If I don't fall apart tonight
I'll be coming home
I'm coming home
Tomorrow
The road back home is long and winding
The heat is strong the light is blinding
Faces that I know from long ago
...
