Radio
An insidious form
Helping shape thoughts
Making You conform, Programming Music
Easy Listening
Helps you to achieve
That moronic grin
Playing you
Regurgitated Pap
Selling products
That are mostly
Crap
Rarely hearing music
You wanna hear
It has an effect
Over all these years
Why don't you think for yourself? Live in this self made Hell...
Television
