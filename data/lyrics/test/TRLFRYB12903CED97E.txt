At first when you walked by my house
I never realised
That you were gonna change my life
You caught me by surprise
We talked, we laughed, we played, we stayed
Together since that time
And now you've got me flying high
On cloud number nine
-
CHORUS (2x)
I'm so stuck on you
Every day of my life
I'm so stuck on you
From morning till night
-
I can see heaven in your eyes
You've got me hypnotized
I walk in circles, I'm so high
...
