On the streets of this town
There is no surrender
They've got a number for every name
Buildings and shopping malls
Seem like a stage for pretenders
They criticize the clothes you wear
They try to make you feel like a stranger
Cause you do things they wouldn't dare
Who cares who's right and who's wrong
Because we know where we belong
The wild heart is calling us
Out in the night
A primitive love in your eyes
And out on the wasteland of broken dreams
Go you and i
We're the restless ones
(oh)
Oh yeah
The restless ones
Step outside of yourself
And you'll see through the changes
Leave your mark
