There's a train leaving town, If you hurry up I think you just might make it
Dammit I hope you make it
Conscience is a faint, unpleasant sound, You've worried enough, but here's your chance so take it
Dammit I hope you take it
A heart attack is sleeping in your chest, waiting until the timing's best
So make a move, while you're still breathing

Say so long to innocence
From underneath the evidence
You taste like Heaven, but God knows you're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
You're built for sin
