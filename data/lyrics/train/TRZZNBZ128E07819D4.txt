Lord, I've been trying
Trying to keep myself from crying
And it gets hard, there's no use denying
There's been some nights when I did a little lying

Sure feels like I've been here before

Captain tell me where I've been,
Are there waves left there for me?
Is there something left to see?
Is there something left to be?
Oh I know that I'm holding on but I've got time to grow
