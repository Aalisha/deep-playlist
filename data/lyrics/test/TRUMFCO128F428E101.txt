I'm feeling my mind is
Blowing me out of place right now
I cannot deny it
So I won't and I keep defying

Those lies you toss, your fake love's a loss
Is why I can't rely and have no trust
In you - yes, it's true, I'm thru with you
Cause if I look back this ain't straight out of the blue

Hah - you don't have a clue - but - what's up
With all of these times when you never stood by me
You never been with me, you never said once at all that you'd miss me

I can't deny it's true - I can't rely on you
