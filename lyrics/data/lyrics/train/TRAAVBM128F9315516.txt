welcome to my party-o
welcome to my party
people here we go
oehoehoeoh

welcome to my party-o
welcome to my party
people here we go
oehoehoeoh

welcome to the place we're born and raised
taking you back to the homebase
where we first started untill we got it
this is the city where we first charted
and it's not about fly gear,
about the money you make or the close you
wear
its all about how you feel it, and if you can
keep it real

so get ya groove on
and dance all night, this is your song
we'll do this right tonight,
baby baby, let's go crazy
you're welcome in soap-city
if you like what you see, come on

welcome to my party-o
welcome to my party
people here we go
oehoehoeoh

welcome to my party-o
welcome to my party
...
