We could throw these sparks around all day
'Til this fire gets hotter
We could stand right here on the river bank
Dip our toes in the water
We could sit on the fence and test the wind
Walk on the edge if jumping in
If we hesitate a moment to long
Our chance could be gone

[Chorus]
Why wait
When we can fall right now
It's love
We've been dancing around
The kind of love
People dream about
Hey-heyea

Why not
Cross over the line
I'm yours
Dont you wanna be mine
Something this good doesn't come along every day
Why wait

We could keep these words
On the tip of our tounge
...
