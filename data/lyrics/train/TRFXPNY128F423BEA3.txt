(Verse 1)
As I look back over past times,
I begin to replay through my mind.
My struggles(yeah)
Bad decisions(yeah)
Tried to bind me with blurry vision.
Now that I'm free from all misery,
and the sin that so easily beset me.
(I can see now) I can see now
got my feet on the ground.
And it's all because of you.
That I know that this is true.

(Chorus)
There's not a day that I live,
You ever failed to come through.
