The knell tolls... divine holocaust by the grace of the black moon
The apocalyptic vision for all the world to bear witness to this,
the opening of the wound
Your numinous kingdom now flows with blood
Antagonist... come forth and defy my bloodwar at the first light
of dawn
Crowned lord beheaded before me; glimpse your god dethroned
Iconoclast, the glorification of darkness
All is gone... he is dead
Pureblood of iniquity unfurl the wings of infamy
...
