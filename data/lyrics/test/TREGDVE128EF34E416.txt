I've tried to balance these lives that we are living
You always feel justified but you never feel forgiving
I woke up one morning to find myself wrapped in the things I swore I'd never touch.
And here I am again trying to save what's left of you and I
So why aren't you satisfied?

I reached out, fell short
Now you're hurt, too many words
Breaking the silence
I felt it, bled it, screamed it,
It only gets worse
And it kills me watching me too angry for us to survive
I used too many words tonight
