Well I have got some information 
No I don't know your name 
There's a party going on at Boothy's house 
1b Lyndgate Lane 
So tell somebody, to tell somebody 
To tell somebody new 
Bring a crate and some wine
Oh and you'll be fine 
Enough to see you through 
Have a drink and have a cigarette 
Drink and have a cigarette 
Kiss then ask her name 
But it doesn't seem right, it feels a little funny 
Because her sister kissed the same 
Well I sit in the chair next to the CD player 
...
