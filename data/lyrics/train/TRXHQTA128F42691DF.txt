Amor, only in a dream
I ever thought you'd find me
Amor, fell into a kiss
And left the world behind me
Easy to believe my lies you never know it
Easier to throw it away, now I look into her eyes
And I can see it, I know the reason to stay
Although they say
Deja, deja
Cuidado que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
SÃ³lo por ella
Amor, never was a touch
Enough to just persuade me
Amor, now that I can feel my heart
My thoughts evade me
