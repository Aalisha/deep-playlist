Since the world began there has been God
Many things and thoughts have changed
About the dying of our Lord
Oh, the pain that He went through for you and me
On a hill called Calvary

On Calvary my Jesus died

Oh like me

On Calvary Jesus died
He died for you and for me
He died to save a wretch undone like me
Oh, like me
