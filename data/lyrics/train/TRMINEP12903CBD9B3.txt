Feeding the needs of a desperate survival
Criminally active, not by choice
Overdosing on the mutual garbage
Skeleton the end unfolds
Empty raptured withered human
Cloaked dejection your demise
Shackled laid upon this dead prisoner
Screaming the waste, a deadly voice

Choke conjection and confusion
Surprised you're standing on your feet
Diabolic accusations
Pharisees are not to teach
Buy contempt and your conviction
Crushing others with disease
Horns are showing through the halo
Heroin is such a feast
