(Eric Carmen)

I heard my friends
Talkin' bout your reputation
All the things you used to do
They called you cheap
Said a lot of guys had had you
Girl, I don't believe it's true, no

But it's alright
I'm not in it for the glory
Yes, it's alright
Got to know the inside story
The inside story
All about your love
About your love
Talkin' 'bout the inside story
All about your love
