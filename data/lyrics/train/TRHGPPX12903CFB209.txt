The gray light of the morning
The blue-green of the sea
A leaf splashed with color
Falling from a tree

The sparkle in a diamond
The fire of the sun
They all seemed much brighter
Am I the only one?

To see them
Slowly slip away
Something changes
A little day by day

Gazing at a rainbow, a brilliant vast array
Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted or innocence betrayed
...
