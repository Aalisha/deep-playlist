I know you got all dressed up for the club
Waiting on them to come pick you up
Baby (uuhh), when I saw ya walking out the door (uuhh)
I just knew ya needed something more
Now whip it straight back to the crib eh
Finna give you something that you won't forget (no)
Baby, (uuhh) I just wanna get you out them clothes (uuhh)
I just wanna see you dance in
Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
