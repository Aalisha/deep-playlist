Don't you dare
Speak for someone you don't know
They'll feel it in the back of their throat
We know I cant construct a poem
'Cause words like girls get bored and run

And blame postmodern things I cant relate
Like summer camp and coastal states
Like alcohol and coffee beans
Dance floors and magazines
I think its safe to say I've only got
myself to blame
But boys in swooping haircuts
are bringing me down
Taking pictures of themselves
oh no

And so I walk the web in search of love
But always seem to end up stuck
I'm finding flaws in everyone.
I've reached the point where all I want
