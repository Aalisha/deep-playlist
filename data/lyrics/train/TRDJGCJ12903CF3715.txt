I will bring you gold apples and grapes made of rubies
That have shone in the eyes of a prince of the breeze.
Bright cascading crystals, they danced in the sand dunes
On the beach of no footprints to harpsichord tunes.

A throne of white ivory, a gown of white lace
Lies still in the magic of a timeless place.
One hundred small children, they laugh at the white doves
That rest on their hands with the touch of love.

And the sound of their laughter is the sound of the green sea
As it washed around the foot of the seashell tree.
If you follow the sunbeams through the valley of flowers
In the palace of the White Queen with its white jade towers.

From out of the sun a giant gull came flying
And the children got ready to sit on its wings.
They waved to the raindrops as they soared in the trees
The wind tossed their hair high, flashing gold on the sea.

They came to the castle and there they did fall,
When they saw all the sadness, through the crystal wall
The clash of bright metal brought the children fear,
But their cloaks of blue satin dried up all of the tears.

Thus children held hands and they spelled the princess name
All the golden children became a golden chain.
It lies on a white throne in a magic place
...
