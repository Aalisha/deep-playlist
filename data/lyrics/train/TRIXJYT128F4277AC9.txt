Not tonight, not tonight
Honey, I am on fire
I can't feel a single thing but the weight of the wires

Crackin' electric like
Remember baby, we were a stone
And we would sleep where we're fallin'

We would fight about it
We'd fight about it
Then we laughed about it
And we'd ride on, ride on
Ferris wheel lights on

I'd never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
