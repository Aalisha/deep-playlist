Here is a heart
Here is a heart
I made it for you so take it
Battered and braised
Grilled and saut√©ed
Just how you like it
Like it
You know I live to fill you up

Blood of my blood
Dripping with love
I bring you a thing you need most
Silent between supplies and machines
I hang in the corners like a ghost
You know I live to be seen through

No better way that I can see to spend all the time
While you're asleep
...
