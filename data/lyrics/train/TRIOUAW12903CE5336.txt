Two Tub Man
I am a pilgrim looking for danger
I am an outlaw, I am a stranger
I'm just a clown walking down the street
I think Lou Reed is a creep
I need a girl I need release

I can go anywhere, people look and people stare
They all know that I'm the one, not to let your son become
What I want to do I do, who I want to screw I screw
Playin in a heavy band, guess I'm just a Two Tub Man
