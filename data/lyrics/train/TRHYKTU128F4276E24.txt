Can you surry?
Can you picnic?
Can you surry?
Can you picnic?

C'mon, c'mon and
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Red yellow honey
Sassafras and moonshine
Stoned Soul
Stoned Soul

C'mon, c'mon and
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
