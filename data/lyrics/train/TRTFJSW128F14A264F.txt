Everyday on the news and in the papers
such depressing information
funniest time? and everybodys talking about perception
Just hold on, it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Everyone's wonderin' how they're gonna make it
don't worry we can do it.
think about all the rough times that we have been through,
we're a winner? be strong try to spun? out again.
