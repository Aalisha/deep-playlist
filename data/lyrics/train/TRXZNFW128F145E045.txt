I just can't imagine how it would be
To look in your eyes and feel misery
I can't believe what I would say
If I moved for your hand and you moved it away
Oh, and I may have done wrong
Won't you give me some time
It won't take me long
It's a yes and no game
All pain and no gain
You're here in my life
