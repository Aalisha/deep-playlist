His time with them had stopped
It's time for Him to carry out His Father? s will
He said, He? d drink this cup
He? s told them all along that He would go
They could not follow Him
But He? ll be back for them, my friend

And now He sweats these drops of blood
And He prays,? Take this cup from Me?
But He knows there? s no other way
His Father? s will, He said
He? d take your sin, your shame
Your place upon that cross of pain and die for you

There's no way to repay
All the pain He went through for you
His reason, simply His love
It's time to see the truth
Understand there's nothing you can do
