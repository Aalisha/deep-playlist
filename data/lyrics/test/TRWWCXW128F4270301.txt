Listen and hear me
there is no end in sight
Heed my advice or
Pay the price

Why are we doing it
We need to fix this situation
all we need do is act on our own education

Why don't we live till we see the end of our lies
Sit in silence wait for those to go by
Always just so full of ourselves
You don't see the beginning change

I won't try too
set an example

I won't try too
set an example
