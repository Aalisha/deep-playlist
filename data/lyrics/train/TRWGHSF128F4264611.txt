Word on the street is
You gave me this walkin' papers and
Well, I wanna be the man
That my daddy raised me to be
My momma taught me to be, see baby

Guess who loves you more?
Hey love, guess who loves you more than he did?
Guess who treats you better than he did?
Girl, me, that? s right, me
When you gon' see? Wake up and see

Guess who loves you more than he did?
Guess who treats you better than he did?
Girl, me, that? s right, me
When you gon' see? Wake up and see

Lady, lady, lady, my darlin?, darlin?, baby
I wanna restore your hope
Forget about the past, this thing's gon' last, so
I wanna try this, I wanna rock you to sleep
The right way, what I'm tryna say is

Guess who loves you more?
Hey love, guess who loves you more than he did?
