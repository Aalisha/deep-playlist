[Intro: child]
Ladies and gentleman,
Welcome to the end of the beginning,
My name is Sway,
A.k.a Little Derek.
And right now,
I'm about to take you,
To the very beginning,
Before the after,
Prior to the present,
Before the hype,
Before the magazines,
Before the buzz,
And before the mix tape,
Back to the blood, sweat and tears.

Growing up I had too much on my mind,
So I needed a way to get,
All of this crap out of my head,
So I chose music.

This is my beginning,
This is my introduction,
This is my dream.

Listen very carefully,
This is my demo.

[Sway:]
It's da arrival of Decihper,
Live from this london dungeon,
(Underground)
Dats where I've been puttin' it,
Down for my people on the,
North side,
(Get up)
East side,
(Get up)
West side,
(Get up)
South side,
(Get up)
Inside,
(Yeah)
Outside,
(Yeah)
Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up.
Un-der...
(Underground)
Dats wot I'm sayin yeah?
And for years,
Dats how long I waited here,
And I'm prepared,
Back then people never wanted to hear me though,
Dats wen I had to shoot a lil video,
Now I'm giving you the album,
Here we go!
Ever since I was a 'lil kid about 6 7 8 9 or 10,
I always wanted to be bigga than Big Ben,
But dreams can easily come to an end when your livin' in the big l.o.n.d.o.n.,
The city dat never sleeps so how do we dream?
'Lil kids forced to think like men and the big smoke just gets you lean,
To get a good start in life I took a run up instead of pickin' a gun up,
