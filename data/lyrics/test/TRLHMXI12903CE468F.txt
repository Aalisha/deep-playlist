i ve got no focus because of you
i m losing IQ because of you
you keep my head together because of you
i m a washed up loser just because of you
ive no money because of you
ive got no friens left because of you
no body wants to know me because if you
im a stranger to myself just because of you
love made me stupid love made me do it
love made me mess up everything in my life
