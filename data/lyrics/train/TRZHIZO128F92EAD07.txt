Ghost in the mirror.
Just look beyond, the balanced reflection.

So tell me dear (tell me dear), can your heart still break
If it's already stopped beating?

So tell me dear (tell me dear), can your heart still break

Never take your pulse for granted again,

Black is black and love is, love is death.
Black cats, Black hearts, the wicked never rest.
I curse the day I let you in.

So tell me dear (tell me dear), can your heart still break
