Out on the road again
Left it all behind
Another stop in a small town
Crowd on the cord up stands
Girl in white, turns around
Oh my God, she's the one
Always late in many
Passes me by

Where were you (where were you when I needed you)
Where were you when I needed you, baby
Every lonely night (every lonely night)
That I spent on my own
Where were you
