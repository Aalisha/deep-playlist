(1st verse:)

smiling.
you were always smiling
How could I have know that you were
Hiding.
your feelings from me
I wonder How could it be

your note's clear
it says you don't love me
My worst fear
is now reality

You picked a fine time
2 tell me you don't love me
You picked a fine time
2 tell me you don't care
and what I thought was love
was really just pretending
and your love for me
was never really there (never really there)
