Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(woooahhhh)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above
All the above
All the above
All the above
All the above
All the above
All the above

Listen
Really what do you see
When you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing
To me living my dreams
I done been to the bottom
I done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich
Headed straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block
Look how I rep for the hood
I get nothing but love now
When I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame
Money make all of us change
The new benz is all white
Call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes?
