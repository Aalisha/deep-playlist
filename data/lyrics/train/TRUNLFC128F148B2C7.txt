Oooh...
Eah!

Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long no
Mmmm
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now

(Ooooh)
See all these illusions just take us too long
(Ooooh) And I want it bad.
Because you walk pretty,
Because you talk pretty,
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'

(Ahhh)
Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin',
Asking for a raise
(Oooh) Well does she want me to carry her home now?
(Oooh) So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?

(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)

(Ahhhh... oh)
Come on
Oh yeah-yeah
