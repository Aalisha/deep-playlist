Sit back, matter of fact
Teasing, toying, turning, chatting, charming
Hissing, playin' the crowd

Play that song again
Another couple Klonopin
A nod, a glance, a half-hearted bow

Oh such grace
Oh such beauty
And lipstick and callous
And fishnets and malice
Oh darlin'

You're a million ways to be cruel
(One zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
(One zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel

I should, I wish I could, maybe if you were I would
