Music and lights
Forget your sorrow
let it all fade away.
Forget tomorrow
let's start living for today.
Let me take you through a night of ecstasy
I like to hear the sound of a mystic melody.
In the spotlight with the music playing loud

No distraction together we have found.
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world.
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night

Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls
