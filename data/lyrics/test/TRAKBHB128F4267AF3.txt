I'll start from the top
She was staying out all night
And I was next to the phone counting down the seconds
I know it's sick, but I can't help it
And I'm not one to jump to conclusions
But I need this prescription to help me find a solution

And I keep your words written on my arm
To bare the truth and remember what you are

Doctor you gotta listen
My heart stopped beating when she said she adored him
So find a scalpel and cut in deep
I gotta get her ghost out of me
Doctor listen listen
Put me under and start the incision
Find a scalpel and cut in deep
I gotta get her ghost out of me tonight

So rip me open
Pull out my organs
There's gotta be a part of me that isn't so forgiving
And I'm not one to be so obsessive
