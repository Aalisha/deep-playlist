Glory to glory, glory to glory
Glory to glory to God
Glory to glory, glory to glory
Glory to glory to God

Glory to glory, glory to glory
Glory to glory to God
Glory to glory, glory to glory
Glory to glory to God

To the only God my Savior
Be majesty dominion and power, yeah
Forever and ever and ever
Forever, Lord I want You to be glorified
