Crazy Love
Here we go again
My heart keeps giving in
To you and your crazy love
It's back to this again
My heart keeps giving in
To you and your crazy love

I hadn't heard from you in a while
Since I said it was over
So when you called me the other day
It was a total surprise
You said you still love
Miss me need to be with me
But the days are still passing by
In three months I'll be hearing that same ol'thing
That's how I know it's all lies

Here we go again
