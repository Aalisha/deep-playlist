You gotta leave me now
You gotta go alone
You gotta chase a dream
One that's all your own
Before it slips away

When you're flying high
Take my heart along
I'll be the harmony
To every lonely song
That you learn to play

When you're soaring through the air
I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
When you come back down
When you come back down
...
