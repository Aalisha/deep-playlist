Gotta go, gotta go
Go your own way

What's it all about
What're they saying now
that I'm not good for you
But they don't know I'd be there for you
How I care for you
Truly doubt for you
But it's clear that

I know if I push
I push you away
So I give you time
I hope you decide what we feel is right
Can't make up your mind

Gotta go your own way
Go your own way
If you're feeling doubt
Baby work it out
Gotta go your own way
...
