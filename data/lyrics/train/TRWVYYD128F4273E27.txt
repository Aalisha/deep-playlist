Full, full moon and that same sad nature
I wanna cover every inch of you like ink on a paper
Like the blind parade of souls consumed by religion
I can't wait 'til I get you in that defenseless position

When we set the prairie on fire
Oh, we go down to the water naked and slow
You and me and the heart of desire
We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow
How far will it go

When this feeling burns down to one solitary color
The velocity of longing melting into each other
It's a song our fingers play all at once and together
