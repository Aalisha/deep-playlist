If you lose your money, don't lose your mind
If you lose your money, don't lose your mind
And if you lose your sweet woman, well brother you better not mess with mine

If you ever been down, I know you know just how I feel
If you ever been down, you know just how I feel
Why I feel just like a dyin' soldier, across the battlefield

Baby I'm goin' out west, and don't wanna leave you behind
