I'm fallin for you
Boy the things that you do
Make me feel like I'm one with the world
I'm falling for you
Boy my heart will be true
Just as long as I'll be your girl

Remember lying awake
Praying for a man like you
Wishing my fantasies could somehow someday come true
I wanted someone who would appreciate the things I do
