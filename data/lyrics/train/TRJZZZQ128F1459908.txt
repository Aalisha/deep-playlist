I stood under ohio's skies
I could see the open fields for miles
I thought "what the hell am I doing back here again?"
but now I'm trying to reassemble the things I kept and
the pictures fade but I hope to resurrect
the things that kept me sane back then

in the backyard playing on the swingset
dark green shoes off you can get your feet wet
mom and dad sat quiet in the sunroom
sundown, big moon, big sky.

now I just want to live a normal life
get a fast car and a pretty wife
we could have children of our own
settle down here until they're grown
we could buy a house out on the beach
and just die there, out of reach
do you want to live
do you want to live
do you want to live a normal life with me

live
a normal life with me

for years I cursed these dead end streets
...
