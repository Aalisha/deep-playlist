We've been told to live our lives just workin' on the feelin'
Waitin' for the sun to shine on what we do believe in
In every man I hear the cry of someone else
A drownin' man reachin' out but no one hears
I know a man livin' out his life without a reason
And he says

Monday's got a beautiful baby
And Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child, he was born to give

Now what about all the unborn people that will suffer
