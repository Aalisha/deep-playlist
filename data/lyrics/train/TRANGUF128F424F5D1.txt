I’m going through changes again,
living in dangerous times
Looking through different eyes,
and I’m all alone again

Each time I promise myself
To hold on, hold on
I keep it inside, that’s been the rule
Now all I see is I’ve been a fool

It should have been you who turned my world around
You promised you would,
It should have been you,
Give me strength to survive and keep hope alive
