Love, lovely love,
You got a way that's so exciting.
I don't mind the pain
Of that burning flame.
You know it's true,
I've got the feelin' too.
Hey, why don't you take
Whatever you want from me?
I'm in the mood
For all the lovin' that I can't see.
Is this for real now?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?
Love, lovely love,
You movin' sweet inside of someone
Comes a thunder rain
And a hurricane.
It's coming thru,
Straight from me to you.
Why don't you take
whatever you want from me?
I'm in the mood
for all the lovin' that I can't see.
Is this for real now?
Oh, I ask you now, can it be?
...
