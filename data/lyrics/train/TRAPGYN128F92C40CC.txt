Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I've been without, a lot of things
And in my mind, I'm questioning
And if ever, he will leave my side
Don't know how I'll make it, how will I survive

(Ay)
And then I heard
(Ay)
You in my ear
(Ay)

Sayin' it's okay, don't worry I am here
(I am here)
Don't know where I, would be today
If you would ever, take your love away

Your spirit away, your spirit away
Don't know how I can make it
From day to day, don't take it away

I promise you that I will do it better
I promise, I will get myself together
Don't take it, don't take it
Your spirit away

Now I'm a man, with many dreams
...
