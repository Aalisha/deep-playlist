If you take your love from me,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.

I need your love in every way.
Your love I cling to
When things slip away.
Without your love
I'll be lost and alone.
No reason for living
All purpose would be gone.
Without you there
For my eyes to behold
My life would be empty
My heart would grow cold.

If you take your love from me,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
