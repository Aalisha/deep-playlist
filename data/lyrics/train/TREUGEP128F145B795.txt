Grab my knee and look at me
And try to tell me, I'll be home soon
Asleep in my bed and unstoned
I'm tired of me this way

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish I had for winter

It's not as gentle as it sounds
As though it sounded yesterday
