There's too much sky and not enough blue
There's too many questions to why I love you
There's too many clouds and not enough sun
The rain must fall on everyone

I'm fire and you're the ocean
I'm energy and you're the rhythm
Love is somewhere in between
What you believe and what you dream
I'm just trying to make you mine, you're the ocean

There's too much doubt and not enough dare
There's too much decision everywhere
There's too much talk and not enough time
Let's close our eyes and not our minds
