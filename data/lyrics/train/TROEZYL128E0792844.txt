See that face from across the room
And I can feel you're nothing
Show your fear
Its not hard to see
Intention's pale, It's Blinding

Stop stop from the place I've been,
No good for the shape I'm in
I'm slow to the race you win
You wanna take me out

Stop stop with your face off in
My space and my wicked decend
No taste for the place I'm in
You need to stop, Stop

I am all you need to know
And I'm everywhere you go
No one can save you now
When it all comes around
And I'm everything you see
And I'm what you'll never be
...
