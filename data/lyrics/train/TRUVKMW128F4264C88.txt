Well the train to Grinder's Switch is runnin' right on time
And them Tucker Boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When ol' Lynyrd Skynrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
Now people down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

So gather 'round, now gather 'round chillin' get down
...
