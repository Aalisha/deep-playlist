My love, the days are colder.
So, let me take your hand
And lead you through a snow white land.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.

My love, the year is older.
So, let me hold you tight
And while away this winter night.
Oh, oh.

I see the firelight in your eyes.
Come kiss me now, before it dies.
We'll find a winter world of love,
...
