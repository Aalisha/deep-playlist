A little white picket fence around your heart
It's everything you wanted
Now it's tearing you apart
You're gonna raise a family now
But you don't know where to start
I remember you

Me I pack a suitcase
And move from town to town
A little east of Eden
Too late to turn around
Marionettes on wires
You dance out of control
I remember you

Are you crying in your sleep tonight
When you're lying with him
Do you turn out the light
Are you hiding in your dreams tonight
In your world
I will be the ghost in your heart
The ghost in your heart
...
