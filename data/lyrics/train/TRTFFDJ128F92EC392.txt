Na, na, nye
Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
N-Dubz, N-Dubz, N-Dubz

It's like first things first
You'd probably think I'm a chap with good manners
Well, you're wrong I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the worst of the worst an' I ain't boastin' 'bout my verses
I'm speaking' 'bout the way I run around snatching purses

For every meaning there's a purpose
Just because I never went to school it don't mean that I can't be perfect
For screaming' out loud we's addicted to money like two fingers tapping
On wherever there's a vein

And believe me, yeah we proud 'cause life is getting sicker by the day
And therefore we'll always stick around
Tonight you see the size of me, you wouldn't think I'm any harm in it?
Think again, I'll take your *** nicely

Chat up your wife to be, middle class, daddy's girl
I think I need to get me one and your one looks just right for me
Isn't it funny, how money can make a lot of people change?
Freakin', my friend, but I telling you, you wait

You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
'Cause all they ever do is just bring me down

So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
