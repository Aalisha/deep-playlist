If I could change the currents of our lives
To make the river flow where it's run dry
To be a prodigal of father time
Then I would see you tonight

If I could find the years that went away
Destroying all the cruelty of fate
I must believe that love could find a way
Tonight

Lonely finds me
One day you will come
But I'll wait for love's sake
One day to me, love

If I could see beyond the here and now
