I ask that you return me
The years I did ignore thee
And with my burden bury
The weight of guilt I carry
And lead me to the well of life
Before my soul departs

Now I so clearly see how I have murdered me
And I cannot fake what I tried to make of myself - a God
Please heal me

The halls of countless eriudite teeming with the self deified
Cloaked in snuffy habiliments
...
