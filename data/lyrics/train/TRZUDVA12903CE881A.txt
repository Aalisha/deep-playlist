Tonight, tonight, tonight
Heal me, heal me

Yes in the darkness of the night
I know there's someone near me
I can't explain but it's all right
As long as this won't leave me

I give to you my sacrifice
My virgin creed, my passion
I'm torn in two but all my life, my life
My life I'll wait for you

To near me
And reveal me
