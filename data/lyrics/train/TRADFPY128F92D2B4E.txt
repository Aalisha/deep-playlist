I really thought I was OK
I really thought I was just fine
But when I woke this time
There was nothing to take me back to sleep
To take you off my mind
This time

I keep saying
Over and over and over and over again
Let it rain
Let it rain
Over and over and over and over again
Let it rain
Let it rain

I need to hide within the storm
So have the lightning come
And bring the winds that scream
And spill the fog all over town
...
