Is there no one to deliver you from your ignorance?
Maybe you'll look and see there'll be no deliverance
Turn to vulture parasites who prey on lost souls
Suck the life from hapless fools who give them control

No, no deliverance
Pick your own, your own deliverance

A ticket to the depths of dogma hollow
It's them you follow
