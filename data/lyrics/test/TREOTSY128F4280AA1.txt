Lili take another walk all of your fake world
Please pull all the drugs out of your hand
You see that you can breath without no back up
Some much stuff you got to understand
For every step in any walk, any town of any thaught

I'll be your guide
For every street of any scene, any place you've never been
I'll be your guide
...
