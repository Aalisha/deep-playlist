He was a convict of his own conviction
He was in conflict of his own infliction

And the lines do draw a parallel
Right back to the place
Where the shadow boxers dance
And old memories dwell

Below the tight rope
Drawn in suspicion
Beneath the artist
Who walks in ambitions

And the lines do draw a parallel
Right between fact and fiction
So the honest truth cannot yell
over blind conviction

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Likes to be kept waiting
...
