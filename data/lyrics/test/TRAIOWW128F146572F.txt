Beach Boys
Beach
Funky Pretty
A pisces lady loves romance (she loves romance)
Her movements tell you at a glance (she loves to dance)
Why they say pisces rules the dance (she's got the glance)

She values flowers more than gold (she flows like gold)
Thinks of her men as knights of old (she's never bold)
She's very spiritual i'm told (she has never told)
Whoa

But where's my spark in the dark?
Glow glow glow c'mon glow
The funky pretty flame in my heart
Me and my pisces lady are apart

Her calender is not like ours (she rules the hours)
The hieroglyphs mark changing hours (she rules the stars)
Her guiding light is from the stars (she's got the powers)
Whoa
A book of verse a jug of wine (she's soft like wine)
She'll always tell what's on your mind (she's much like time)
By just your birthday place and time (she's very fine)
