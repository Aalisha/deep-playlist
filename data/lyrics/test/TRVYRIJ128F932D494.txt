Steel rails chasin' sunshine round the bend
Winding through trees like a ribbon in the wind
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
'Cause I'm looking out ahead to keep my mind from turning back.

If I really had you once then I'd have you when I'm gone
Whistle blowing blowin' lonesome in my mind
Calling me along that never endin' metal line.
