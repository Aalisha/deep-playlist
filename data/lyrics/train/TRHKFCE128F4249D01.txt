You know it kills me to see you crying, to think of all your love
He's been denyin' and I can't blame you for feeling cheated
Being so in love and so unneeded
But, the reason you keep trying is a feelin' that I know

Oh, I hurt for you every time, he breaks your heart
Baby, I hurt for you and it's tearing me apart
To care the way I do, baby I'm a fool
I watch you long for him and I hurt for you
