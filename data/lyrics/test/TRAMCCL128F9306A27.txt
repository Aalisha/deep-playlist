if your gonna save the day
and your hearing what i say
i feel your touch, your kiss
is not enough
and if you believe in me
dont think my loves for free
i wont take nothing less
than a deeper love

(chorus)
let me tell you, you
you know
IIIIIIIII, i need a miracle
i need a miracle
its more than physical
what i need to feel from you

tell me that you understand
and you take me as i am
