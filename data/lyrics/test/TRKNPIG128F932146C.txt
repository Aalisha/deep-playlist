Two wishes, a lifetime
A sad and real man
And hoping for money
A higher grade
The beggars are waiting
They've got enough time
Time that you are missing
But don't shout it out:

Taxi driver telling you
Nasty things you'll never do
And the thief is watching still
With that sinful tiny king
My adored beloved one
Give me kisses burning sun
Meet me later at the bar
And the devil's dancer's car
Sit down, wait and enter hell
Share the laughter, put a spell
...
