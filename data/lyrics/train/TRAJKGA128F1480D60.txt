I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
like all at once i wake up from somthing that keeps knocking at my brain before I go insane I pull my pillow to my head and spring up in my bed
screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you

This moring I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it and didn't go and shout it when you walked in to the room
I think I love you

I think I love you
