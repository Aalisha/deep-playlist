It's crazy how I'm seein u
cuz i just told your lil cousin the other day
i need to speak to you
girl how u doin, how u been
lets get all of that all the way
i got so much to say
I heard u had a baby on me
is that the truth
or is the block just hatin on me
and i aint trippin if you got ur self a man
girl cuz i can change that given half a chance

feelin me apoligize
everything i did that made u cry
i know u dont wanna hear this song
but i promise i wont take to long
i needed you to hear the rest
at least i got it off my chest
don't walk away
cuz if u do you'll miss the best part
of what i gotta say

Baby I want, to go back in time
