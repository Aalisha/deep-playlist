You see, baby
I ain't going nowhere . . . no
I'm just gon' wait on you
Girl, I swear

I'm here when you need me, you should know
I can always listen, so
'Cause, girl you're my baby (baby)
This thing that you're going through
Just do what you got to do
And love will show you the rest, girl

How much time do you need
To solve all your deeds?
'Cause I could go for a ride!
Now, tell me one thing, please
Nobody will shuffle me
'Cause we might just have a chance, girl

(Chorus)
I will wait on you, my dear
Even if it takes 1, 000 years
I believe that love will see us through
But, for right now here's what we gon' do

My friends say I'm slippin' over you
