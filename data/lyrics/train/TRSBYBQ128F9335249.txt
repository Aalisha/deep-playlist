(Verse 1)
Everybody wanna take chills
It's either that or nigga wanna play sales
Try tha floor when I bound wit a fake bill
When I see seven niggas I don't say shit
Motherfucker like me try to stay big
Who you got laying down in a "stay there"
If a whips I can do it any kind of way
From this A to the Crist to the Chardonnay
Through the belt, from tha pipe to the parkway
Everything a nigga touch is like park-ay
Get it right, bill nigga let it light
From the stand though, two mil, living life
And this chicks from the streets better get it tight
Their pussy laid out better get it right
So where we at now

(Chorus: 2.5x)
AZ's back (come on)
(Where we at now?)
Where we at?
(Talk to me, talk to me now)
AZ's back
(Ga, Ga, Ga, Ga)
Where we at?
(What you want, what you want)
AZ's back
(What you like, what you like from me now)
