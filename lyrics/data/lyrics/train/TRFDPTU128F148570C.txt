All we know will be folded. A day of clouds. Creation waitsâ€¦

Get away blue collar instrument
Get away politicians and priests
Refined to consume
It will be laid down
On the necks of the pure
The proud and the damned

Your day will come
Turn the page, embrace your
Comforting company
The sun beats down on your
Comforting company
Everything is burning because

Tonight the south is on fire!
The south is on fire.
