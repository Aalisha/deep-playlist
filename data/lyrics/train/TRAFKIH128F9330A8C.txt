I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh oh santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me

The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Oh oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
