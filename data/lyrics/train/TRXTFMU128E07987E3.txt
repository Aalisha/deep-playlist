Allowing you to pollute my space with
Ya bullshit
You been doing me wrong, I been
Unhappy with this relationshit,
Putting up with it
For way to long
I been, stooping to your level
Playing games
Going out my way to disrespect you
Though I accept that you cant do me nothing
That I aint let you do... hmmmmmmm

I been repeating myself, its frustrating
All this confrontation is stagnating
And animosities all I'm accumulating
You say you gonna change
Well I'm done waiting baby
