Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
Well, It's a miracle in itself
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help

CHORUS
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Baby what else could it be
