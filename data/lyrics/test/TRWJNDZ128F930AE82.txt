A sign is all she wants
The brand new game is up to come
A sign is all she wants
Give me the power

A laugh is all i need
To use the finger that makes her bleed
The laugh of adoration
Give me the power

Her fear is all i care
To start the disgust we must share
A state of no salvtion
Give me the power

Her lips is all I feel
...
