Baby it's no mystery
You're bringing out the best in me
And though I've been in love before
I've never had the kind of love that made me feel secure
I never thought that give and take
Mentality was right for me, mmm
You made me open up and see
That it's for real
And there's no other place I'd rather be

CHORUS:
Think about you all the time
24-7 babe
The love I have inside for you
Is more than any words can say
Pray to God on bended knee
