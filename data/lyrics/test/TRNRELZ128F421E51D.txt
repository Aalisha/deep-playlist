Legs bent and twisted up underneath me
Limbs like wood my blood flows like pitch
My body shudders and curls against your jaw
Blackened and burned in need of
A stitch or two

You sewed me up and pulled me apart
You sewed me up and pulled me to bits

Your disease comes sinking into me
Its teeth all chiseled mercilessly
...
