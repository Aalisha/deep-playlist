I've been singing rock most all my life I got three little boys and a sweet young wife
I feed 'em good cause I make good bread thank God for the man that said
Rock'n roll is the answer son you can't beat 'em join 'em
Get your guitar get your drum get your set of iron ear drums
A thousand watt column and you're in the business son
Got my first Cadillac in '54 since then I had about five more
Mercedez Benz and a Porsche too the other day I was thinking this wouldn't do
Cause the price of a Cadillac times two comes out to the cost of a Rolls Royce new
But soon the Cadillac's obsolete and the Rolls Royce is still a running sleet
Figure four years instead of two before you gotta buy something new
Put an extra fifteen hundred in to pay for the bar and air-conditionin'
You don't need no chauffer get your bartender and ride baby
So the other day I drove down from a hill went to my bank to get me some bills
And boots and Levi's worn and tan I ambled into the Rolls Royce stand
