You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You magnify the way I think about myself
Before you came I rarely thought about myself
Behind your veil I found a body underneath
Inside your head were things I never thought about
You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year

What's my view?
Well how am I supposed to know?
Write a review
Well how objective can I be?
What's my view?
Well how am I supposed to know?
Write a review
Well how objective can I be?

You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undressed
The every day is part of what consumes me
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me
I testify to having guilty feelings
