One man climbs higher then one bites dust
Thru the dark hours in dark towers we trust
Forever the rays of light will energise my
Born ability mind stability much creativity

39 steps 22 catch boxed in
Tales of the city we are lost in
Living in a haze I'm amazed by the ways in the days
Of forever go non stop pressure
The risking obelisks stands stable in the skyline
You will find icon is symbol and symbol is sign
Higher aspect looking down over the horizon
The cloud nine zero back down to the ground
