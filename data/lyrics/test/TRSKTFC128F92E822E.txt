Obsession (my heart, heart go boom, boom tap) [x8]

[Verse 1:]
Excuse me if you find this so dumb,
Looks like somebody else got my wife.
So tell me where the f*ck you came from (where you came from),
I never seen nothing like you in my life!

[Hook:]
So I closed my eyes and tried,
Not to think of your eyes,
Not to think of your smile,
And the face your making now.
You should've thought about that before,
You came strolling through the back door,
The back door of my heart,
Tearing everything apart.

[Chorus:]
I said Oh (oh)
Oh (No, No) I,
I think I'm falling for you. (I think I'm falling for you)
I said oh (oh)
Oh (No, No) I,
I think I'm falling for you. (I think I'm falling for you)
Oh No, No, No (obsession)
Oh No, No, No (obsession)
Oh No, No, No (obsession)
Hey

[Verse 2:]
Ok, I gotta tell my mom about you.
I hope this is ok in Gods light.
Yeah, he dropped you off here, but he's not through (he's not through)
Grab my hand, help me map out my life.

[Hook:]
