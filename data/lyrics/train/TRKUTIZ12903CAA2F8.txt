I don't want to think about that
I don't want to think about that
I don't want to think about that
I don't want to think about that

Don't tell me

There have been signs that I've seen
And I do believe my eyes,
My eyes can see clear as anyone's
See as clear as anyone's
And all these things don't touch me
I keep saying to my friends
I'd care if I had time to just give away
But I don't want to think about that
I don't want to think about that


I get up
I work hard
I go out
I come home
I get up
I go out
I work hard
