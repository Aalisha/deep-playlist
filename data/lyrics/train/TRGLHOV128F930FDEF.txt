[Verse 1:]
Out of all the miracles
None would ever compare
To that glorious day
Seeing the need of man
God devised a plan
To rescue right way
While the veil stood between
Earth and Heaven
He found a way
To bring us closer
Now the world would see
Just how to be made free
Oh everybody help me say...

[Chorus 1:]
Suddenly
From the dark
Came a light that would enver dim
Now the Father's favor
Would bring good will to man
Can't you see
His only Son
Peace and joy,
Yes He's the One
