One, two, three, four

Little yellow spider, laughing at the snow
Ah, maybe that spider knows something that I don't know

I said, "Dance for me just one more time
Before you hibernate and you come out a crab cake"

Hey there, little snapping turtle, snapping at a shell
Ah, there's mysteries inside, I know
But what they are I just can't tell for sure
