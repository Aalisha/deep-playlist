This is a fighting dance
And the first move is get off the floor? if you're a pig [?]
[?] And you get a point, you don't like fish, get out of this [?]
[?] And a bored girl [?], looking smart, "tear him apart"
Elimination dancing
Rule one, knock ourselves out
Rule two, giddy up, giddy up, knock out (Punch up)
Insist, persist, knock out
Resist, like this, knock out
You're gotta beat them all, you're gotta beat them all, knock out
The harder they fall, knock out

Use your muscles
