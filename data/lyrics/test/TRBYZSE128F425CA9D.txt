Don't, honey don't, go away, no no
Don't you hear, don't you hear,
What I say, what I say
Give me time, give me time
I'm gonna make your love as strong as mine
But I know Rome wasn't built in a day

Now, you know that I love you dear with all my heart
I know that you didn't love me from the start
But I planted a lil' seed in your heart I know
And it just needs time to grow, baby
