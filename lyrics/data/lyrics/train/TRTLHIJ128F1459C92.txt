He had the best of both worlds
Yours and mine
And I bet he's proud of himself
The way he split his time

Telling all his friends
How good it feels to play both ends
I'm sure in all of their eyes
That you and I are

One of a kind, a pair of fools
Two women one man's been lying to
You thought you were the only one, I thought I was too
We're one of a kind, a pair of fools
...
