there's one hand clapping and it's in my head
whack the dalai lama
he's telling me he'd be better off dead
whack the dalai lama
and he's the focus of evil in the world today
whack the dalai lama
well i'm the real dalai lama anyway
whack the dalai lama

whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack
whack the dalai lama
whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack
whack the dalai lama

he's an informant for the fbi
whack the dalai lama
stop me and tell the world goodbye
whack the dalai lama
...
