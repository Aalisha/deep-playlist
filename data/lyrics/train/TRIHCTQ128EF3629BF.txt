Realise, iron horse will take you there,
Realise, every wall and in your head.
Take your time to look in eyes and look at yourself,
Realise to take the ball and in your land.

God damn wont you spill yourself babe, the land, all
in your hand.
All right, see yourself babe, the light, the balls on
your line.
