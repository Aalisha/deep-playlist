Remember me bastard for my years in the ice 

Do you see me your victim of old 
I have waited for revenge to turn cold 
I have explored the world to find the place you hide 
Rooted out of your rathole this is your last ride 
Red for Fire + Black for Death 

The dark horns of vengeance are about to be blown 
In retribution reborn from the forests unknown 
...
