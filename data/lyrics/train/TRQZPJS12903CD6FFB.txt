Just sit down in the back row
If you wanna play in my game.
Guess you won't have to worry
'cause all films look the same.
Just put your arms around me
And I'll make you sing out of tune.
Won't nobody watch you
'cause we're lovers in the same room.

Oh wah
a one
two
three

Put your sweet lips closer to me.
This is not F One two three
And this is n8t back row anymore.
I can't get enough of you

Can't get enough love
