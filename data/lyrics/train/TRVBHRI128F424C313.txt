Hey I see you work like a charm
I didn't mean to fall in your lap or cause alarm
but I'm on shaky ground when you get close
I got my eye on you cause baby you're the most

It's what I wanted to feel your heart
Let's dance before the stampede starts
Kiss me and we'll get out of the way
I'll be lovin' you no matter what they say

I feel the same way, so don't stop lookin' at me
I feel the same way, I hope you like what you see
I feel the same way, let's reinvent the wheel
I feel the same way, how a woman should feel
