Baby, come sit down beside me
I wanna hear all about your day
There was a pile up on the interstate
I'm sorry that I got home so late
I thought about you all the way home
Can we leave the TV off tonight, unplug the phone?

I just want to love you
More than anything else
More than life itself
More than ever, baby

I just want to hold you
Feel your breath on my skin
Again and again and again
