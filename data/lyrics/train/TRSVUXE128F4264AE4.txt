Smooth talking ladies' man
The time is come for me to tell you who and what I am
I ignored the danger sign
I held on to you tight
Just like the grapes cling to the vine

I was only seventeen
A virgin to your love
A stranger to your dreams
You talked about sincerity
You wanted most to turn me out exclusively

And baby baby I was like a child
And then you tried to drive me wild
Baby you never had time for me

I'm gonna call you Mr. Icecream cuz you're just too cold
I'm gonna call you Mr. Icecream cuz you're just too cold
