We bring a sacrifice unto the Savior
Broken and contrite in spirit and truth
Our hands applauding You
Our voice declaring You
Our souls will leap and our feet dance for You

So...

Sing of His goodness
And sing of His mercy
And sing of His kindness
We worship free...
Sing of His power
And sing of His glory
And sing of His majesty, for He is King
Sing! Oh, oh sing!

Our hearts we lay down
Our minds renewed and sound
Every knee shall bow down unto Thee
Hallelujah we sing
...
