(Coverdale/Marsden)

When I heard the sound of thunder
On the day that I was born,
I was blinded by the lighting
An' baptised in the storm
My father started crying
When he saw what he had done,
But, my mother started praying
Have mercy on my son,
He is a child of Babylon

I am a child of Babylon,
Lord have mercy on a wayward son
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
I am a child,
A child of Babylon
