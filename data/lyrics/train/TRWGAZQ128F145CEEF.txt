Verse 1

If you see a pretty lady walking down the street
Will you remember…me?
When a woman comes up to you looking good, talkin' bout what she gonna do
Will you remember me?
Will you be tempted to compromise what we have
Or will you wanna make it last?
If you're tempted to jeopardize our relationship
Will you remember this…

Chorus

Remember
Remember
Remember me?
Will you remember
Remember
Ooh, ooh remember me?
