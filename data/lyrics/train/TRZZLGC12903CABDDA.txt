You keep catching my eye
And we keep looking at each other
Is this what it feels like
To be someone's lover
There was never a time
And the clock didn't matter 'til now
And we could say that it's going well
It feels like Hell
Cause we walk and we talk
And we're just like the others
We touch and we move
Buried treasure discovered
And we've got no excuses at all
Cause we're just like lovers
This feels like I'm drowning
In some desert of misery
My heart lights up when I look at you
You're the only thing I can see
And we could say that it's going well
...
