Wanting meaning, wanting more than the same things
Wanting everything, just to start at the ending
I found another face to show
Just because what you say is what will go

Doubt, in it all for me
I've hit the wall, all that's left for you is doubt
Better you than me, I've so far to fall
All that's left for you is doubt
