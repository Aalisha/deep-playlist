[Jamie Madrox]
I'm Lost in my head and no one can find me.
I'm evils supreme, devil get behind me.
Cause you're takin' a walk on the dark side of your heart.
(DARKNESS AND PAIN)
But you knew it was cursed, it was fucked up from the start.

[Chorus]
Singin, Woe Woe Woe Woe.
I'm losin' control of my head and I feel that its gonna get crazy in here
(No no no no) don't say you cant feel it its time to get crazy, I'm losing my head up in here
(Tell me if you) see it feel it believe it
(Just like I do) feel it see it Believe it.

[Monoxide Child]
When you stumble when you try, and you just cant get things right.
Turn the music up and lets get fucked up its the soundtrack to my life.[x2]

[Chorus]
Singin, Woe Woe Woe Woe.
I'm losin' control of my head and I feel that its gonna get crazy in here
