Special request to Matilda, ay
A you fi checkout mi bredda, ay
A uno memba Matilda, sweet sweet Matilda
Jamaica, look pon sweet sweet Matilda
It was me and Matilda down inna the schoolyard
Diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum
It was me and Matilda down inna the schoolyard
Diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum
Me say she turn superstar, say she gone abroad
She never memba nobody down a yard
Me and Matilda down inna the schoolyard
Diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum
It was me and Matilda down inna the schoolyard
Diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum, diddle dee dum
An' if you see Matilda she's a one likkle queen
We used to sit together and eat ice cream
See Matilda she's a one likkle queen
