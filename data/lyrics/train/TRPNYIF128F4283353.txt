(John Farrar)

I got chills
They're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying!

You better shape up
'Cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up
You better understand
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left
Nothing left for me to do

You're the one that I want
Oo-oo-oo honey
The one that I want
Oo-oo-oo honey
