I met a man in New Orleans wore a half suit with dark blue jeans
Kicked his heals together winked at me real nice.
I saw him from a mile away,
But in my state of mind I let him make his play
"Hey boy... have you seen the other side"
Yeah... in this man I saw the devil's hand so I looked at him man to man said
"This time it's gonna be a fight!"

I do not have to justify,
The way I live my life.
I do not have to justify,
The reason I'm alive.

I saw her from across the room with diamond eyes she's heaven's jewel.
Dropped two aces smiled and threw my cards back.
Yeah I've been that man
Who lives deceit
