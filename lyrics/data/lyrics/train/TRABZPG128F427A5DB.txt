"(yeah) Hey, what do you say
If I've got you it's a brand new day
Ain't nothing gonna bring me down

We stick together like crazy glue
As long as you've got me, baby I've got you
There's no stopping us now

When it's dark, when it's cold
When you're scared and alone
I'll be there, by your side
And that's all you need to know

These are the reasons that we love
And baby, my love you can be sure of
I got your back, when the odds are stacked
Against us you will see
This is a promise that I make
...
