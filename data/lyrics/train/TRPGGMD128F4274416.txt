She's always funny in the morning
She isn't always funny in the night
Once she gets a couple drinks in, she's probably gonna tell you you ain't doing anything right
Then you'll roll your eyes and then you'll probably fight

She mainly trades in adoration
She gets pretty wasted at the celebrations
The benefits and the building dedications

It's always sunny in the morning
It sucks around the ending of the night
When she storms out of the restaurant
I think you're supposed to chase her to the lights
