When should I pick a new substance?
Learned to live with nothing at all
My times spent on limiting
Prayer wasted on unwanted gods
Lead the lemmings, base it on constants
Who will jump when it's time to fall?
When god came nothing was decided
No right to think, no wrong to feel

Take a look, clarify contents
One word makes a difference
Repeat carbon copy cutouts
Looking up when you should look down
Take a second dignity compounds
With the slightest hammer fall
