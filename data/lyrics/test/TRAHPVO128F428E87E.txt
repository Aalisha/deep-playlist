Gone, missing all the lost and lonely eyes
Well, isn't that to come as no surprise?
Well it came to me
Sunlight
Begging me to leave this room and grow
And the carpet
Leading us to god knows who might know
It waits for you
And it waits for me too

That's just the way it goes
Stars won't tell me how I move
...
