In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town

Down in the Delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton till my fingers hurt
Draggin' the sack through that Delta dirt

And I've worked hard the whole week long
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
There ain't a lot of money in a cotton bale
