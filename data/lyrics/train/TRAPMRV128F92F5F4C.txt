Hole in my head
hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
Let's just say we will and then don't instead

Wild goose chase
Wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You're gonna take me boy on a wild goose chase
You better find somebody to take my place

You took my imagination and stomped it inthe ground
Now I can only think about you
chasin' the tracks that you left around

Hole in my head
hole in my head
Oh I need a boy like you like a hole in my head
