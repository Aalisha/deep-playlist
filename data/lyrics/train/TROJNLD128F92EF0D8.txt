You were all alone
You were constantly broken
You felt so unloved
You were left abandoned
What a difference love can make
To the deep heartbreak back then

(Chorus)
This is now
This is hope
This is the end of a longing
The beginning of a road
To a change
Where everything around you no longer falling down
...
