Woke up this morning with my heart on fire
held on to what I'd been dreaming
woke up this morning, I had one desire
to get back to what I'd been seeing

Heaven
it was heaven
I have never known a bliss
witnessed anything like this

Glowing all over as I started on my feet
thought I heard somebody calling

Heaven
it was heaven
now I know I've seen the light
make it go on shining

I keep on searching for the way to your heart
try to believe it's getting better
baby, take me all the way to your heart
...
