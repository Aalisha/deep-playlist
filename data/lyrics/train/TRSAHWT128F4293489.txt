I'm gonna hold on to you as long as I can.
I'm gonna hold on to you as long as I can.
And if you choose to leave me, girl, I'll understand
I'm gonna hold on to you as long as I can.

Just like the Mississippi
Our journey starts in Minnesota
Take I-35 to 90:
Sioux Falls, South Dakota

Big "Hi," to that country road.
Are we gonna make it on down?
She said, "Yeah, Tim.
Aw, Good to see ya.
Hope you all stay around."

The future's not the hardest to see.
Do what you do girl,
but please don't leave.

I'm gonna hold on to you as long as I can.
