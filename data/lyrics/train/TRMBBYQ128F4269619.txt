In the beginning all is beautiful and perfect like in paradise
But can you feel the ticking of the time bomb lying by your side?
By your side

Like a dying star
Fading in the light
Like a dying star
Nothing left of you

You know what you mean to me, but you can never stop to do me harm
Love turns into hate, distorted feelings all around
All around
