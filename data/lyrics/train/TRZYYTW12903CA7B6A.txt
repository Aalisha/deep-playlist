Gonna get up, gonna get up, gonna get up, oh, oh
Gonna get up, gonna get up, gonna get up, ooho, ooho
And time won't take my love away

Ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho

You're such a, you're such a
You're such a, you're such a
Hot temptation
You just walk right in
Walk, walk, walk right in and

Ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho
Ooho, ooho, ooho, ooho

Gonna get up, gonna get up, gonna get up
...
