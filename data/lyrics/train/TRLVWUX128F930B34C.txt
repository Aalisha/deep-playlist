I never got my license to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck -
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
...
