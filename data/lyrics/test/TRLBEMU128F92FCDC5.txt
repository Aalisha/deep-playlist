She said "I'm going out with my girlfriends.
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn".
Oh have mercy... my only thought,
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off.

I told her put an extra layer on!
I know what happens when she drinks Patr√≥n.
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off.

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes.
Lose an earring in her drink.
