Here we are in the west
And our cars are glistenin'
The bear he roars in the east
But we ain't listenin'
We won't play games in his backyard
But we let him build his wall
We say our God is on our side
Hope he's listenin' to us all

While we talk

He's gettin' dresses, he's lookin' for his thrills
He's gettin' dresses to kill

We got eyes in the stars
But we don't care what they see
We put a man on the moon
