Living life now from my bed
These four walls are my best friends
Broken bottles broken heart
The time has come death do us apart

Conversation isn't always right
When you're talking from both sides
Sometimes I see things that aren't really there
So come on over if you dare

Screaming at myself there ain't nobody else that's the end
There ain't nobody listening all the walls are closing in

No one has come around today
Outside world's gone away
Stuck inside this hurtin place
...
