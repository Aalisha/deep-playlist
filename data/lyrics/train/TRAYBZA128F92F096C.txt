Ah, ah, ah, oh yeah !
I'm lost, since you've been gone
Ah, ah, ah, oh yeah !
I'm lost, since you've been gone


How can I change the way you feel
Tell me any real
Since you've been gone, I'm lost
How can I make you understand that I can't live without your love
Since you've been gone, I'm lost

Since you've been gone, I'm lost
