Holding back the feelings I have for you
Forbidden to tell you what I think
The poison they call lust is running through my veins
It's driving me insane
It hurts each and everyday
Tell me what to do or say
To have you in my arms
By my side
Out of just my mind and in my life
Oh god what I would give to have you be mine

When's it gonna be my time?
