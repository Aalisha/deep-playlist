Yes it's real gone
Hand you my lovin', you know what I mean
Feels so bad I built a lovin' machine
Up to my house, I'll show you what I mean
Well I just got wise and built me a lovin' machine

Well you put a nickel in the slot
You hear sounds buzzin'
Kisses wild and hot
Five cents a dozen

Up to my house, I've got something you've never seen
Well I got hip to the tip and built me a lovin' machine
