I know what it takes
To break you
And then sweep the proof away
You know there is no escape

The hunter and the pray
Become one whenever we embrace
Love is the strangest place
Wherever you hide
I will find and capture you
You won't sleep tonight
Cuz I am wide awake
What I want I take so

Stop don't talk
I have decided
Girls on top
Don't try to fight it
Won't give up not till you try it
It's my turn tonight
We're like
Fire and water
One might
Burns out the other
You can't stop
...
