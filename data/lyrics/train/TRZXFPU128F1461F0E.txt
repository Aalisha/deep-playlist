(By Leslie Satcher & Tim Ryan Rouillier




I ain't in love, I ain't your bud
I ain't your little turtle dove
I ain't your chick, I ain't your squeeze
I ain't the girl I used to be
But baby, you still shake me
I ain't upset, I ain't a wreck
Cause I forgive and I forget
And I ain't bitter, I ain't sore
...
