I've followed traces of the steps before
I've passed away now, into peaceful war
Nearing now I see I have longed to be
Taken by the hand of the faceless one who stands
Now I undergo the change of life foretold
Growing on to me and now I soon shall be

Soaring blindly in a race through borrowed time
And beside me a race of souls who ride
...
