So here it is
F**k it
Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit
To last me clear to the ends of my term
I hate worms
So i'ma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand
To refrain from my fist
Yeah I wish that I change
Then I could shed all the (main)
You trippin' on my ego
But all my shit is sustained
Order order
I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself
Bitch I could chill as a bum ho hum
Drum
I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my fears on my nerves
And the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my (back) is me
In reality, see
I'm constantly fightin heavy
When we journey through the sea
Oui oui monsieur
I'm true to the game
I believe my friends you (slip) me
I might have the ego but you'll tell me who're trippin'
I know
And it shows
I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're effected by the e-g-o

On the downlow
(x3)

I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth
Clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that i'ma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before, and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty
My mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you
Or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep
I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom
With cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me
