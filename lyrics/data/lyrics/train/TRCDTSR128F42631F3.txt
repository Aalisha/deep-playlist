You've taken the last of me
The god's of your innocence shall not protect you from the hate of my wrath
You've taken the last of me
Blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes

The blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret
The shadow of justice now engulfs you
As cold hands reap the pain they've sewn
You've taken the last of me
Blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes

The blood will drown in red and I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret
