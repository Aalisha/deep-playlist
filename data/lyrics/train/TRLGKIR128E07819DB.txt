Adams Ryan
Gold
Gonna Make You Love Me
Riot on the streets, the touch beneath the sheets
It's only gonna make me love you more
The cops they got the guns, the night destroys the sun
It's only gonna make me love you more

This old world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
