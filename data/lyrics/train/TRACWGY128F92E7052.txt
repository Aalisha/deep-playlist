Save yourself.
Because the only thing that matters
is that you get away from the pain
and the thought of losing your mind.
Don't blame yourself.
It was everyone around you who made you act this way.
There's the stage and your chance to watch it go down.
Don't fake yourself into ever, ever thinking about yesterday.
That was then, this is now. Don't call it undone.
Don't take what you've been dealt.
