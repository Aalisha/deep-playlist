She's like the wind, through my tree
She rides the night, next to me
She leads me through moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
She's taken my heart
She doesn't know what she's done

Feel her breath on my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league
Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind
