We're gonna wake this city tonight
Oh, watch it burn into the twilight
I said hey, hey, hey this is our birthright
To be bought and sold, shipped off ready to die, we're ready to fight

We're going bom bom bom
Bom bom away bom bom bom bom bom
We go bom bom, bom bom away bom
Bom bom, bom bom

I can't drink or drive a tank at nineteen
So I set off to join the U.S. Army
The first time I left my country
I felt the desert sand marchin' under my feet, come march with me
