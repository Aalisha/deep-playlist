Mama, oh mama, I don't wanna come down
Not if it's all like it was on the ground
Hiding my feet 'cause I'm too shy to dance
Hiding my face behind both of my hands

Mama, oh mama, don't make me come down
'cause I don't know what will come out of my mouth
People will hear they won't know who I am
People will hear and they won't understand

Mama, I've seen them, the others like me
Once I could see it was all I could see
The silent procession that crosses the snow
...
