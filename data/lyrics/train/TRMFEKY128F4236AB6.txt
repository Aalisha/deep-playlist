[Benzino]:
In the studio all night makin' hits
Since you claim I don't right I'm a put it like this
Benzino shit tight when I flex my wrists
Check the publishing dawg I gets checks for this
And the public gonna love with the check for this
Motivated by the hate you better check the list
Shit's climbin' homeboy you better check these whips
Fully loaded with a tech two extra clips
Now it wasn't really that long ago
When I put it down with my team almighty R.S.O.
Hustler by night make beats in the day
Had that thing under the bed if you fuck with Ray
Damn shame why we gotta live this way
Protect my life by any means I ain't dyin' today
And I love rap music it's the reason I'm alive
And my faith in God is the reason I survive what

[Chorus]:
I'm prayin' forever
I gotta find another way up
Ain't no way I'll ever give up
