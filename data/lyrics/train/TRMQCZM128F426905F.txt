Oh look, oh look, the sky is falling down
there's a sunset in the afternoon
today nuclear whispers, atomic screams now fill the night
i look outside, there's nobody home anymore, anywhere, anymore
Mass destruction, what's it all for
no one will know who won the war
everyone's dead, blown to pieces
...
