I've got two boxes paved with rockets
Where all my best friends sit
When they smile, I take their jackets
And give them a spin

We'll be 45 forever, and we'll all be scratched and cold
But at least we'll have each other
Some black, some plaqued with gold

And I won't sit here waiting
While the world spins by
My best friends are all wax now
I keep them on my side
...
