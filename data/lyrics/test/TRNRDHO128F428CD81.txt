Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Last night we made love, you called my name
And the next morning things weren't the same
Even though you stole my pride, I just can't understand why?
My heart and my mind and my soul still loves you

And I wanna hear you say that you love me
I wanna hear you say you care for me
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be

And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I got to know
Will you be there for me?
Like the way it's supposed to be

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this don't feel right
How could you break my heart and leave this good woman?
See I can't stand the pain after all the love I gave
You took it, smiled and walked away oh baby

Three days passed and there were no phone calls
I was starting to get this feeling you weren't feeling me at all
