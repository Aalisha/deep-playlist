Down around the corner, half a mile from here
See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear
Without love, where would you be now

You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back
Without love, where would you be right now
Without love-ove-ove-ove
