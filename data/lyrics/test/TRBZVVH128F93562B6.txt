You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

HAZEL:
C'mon
Let's go

You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

You're with your girl
I'm with my man
But can we be
More than friends

HAZEL:
Here we go
What's really good out there
Come on Razor
It's your girl Hazel doin' it for you

In the club shakin' shakin' it
Hey fellas watch how I'm takin' it
Up and down, females they hatin'
They boyfriends act rocksteady while
I'm dancin', I got my eyes closed
Wishin' you were the one holdin' on my thighs, 'cause
I just need a minute
To get away from my man
And when the song's finished
I'll have the number in my hand
...
