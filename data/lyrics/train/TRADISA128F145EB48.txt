As the night moves on, the days go by I am counting.
Anxiously awaiting the perfect arrival of you.
Wonder how I'm gonna feel when I first look in you eyes.
With the beauty of love in my life with one look come true
Said ooh oh yeah.

It's a Love Thing.
A Love Thing, A Love Thing.
Written in my heart and love of my Soul.
It's a Love Thing.
A Love Thing, A Love Thing.
Said ooh oh yeah
