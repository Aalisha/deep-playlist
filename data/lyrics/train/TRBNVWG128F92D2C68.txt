I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
You'll be the King of my love
I'll deal through that whole deck to find you
And You'll wait for my time to come.
I've lived a lone life dear without you
I played a lone hand all the way;
I ached when I lost, I pretended to laugh;
But I felt more like crying these days.
Since you come and stood there beside me
And told me my best way to play
Your hand touched mine and the sunshine did shine
And we left that whole card house next day.
I'll be the Queen of your heart, Dear
