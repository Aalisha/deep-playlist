She's insisting that I'm her sister
She's insisting that I fix her up
If not with money or drugs then with anything I got
Not because she wants it, just because so what

She's insisting that I'm her sister
She's insisting that I fix her up
If not with honey or love than with anything I got
Not because she wants it just because so what

Everytime I see her she says the same thing
I want in, I thought you said you'd bring me in
I thought you said you'd start with one
Start with me for free
I thought you'd start with me

Everytime I see her she says the same thing
I want in, I thought you said you'd bring me in
I thought you said you'd start with one
Start with me for free
I thought you'd start with me

She's insisting that I'm her sister,
She's insisting that I fix her up
