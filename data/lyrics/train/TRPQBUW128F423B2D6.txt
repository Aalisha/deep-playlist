Pardon my friend, he's not from here
He's got a knack for speaking with his hands
Got a short fuse, like a time bomb set to explode
I hope you understand we're even now
So just get on with your life
So take a bow
Cause you know that I will never be the same

Well, your cover has been blown
Gonna teach you that you reap what you sow
Gonna take you for everything you own
While your girlfriend's slipping in through the back door

And if you mess with me
Then you will have to answer to my friends
Just a warning for the masses
Not that hard to comprehend

Fight for what you believe in
