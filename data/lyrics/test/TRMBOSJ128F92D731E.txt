He said, "My name is Gabrielle Thomas
I just blew in from out of town
My work keeps me on the road
But it's the best job that I've found
I don't mind the silence
Or the Super 8 Motel
And I've never met a person yet
Without a tale to tell"

He said, “I know you I heard you say
'Jen, true love has no pride'
You gave Angela and Joe a lift
That night they didn't have a ride
Across the room Elaine has
Drawn your face a hundred times
I don't believe blood alone
The only tie that binds”

Sit right here rest your bones
