I remember a math teacher I had in 7th grade,
he talked down to me about every single day.
And to make the matters worse, the bastard failed me too
so for the first time in my life I raised my fist and said "Fuck you".
That was the me that I thought that I was going to become.
I made no mistakes and I made sure everything got done
by me and no one else but now I just let others decide.
I've become so indolent should I just go run and hide.
How come every song I write has some ska breakdown.
And why do I care if my styles change?
How come it feels like everybody is talking about me behind my back again like my old friends?
