No more going to the dark side
With your flying saucer eyes
No more falling down a wormhole
That I have to pull you out

The wriggling twiggling worm inside
Devours from the inside out
No more talk about the old days
It's time for something great

Want you to get up
And make it work

So many allies, so many allies
...
