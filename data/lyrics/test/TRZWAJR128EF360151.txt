[Akir:]
Yeah, uhh
It's yours truly Akir, one of the prizes
Southpaw whattup~!
We takin over this year man
Mood Music, yo, yo

Aiyyo my music for the moodiest sidewalks
I talk ebonics, smoke chronic, and drink {? }
Until I feel bionic off the hydroponic
Some niggaz never mastered phonics foolish states for how they act around us
Some people ask about us, I never try to be somethin that ain't me
Never plan to be Tupac, Biggie or Jay-Z
Even though they lives are amazing
To share they occupation never want the fans all dazed and
If I was shoppin at, Macy's, want to have a wife and babies
Supportin 'em from endeavors that consistantly pay me
Real estate investments and a big Mercedes maybe
Somethin, a little shady, not too Johnny-Come-Lately saved me
As I come in when I breeze you as you can't rotate me
Or a autographed picture of a mixtape ease
Into things only to show and prove for kings of rings
When I get I handle my business live it like a king
So bling bling ain't a thing to be braggin
Niggaz with things steam for a chance at your baggage
Not to be cling cling to a cop that he raggin
Or locked in Sing-Sing for somethin that just happened
I'd rather hold you captive like a pirate ship captain
Plus a nice package so I'm goin ghetto platinum
Niggaz know I'm stackin but I'm passin out ratchets
Tryin to span the classes like elastic with my classics
