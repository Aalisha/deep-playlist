God, didn't give up on me
Didn't give up on me
God, didn't give up on me
Didn't give up on me

When I'm weak God
Well, He didn't let me go, yeah
When I messed up
He restored my soul
Oh, it was God
Ooh, that didn't give up

Read in the paper the other day
About a preacher who feel from grace
He begged the church for forgiveness
He realized he made a mistake

And some folks left the church and said
He's suppose to be a man of the cloth
See they forgot He was the same man
That prayed for them when they were lost

So glad God is not like man
He won't throw you away
After you've done wrong
God will pick you up and dust you off
