Every day... I tell myself, it's temporary
That it's only 'cause she's young
That makes her want... another man

Eventhough she makes me feel un-necessary
I've found a way to help me understand

I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been
Who you've been with
What you've done

And it's a lonely thing
...
