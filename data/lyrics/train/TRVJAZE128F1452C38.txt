Welcome to the great republic
Guess I should show you round
Where once I was a King, and now I am a clown

The love that we once shared, made a King of me
But now you're gone, but now you're gone
All I face is poverty

King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown

Hell hath no fury (Hell hath no fury)
Like a woman scorned (Like a woman scorned)
But heaven don't boast, no heaven don't boast
The jewel, the pretty jewel I just pawned (I just pawned)
