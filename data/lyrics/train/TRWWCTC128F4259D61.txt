Sail lightly on winds
Disappear on the breeze
Lie firmly on pins
Pull them out with ease

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most intricate locks
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Skeleton key
Ha ha ha
Skeleton key
Ha ha ha

Fumble blindly as we speak
You will wither if you are weak
Finger turns and points at me
I'd hoped they wouldn't notice me

Solid boned skeleton key
Opens the most intricate locks
Brother roll another for me
I am shipwrecked on the rocks

Skeleton key
Skeleton key
Skeleton key
Skeleton key
