Risin' up
Back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance
Now i'm back on my feet
Just a man and and his will to survive
So many times
It happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin us all with the eye
...
