Aghast amidst the grim procession
Of hateful traits in your possession
And there's nowhere to hide when the waves come crashing in
And there's nowhere to hide when the waves come crashing in

The silence hums behind your eyes
A veil that shields you from your lies
But when the truth rains down, it'll drown you like a flood
But when the truth rains down, it'll drown you like a flood
