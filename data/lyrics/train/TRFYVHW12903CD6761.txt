From 12 stories high I watch the smoke against the sky
And the daytime turns into dark
Now, who would've thought - after all that kerosene I bought -
That it would only take one flaming arrow to hit the mark
Now I just watch your building on fire
I hate to say I told you so, but
You build me up and you burn me down
So I take the trick you play and turn it around
You build me up and you burn me down
And you know I love to watch you rolling on the ground
