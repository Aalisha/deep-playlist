I've been keeping track of everything
Notes and maps of where I've been
Somehow I've always found
I way to sleep through unfamiliar sounds
I lost myself in FM airwaves
And found a way to keep my mind straight
I'm living well, at least in my head
And letting go of what you said

Everybody come a little bit closer
Everybody sing a little bit louder
We run this town tonight

So keep your fingers crossed
Hide them behind your back
I'll hold my breath
And let you fill the room
With smoke and mirrors things look clearer
Just don't panic
So chase your words with your tongue
'Cause you can't avoid me now

I lost track of the little things
