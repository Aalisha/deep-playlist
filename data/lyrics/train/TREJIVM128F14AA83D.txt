You, baby baby you
you are my sunshine
dubi dubi du ahhh
and you make my dreams come true
you are my sunshine
(sunshine)
Friday night at the dance ho boogie
listen to the music waste my time
(Oh yeah)
Suddenly you came of to me
And you smile and sad: it's time today
(oh yeah)
I just ... it was my turn
You, baby baby you
you are my sunshine
dubi dubi du ahhh
and you make my dreams come true
you are my sunshine
(sunshine)
You, baby baby you
...
