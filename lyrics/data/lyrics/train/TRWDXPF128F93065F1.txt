I'm up each day with the risin' sun
I've got a job and it must be done
I leave for work feelin' good,
'Cause you're on my mind
Each part of you help me pass the time
I'm a poor man's son

Push, push, and on workin' with a smile
Just lovin' you makes it all worthwhile
I'll get my pay like the rest
...
