It's not easy being green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it may be nicer being red, or yellow or gold
Or something much more colorful like that

It's not that easy being green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're
Not standing out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky
...
