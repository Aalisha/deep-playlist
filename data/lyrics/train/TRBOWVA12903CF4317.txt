To see is to bleed
a true divine
but to mislead is to feed a mind
and if the bread they sell is baked
it's what those who are starved will always take

and all within that small guild know
the bread we eat is the bread they show
the more we eat the less minds grow
where wheat can be white if they say so

what i see is how they lock us in
we need to break these chains free
what we need now is some action
