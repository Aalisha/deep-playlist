Oh yeah,
Whoa no.

She passed out at my parents' dinner (you gotta love her).
She screamed at my Dad that I'm a winner ("He's a winner!") (she really digs me).
She's scared the house might fall on us (while we're sleeping).
She's scared that we are going nuts (that's what I'm thinking).

Whoa yeah.
Whoa, whoa yeah.

She takes pot to come down,
Yeah coke for the confidence.
All kinds of pills if she had the money she would get 'em.
Huffing for a challenge,
Acid for the love of it.
And, and, and, and, and drinking just for fun.

My girlfriend's on drugs.
