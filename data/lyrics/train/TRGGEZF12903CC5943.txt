I look back, so much time
What once was, now it's gone
Now it's fine, now it's fine

I had to leave myself
To find out who I am
And to build a new self, a new self

I look back, so far back
And I know it's all gone
I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I have found a new life
There's a line in my past
Cuts it off like a knife, like a knife

I will kill the machine
Because it has to be done
Get over what I have been
And then never need to run

I will realize my dream
With all the blood in my veins
To fight the machine
Until none of it remains

And everything
Somehow led me to a fresh new start
So little and so much to cure
My pain and to redefine who I am
...
