Gaze at the leaving clairvoyant
Predicting invasions and pain
A child can see through the stranger
The Watcher's eye, the noble liar

It's time for the merchant and his help for sale
Blades to cut wicked flesh
On a merchantman he counts his money then he sails away
The sea he'll cruise his blood and fire

Oh father I can't see a lane
They make you a pawn in the game for
We are all deaf, dumb and blind

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Pawn in the game, invisible chains
Try to move, you'll feel as they graze

After the storm when the magic has gone
Drown in the tears of a mandrake
Fading away, the final decay
Try to move, break out from your chains
