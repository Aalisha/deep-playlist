There'll never be no peace,
Down here, in Babylon.
Till all my brothers here,
Down here, are free.
We no want to be no peace,
Down here, in our neighbours land.
So all we want is to be free,
Like the birds and the be.

Then we can call you brothers,
Brothers, we Will be.
We can break bread together,
The way Jah wants us to be.
We can drink and honey
No wine we need this time.
Then you can be my honey
Your dandy won't mind.
