(Don Cook/Kix Brooks/Ronnie Dunn)

There's not a heart that ain't been broken
A lie that ain't been spoken
A shattered dream that brand new love can't fix
I've been burned, I've been cheated
But this old heart's still beating
Ain't no big deal

Let's dance a little closer
I'll help you get over
The hurt you thought you never could forget
