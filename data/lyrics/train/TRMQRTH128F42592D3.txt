I see everybody around but it feels like we're in private
I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it
Them lights are moving to the rhythm of the music
When we're together everything just comes together baby
So by the moment we can lose it
I hope you're ready

As long as I see the strobe lights in dancing all night long
When we're together baby
I'm feeling alright you got me all night long
So tell the dj play it
