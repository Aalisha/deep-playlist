Scorched earth lies behind them
On schedule they are
Accompanied by victory
They came from very far
Drunken of the lootings
Ares on their side
Guides them to disaster
About to turn the tide

Autumn at the Eastern Front
Still they do proceed
Heavy rains are setting in
The attack is loosing speed

Eight miles left to Moscow
Her suburbs now in sight
The 3rd and 4h Panzerarmies
Vainly wait for their supplies
Plod on through the filth
On impassible roads
Hardly making progress
Streets turn in to floads

Winter at the Eastern Front
