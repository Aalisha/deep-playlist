See every time we get together, man
It's what you call, one of those things, yeah
Young Goldie, AD, if you ain't tryna let her go
You better let her know, B street

You know they jockin', but I don't
Really give a damn what they's in for
'Cause what we had, was special
And enough to make me never wanna leave home

Maybe you're right and I'm wrong
I was too young 'n' dumb to notice
I know it looks bad but we don't
Have to deal with our problems alone

Now that I'm here, so would you stop cryin'?
Have no fear 'cause I'ma start tryin'
Girl, it's so clear, without you I'm dyin'
No, I can't let it end, so girl, I'm checkin' in

Can somebody call the doctor?
Shawty tryna give me a heart attack
Can somebody call the doctor?
And prescribe me somethin'
That'll show me how to act
