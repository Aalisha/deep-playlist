Where is the laughter, where is the hopeful?
Where is that light that makes me sing?
Where is the courage, where is the faithful?
Where is that wind beneath my high wings?

I can? t get it back, my heart beat's flat
The color? s black, I don? t feel like I used to
When something? s that wrong, gotta make it right
When my day is so long, I gotta make it right

And I know that it? s got to be me that changes
And I know that it? s got to be me that makes it
'Cause I believe, I believe
