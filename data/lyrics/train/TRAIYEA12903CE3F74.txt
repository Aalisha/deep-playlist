Raise up, everybody RAISE UP!

Raise up... raise up... raise up...

Straight out of the poorhouse eating lobster for breakfast
Two new tour buses, cause my voice is infectious
Now the super models never call me a sexist
I got the new style that is leaving them breathless
I a born entertainer coming straight out of Memphis
And if Elvis was alive, even he would admit this
I am all over the world using you as a witness
Test my drive sweetie, cause my hunger's relentless
Raise up, what you wanna do? What you wanna do? What you wanna do?
C'mon, c'mon

Raise up, what you wanna do? What you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Rause up, raise up
Everybody get together take your hands and raise up.
