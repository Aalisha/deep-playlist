Come on my sweet baby, I wanna stay with you

I wanna stay with you
Just stay with you
Tonight tonight
I wanna loving you
Just loving you
Tonight tonight

Oh I love you
In my heart
And in my soul
Uh I love you
Deep in my heart
I loose control

I loose it with the smiling face
I'm winning noup, but just in case
I'm loving you
I'm loving you
And I break up this heart to do
Another sad sad story too
I'm loving you
What can I do

I wanna stay with you
Just stay with you
Tonight tonight
I wanna loving you
Just loving you
Tonight tonight
