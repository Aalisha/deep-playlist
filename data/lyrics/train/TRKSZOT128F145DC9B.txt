(Harley)
Ooh la la ooh la la

You've done it all
You've broken every code
And pulled a rebel to the floor
You've scored again
No matter what you say
Eroded metal - what a bore
Oh blue eyes blue eyes
How come you tell so many lies

Oh oh come up and see me
Make me smile
I'll do what you want
Run on wild

There's nothing left
...
