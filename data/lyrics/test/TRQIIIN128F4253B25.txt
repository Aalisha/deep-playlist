Can you see these eyes
These eyes so bright
Day and night they need you
Are awaiting you
Quiet days passed me by
Silent tears who will cry
Filled with thoughts for you
Nights are cold without you

And slowly comes my night
Quiet colours calm my eyes
And step by step I understand
It's a question of time

And wherever you are
Hiding far away or close to me
...
