Our candle burns away
The ashes full of lies
I gave my soul to you
You cut me from behind

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You're scared of the truth
I'm tired of the lies
cause who I am
Is where you want to be

Don't act like an angel
You're falling again
You're no superhero
I found in the end

So lie to me once again
and tell me everything will be alright
lie to me once again
and ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end?

You said you were there for me
