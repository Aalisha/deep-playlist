Everybody's doing a brand new dance now
(come on baby do the locomotion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(come on baby do the locomotion)

My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier to learn than your ABC's
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby
Jump up

Jump back
