Shattered visions in yo mind or just make believe,
It's not enough 2 make me want 2 go,
Have u done your time or is it a need 2 b free,
The state of r condition's running cold,
U left me standing in a lonely world, a child without a home,
Cold abandoned in this lonely world with nothin' left 2
Believe,
Well i'm so lonely, desolate incomplete, i'm lonely,
