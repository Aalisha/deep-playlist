A B, A B C D

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

A strawberry mind, a body that's built 4 2
A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
