Take it from the top with nothin but the hot shit
I told 'em we got shit and it smells (definitely)
Mario, what's the verdict?
Hey yo, Mr. Cheeks, I know ya heard it
The way we move (make it happen), spaz out on who?
Boo c'mon, that's how we do it
This one's for you, c'mon

I did it like the Elements and wrote a song for ya
No kiddin, where my fillins gettin strong for ya
And if I really had a chance I'ma pick you
You got plans and finesse, you dress sick too
I'ma holla at you everytime ya pass by
And if I don't get you now this ain't the last try
You play hard to get, I like steppin up ma
Like bend over, yeah we both got enough time
And yousa don, so take this where ya go
Anywhere you at you'll always hear the call
In ya ear, in ya heart, until I gets through
And that's my word, I'm not stoppin till I get you
I know your pretty ass for years but don't know ya know ya
We get Manola and I feel like I got some things to show ya
I've done traveled through the world
Balled out at clubs and coughed hurl
Got weed, now I need me a girl

(Mario Winans)
I've got a crush on you, my baby
