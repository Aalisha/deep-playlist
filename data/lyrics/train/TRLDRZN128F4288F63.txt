Callin', callin', callin', callin', callin'
Warnin', warnin', warnin', warnin', warnin'

Ay, we propose to live up our life
We propose to do what is right
We propose to free our people
We propose to live in Africa

Sing it

This mess, yes, we detest
Controlled by another hand
And they're [Incomprehensible], they're just puppets
Them thing's just a puppet show

We propose all people be free
We propose equality for you and me
We propose politicians know this
Yeah, we propose u-u-united

So you better, you confess to your wickedness
I said the people already know
And protest is not enough
