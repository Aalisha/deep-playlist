un ah x4
Verse 1:
I don't know why the world loves a fallen love affair(I'm just a freak)
Who Loves a one night bang, oh yeah(A one night, all night)
After a long day of work all I want to do is play around
So I'm (going out)
For a little bit of love and a whole lot of getting down
Do you believe me? You gotta believe me

Chorus:
I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need Some, I need some love tonight ooh oh yeah
