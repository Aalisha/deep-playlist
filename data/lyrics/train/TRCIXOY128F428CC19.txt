There's something strong that's coming from you
Oh and I'm picking up on it, baby
And the message that you're sending
I can put it on through, oh, good luck to me from you

I can tell someone's messing you around
Not treating you right and it's getting you down
Oh, I've got the cure

I wanna be your doctor
Has anything been ailing you?
Is anything been failing you?
Tell me the condition of your heart

Oh, I wanna be your doctor
Oh, I may not have to operate
Maybe I'll just vaccinate
Shoot you with some love
Until you get enough of me

Condition of the heart
Condition of the heart
