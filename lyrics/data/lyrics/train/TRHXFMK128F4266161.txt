Did you see it?
It was so easy

Did you see it?
It was so easy

It's been so long that it's all been forgotten
It's been so long that I would not know

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

Would'ja b'lieve it?
It was so easy

Don't shoot the messenger it's not his fault
It's just a drag when you're the last one to know

Four sleeping dogs lie
Four sleeping dogs lie
...
