So you've decided to blame him again for all your choices.
Seem like the softer way out.
You think you just might make life easier to swallow will it.
You made a fine career out of guilt.
Maybe he just did the best he could with what he had
Maybe he just did the best he could

Forgiveness, Forgiveness, Try and let it go why don't you
Forgiveness, Just might save yourself
Forgiveness, Forgiveness, Try and let it go why don't you
Forgiveness, Just might save yourself

So you've decided to blame him again for all your choices.
Seem like the softer way out.
You think you just might make life easier to swallow will it.
