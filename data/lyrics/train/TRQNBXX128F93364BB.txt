There's no way to please you
Baby, I know, let's call it a day
There's nothing I can say or do to
Make it up to you anyway

Honey, if you don't mind, put it off 'til tomorrow
Honey, if you don't mind, let it lie for today
Honey, if you don't mind 'cause it only brings sorrow
And we know where that's goin'
'Cause it's always the same if you don't mind

Let's go see a movie, baby
