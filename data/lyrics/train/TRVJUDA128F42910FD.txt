Shambling down the roadside
Cheering as he goes
A manic, flailing cretin
In filthy, tattered clothes
Dead things are his playmates
He takes them in his care
Clutching limbs and tails
He whips roadkill through the air

He uses them in puppet shows
Hung around his shack
Stuffs his backpack full of fur
Some bloodyÂ—most are flat
Tied onto his belt of rope
A skirt of sunbaked stink
Running out of furry friends
