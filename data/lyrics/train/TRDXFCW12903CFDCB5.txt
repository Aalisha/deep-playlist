Take a second, think of everything you've done
You're getting warmer, while your former
Blocks out the sun
Standing close to the ground, a lucky charm he found
To wish this away
Pressing deep in his palm for some kind of calm
To make things seem okay

(Chorus)
Places you should never go
And that's exactly where you've been
And people you should never know
...
