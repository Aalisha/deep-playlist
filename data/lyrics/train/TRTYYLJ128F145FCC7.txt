Underneath the waves
All the heavy sky
I will grow my wings
I will learn to fly

'Cause even though my heart is big enough to fly away
Underneath the confidence, well, I will never say
"I'm strong enough to be alone"

Do you know

Do you know, how it feels to be angry
Do you know, how it feels to be hurt
When you live all your life for a moment
Just to prove that you know what it's worth
Do you know
