I need to be someone who's a lot like you
Easy to see that I sure need something new
Though I try to live life my way
I think it goes to prove
That I need to be someone who's like you

And I know that you want to change me
Wanna rearrange the way I feel inside
And I've heard that you take
The broken hearts of lonely souls
And you make all things right

But you know who I am
Have you seen the things I've done?
Do you know who I am?
