She has no trouble with passion and compassion
Deciding everything will be fine
She has her own life, her own life, she's telling you
That's good enough
For giving, for-for-forgiving
For giving, for-for-forgiving

Now look at him
He was a handsome guy
Now he's a pretty cute guy
She says it's better he stopped being him

21st century
Venus via Mars
There is no need for the barbershop
We don't need guitars
Modern woman's modern man
They're showing us how
We're losing c-c-c-control
