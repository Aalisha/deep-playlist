Round
like a circle in a spiral
like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending on beginning
on an ever-spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain
or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
past the minutes on its face
And the world is like an apple
spinning silently in space
Like the circles that you find

In the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow
to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
...
