Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
As the village children fight each other for their share
And the Six O' Nine goes roarin' past the creek
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really doin' fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl, she needs a hand to run that farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old fashioned feelin' fully grown
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home
...
