I awoke in a room that was
Occupied by those about to die
For my sleep was disturbed
By the sound of old mens cries for help
What's this place what the hell am I doing here
What's happened to me
And I'm wondering what kind of state
My mind and body's in

Be calm please lay back
We will help you rest for a while

And I yelled "No you don't I'm not going to sleep"
