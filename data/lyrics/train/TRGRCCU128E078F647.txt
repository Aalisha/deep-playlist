I'm sorry
I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory's forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where your going anyway
