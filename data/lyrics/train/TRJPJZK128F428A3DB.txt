I suppose I could stop it now
And say I didn't need it anyhow
Just walk away and let it go
Tip my hat and try to play it cool
To keep myself from being made a fool
I could pretend you don't already know that

I'm already gone
I never thought I'd cross over the line
But it's way too late
And your love is just too strong
And I'm already gone
...
