Fortunata woman,
you know I wanted to fly,
make it by myself alone.
Now I'm lookin' for a man
with a silver dollar shoeshine,
I gotta get a way back home.

Listen to me, woman,
now can't you hear me callin',
I've got a lot of love to do.
Don't you know I'm gonna cry some,
I know I'm gonna die some,
I gotta get back to you.

Chorus
Gotta get back, gotta get back,
gotta get, gotta get back to you.
...
