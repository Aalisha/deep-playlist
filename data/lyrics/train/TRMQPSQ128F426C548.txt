I get up in the mornin
Kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes
Playin tricks with my head
I work like a dog
On a job every day
Tryin to make some money
So you can go and play

In the nightime
It's the right time
I said the night time
That's the right time
I want to be with you
In the night time

I come home from work
You know I'm tired and I'm beat
...
