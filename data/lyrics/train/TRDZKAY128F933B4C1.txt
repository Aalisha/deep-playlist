Lie down with me, my dear
Lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me anytime you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-alikes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But, Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
...
