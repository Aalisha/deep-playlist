Wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Plannin' and dreamin' each night of her charms
That won't get you into her arms

So if you're lookin' to find love, you can share
All you gotta do is
Hold her and kiss her and love her
And show her that you care-are

Show her that you care just for her
Do the things she likes to do
Wear your hair just for her
'Cau-ause, you won't get her
Thinkin' and a-prayin'
