Well, I rush out blazin'
My pulse is racin'
As the rain streams down my face

There's no turning back now
To fight with fate
Outnumbered an' out of place

They said,"Go west young man, that's best
It's there you'll feel no pain"
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave
But I want to live again

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must stop ridin' like the storm

Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight?
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone
