Just see how she makes them love her
Twisting the world around her finger
Sensing weakness in a stranger
With one kiss she'll re-arrange ya
But I know the truth behind her smile
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy
If you meet again she may pass you by
No apologies, never compromise
It's the truth behind her smile
...
