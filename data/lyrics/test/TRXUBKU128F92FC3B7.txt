I know where I'm goin'
Don't you want to come too
I got my reservations
And I got one for you
The trains leavin' just after dark
There's always room for a lovin' heart
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too

I know my destination
It's all waiting for me
I got no hesitation
That's where I want to be
And by the time that the sun comes up
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you want to come too
