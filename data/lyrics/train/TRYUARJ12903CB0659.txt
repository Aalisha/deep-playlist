Maybe this is out of line but I envy the dead sometimes.
It's hard to say cause I've had close friends that passed away.
But they never have to feel again.
They never have to be in pain.
They never have to struggled just to be denied.
Maybe I'm the one who's cursed,
Condemned to walk the Earth,
To grow old and lose my grip on everything that's close to me.
But I don't know.
I'm just thinking.
