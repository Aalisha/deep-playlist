{You got the flop for your hair
Check this out}

Let's have a party
Connect me to somebody
Let's have a party
Connect me to somebody
Five, five, five on line

Bein' the man that I am
And the click that I got
I wish I was a little bit more like Super Cop
It's a frenzy my friends be
Like Benzs to Bentley
This bad boy not bad
So why don't you comprende?
I got your number
Don't you think it's time we hook it up
I'm home alone
Ain't no mums in my area
Can't go to your place
'Cos your mum's scarier
You want to bring some of your friends
The more the merrier

You got my number on your dial
Waitin' just to come around
Anytime, anywhere
Whatever's planned of mini skirts
High shoes and leather
Tonight's the night
Do me right, turn me on

Jhelisa got the body
Julie got the back
Lisa got the energy
To help me stay on track
