[Girl:]
Doctor, I have a pain
All over my body
And oh doctor, I heard you were the best
Can you help me? Oh doctor, can you heal me?
Do you think I can be cured?
Doctor can you heal me? I hear you're the best

[Robin Thicke:]
Oh, hello...
I'm glad you can make it
Can I offer you a, cocktail? Some roses or champagne perhaps?
We have some chocolate covered strawberries, if you like
Whatever you want, whatever you need

I got you, I got you, I got you... I got you baby
I got you, and you got... me too

Well I will play, we'll always text each other
XXX, we'll always be together
