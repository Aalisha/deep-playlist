This knots easy
The very third house
See the light through
Threw out the last ouch

Much wasn't real
Amongst hierarchy fields
Sure we'll travel together
But socialites have beautiful skin

Bravo, bravo
Your fourth missed rest
Generations misled
Fantasy island remembers me
Shame for the ordinary

Global warming upon us
Inspire yourselves position up
Once in a lifetime attempting
You can trust the sun
Apples don't mean a thing
If they don't mean to me
