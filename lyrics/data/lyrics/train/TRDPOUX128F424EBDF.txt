Wrapped up in this world of anger
There's no second chance out of here
Nail tight your eyes now, honey
Because I know just what you fear

Well, I've seen it all before
And it all comes back to me
Well, I see your face now, honey
And I know just where you've been

With someone, someone well there's
Someone just like you
Oh, I need someone
To take away the blue

Someone, well there's someone just like you
