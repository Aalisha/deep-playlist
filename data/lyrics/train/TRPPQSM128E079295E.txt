Some of us play life like a board game
It's new fun and you play it with people
There's a time you get tired and you put it away
Then one day you get it out and the places are broken

Self-discipline
I want to feel before you
Take it slow
Feel before you, yeah

Where I stand, where I stand
Where I stand, that's where I stand
