And I found a new thrill... 
And I found a new... 
Bop, bop, baby, don't stop

Woah, I found a me a new thrill
I never found before
Oh, my now, I found me a new thrill
I never found before
When I show you, baby
It's gonna thrill me more

Gonna thrill me when you
Rock me, baby, once
Rock me, baby, twice
Rock me, baby, rock me
Til you melt away the ice

Do the cool shake
You do the cool shake
