It's been so long since I've seen you
And your chocolate legs wrapped around me
Your sexy smell drives me crazy
Let's get married, I'm walking down that highway

Suite lady, lady, lady, will you marry me?
Suite lady, lady, lady, will you marry me?

I never thought I would ever
Want matrimony forever
But you brought that suite deep familiar
Let's get married

Suite lady, lady, lady, will you marry me?
Suite lady, lady, lady, will you marry me?
Suite lady, lady, lady, will you marry me?
