Yeah honey, we need a solution
Or everything will end right now
We had it all, we were one, we were perfect together
I’m tired of making the decisions
Girl, I’m ready to break down
We had it all, we were one, we were certain for something

We suffer without one another
All I need is some respect and a little love
We had it all, we were one, we were second to no one
I’m ready for your explanation
This life you just can’t walk out of
