Another day, another town
Another city, it's all the same
And I used to find
Comfort in all of this
It's an excuse to
Deviate from the norm

Pathetic isn't it?
After all these years
Still not content

Happiness has been long lost
Suffering a drug with no cost
How great it would be to end it all

Another day, another town
Another city, it's all the same

Another show, another state, another country
It's always been the same to me
