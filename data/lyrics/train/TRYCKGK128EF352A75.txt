She's got curls to straighten out
He's got an answer for everything
You can see the movie that's about
But you can't really talk until you've been

See them all coming up for air
We're oh so tired with something to show
Recognize her footstep sound on the stairs
Listen up high but talk low

A car in every front lawn
More time in every clock
A girl in every doorway
A bar on every block

What we have now...
...
