Dr. seuss is dead
We await life
Dr. seuss is dead
A cloud of flies obscure the sun
A stone is dropped the dream undone
Ripples grow and ride the tide
The dead things crawl from deep inside
With it's dying
Sour breath
The burning smell of insect flesh
Hungry things in circles crowd
Around tv's turned up too loud
We are the dead next door
It's up too loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's up too loud
Taste the light inject the lord
It's up too loud
I cut myself again because I'm so fuckin' bored
It's too fuckin' loud
We are the dead next door
It's too fuckin' loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's too fuckin' loud
Taste the light inject the lord
