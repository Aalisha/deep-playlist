I thought that I wanted to be free
And the street life was the thing for me
But I was wrong

I shouldn't have let you get away
I've seen too many lonely days
Since you've been gone

I miss you, baby
My life is coming apart
I need to be with you
Wherever you are

A different carol every night
Music, wine and soft lights
Don't help at all

'Cause when I'm about to get it on
My mind drifts to the telephone
Hoping you call
...
