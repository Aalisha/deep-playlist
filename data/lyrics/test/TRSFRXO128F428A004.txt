When I passed you in the doorway
Well you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance
But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
