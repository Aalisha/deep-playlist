When you've given all you've got
and you're feeling overcome
when you're backs against the wall
there's noone left to call, call me

when you're head is so full
and you feel misunderstood
and the fear is coming fast
you think you're time has past
you say why me, why me?

if you want it
you know i've got it
...
