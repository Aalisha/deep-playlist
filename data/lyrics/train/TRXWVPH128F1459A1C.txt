Say it's all right (it's all right)
Say it's all right (it's all right)
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, whoa, it's all right

We're gonna move it slow
When lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more
And it's all right, whoa, it's all right

Now listen to the beat
Kinda pat your feet
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, whoa, it's all right
