Court the darkness like she's your lover
Girl you nailed one time and can't get over
Feverish and sleepless at night
It's only because you cannot tear your eyes from her

If love is the answer you seek
You're askin' the wrong kind of question
The wrong kind of question will keep
You askin' me, askin' me for love

And all the stars and satellites give you nothing
'Cause all the satellites died

And all the satellites in your atmosphere
They burn for you but you're cold as mars
I know you see the light in the sky like I do
...
