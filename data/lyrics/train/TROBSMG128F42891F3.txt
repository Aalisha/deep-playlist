What we have
Is something special
To you I'll give my all in lords?
My love is unconditional

Good things come to those who wait
(I know your love was worth to wait)
my life is complete now I found you oohoo
no need to search no more
I found what I'am looking for
We've got the real thing baby
In you I have no doubts
This is what it's all about
We've got the real thing baby
