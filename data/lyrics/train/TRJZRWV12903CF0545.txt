Help me off your back
I found it's so futile to attack
So what else you got
You won't tell the truth until you're caught

I'll be in your room, you'll be comin' soon
I'll be gone all day grab it that's your way

I wish I could pretend
But you'll fire one off at me again
Revenge me, now don't it seem like
You're a little sweet
