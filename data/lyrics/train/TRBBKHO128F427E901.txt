After the dance I walked my baby home under the moonlight
It was a scene, right from my fantasy
She said the things that made me wanna say
How much I love her
(Don't love no other)
It couldn't be, ooh, she's so good to me

And when the morning came around
Well, she had not let me down, she was still my lover
I must confess that I put love to the test
To see if there was any others

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of, oh
She made me love the world, well
So I know she's my girl

I'm on the cloud where no one is allowed except my lady
High as can be, she's so good to me
Well, I don't care or know what the people down below
Think 'bout my baby, maybe I'm crazy
But it's ecstasy, yeah, she's so good to me

She's so very fine
