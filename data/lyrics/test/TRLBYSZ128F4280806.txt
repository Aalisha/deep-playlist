[Hook x2]
Maabin, in the streets, until we die
No more dope selling or robbing
We platinum and gold
That to make them diamonds shine

[Z-Ro]
I bleed the block not with the rocks, I bleed with the candy paint
Sipping promethazine codeine, with a jolly rancher with a danded drank
Telling all foes, got my eyes closed and a fifth done got me numb
On the cool feeling dumb but I'm still on no, come ready to watch you get done
I'm thinking thoed about to unload, on anything that don't mind
Trying to slap patches up out your hair, better say a prayer to somebody to find
But you can't because you the demon, Frankincense got you on the run
Forever living in fear your life, that's why your coward ass keep a gun
You can run but I'm gon walk you down, where the fuck you think you gon go
I got connect in every state, city and town, from here to Akapoko
You choose to play put on your game face, it's bout to be a grudge match
I guarantee if I bust first, there ain't gon be no busting back
I shoot to kill I don't shoot to hurt, I wear the pants I don't wear the skirt
Do you really must know to use a gun, and if so did you ever put in work
