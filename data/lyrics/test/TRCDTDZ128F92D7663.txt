Freak freak y'all

And you don't, don't stop

Keep on y'all

And you don't, don't stop

Follow me like one time

Everybody love me like they do the sunshine

Niggas just got off work

Time to unwind

Strobelight smokin thick (?)

Got my mind made up

All night I'ma stay up and fuck a lot

But nah, I ain't a playa

Girl I'll house you

You in my hut

Thinkin of a rhyme trying to hold my nut

Armand on the cut Com Sense MC

Baby put that ass in the air where I can see

Feel free feel good

You ain't in the club trying to find a real love

I spill dubs on Heiny's and tequila shots

Where studs and chicks pee in the same spot

It's hot as hell

Freakshow on the dance floor Is that you I smell?

I'ma give that ass room

Better yet, let's fuck in the bathroom

If we have room it's a full moon.
