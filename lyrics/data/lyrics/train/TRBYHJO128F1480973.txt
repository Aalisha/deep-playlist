Da da, da da da da da
Da da, da da da da da

So I was thinking to myself when you passed me by
Here's what I like
And do it with somebody else but you can't deny
That's me in your eye

Do you know what it's like
When it's wrong but it feels so right?

Nothing in this world can stop us tonight
I can do what she can do so much better
Nothing in this world can turn out the light
I'm gonna make you feel alright, tonight

Da da, da da da da da, tonight
Da da, da da da da da

Baby, you and I we got what will never be
You know I'm right
