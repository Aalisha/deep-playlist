Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game

Laughin' and a-runnin' hey hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty mornin' fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumpin' and you

My brown eyed girl
You my, brown eyed girl

And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio

Standin' in the sunlight laughin'
Hidin' behind a rainbow's wall
...
