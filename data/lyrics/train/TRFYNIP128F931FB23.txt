Shooby Doo Wop ba baa (hey hey)
Shooby Doo Wop ba baa (hey hey)
Shooby Doo Wop ba baa (hey hey)

My Heart Is cryin', cryin'
Lonely Teardrops
My pillows never dry of
Lonely Teardrops

Come Home, Come Home
Just Say You Will, Say You Will (Say You Will)
Say You Will (Say You WIll)
Hey, Hey (Say You Will)
