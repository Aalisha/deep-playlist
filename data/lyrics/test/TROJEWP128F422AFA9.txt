Whooooee my dogs - did you see that? Yeah!
pushing that stroller in that skirt with those shoes?
Mmm gawd damn!

I see it - don't believe it
I feel it
jealousy creeping
I know you're taken
someone's loved one
and that's a tough one
I seen you out with your child
the thought is driving me wild
can't believe that body had a baby
daydreams making me crazy

tease me, please me
I want you to need me
you can beat me, treat me
...
