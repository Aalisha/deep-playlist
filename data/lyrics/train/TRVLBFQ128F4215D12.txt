Why don't you listen to me when I try to talk to you
Stop thinking of yourself, for just a second fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster, now get the hell out of my house

Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention

Which one of these words don't you understand?
I'm caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand

What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh
What is it? Caught in a mosh

Don't tell me how to do my job
There's the door, your name's on the knob
