He's got a brand new car
Looks like a Jaguar
It's got leather seats
It's got a CD player
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore

I think we're gonna make it
I think we've gotta save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore

We'll start over again
Grow ourselves new skin
Get a house in Devon
