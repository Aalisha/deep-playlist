Like a ghost
Emptiness haunted his years
Still his heart was made of nothing less than good
Insecure narration in his head
Something less than schizophrenia
Creeping him with every move that he makes
Breath he takes
A beautiful walk alone
To his empty home
Where he'll lay and he'll sleep by himself

Go west young man
Your future is untold
You can find your dreams on the California coast
Go west young man
Your future isn't too
Far away
