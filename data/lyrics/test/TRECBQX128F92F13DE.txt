Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, but I'd like to know you better
A-just a-swingin' yo books and chewin' gum
A-lookin' just like a juicey plum
Hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Little girl
Hey, little girl in the black silk stockins
Gee, but you've got my heart a-rockin'
A-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt
And that crazy ivy league shirt!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
