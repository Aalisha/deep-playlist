the time for lenience has passed
a call to all beneath will sound
i radio for back-up mallets
and they crawl up from the undertow
a machevelian portrait crashes
a meteor of steam collides
we will be searching through your ashes
to find exactly why you tried to
doom us all to save yourself

if i could reach salvation i'd take that path
but i don't think i'd waste it on your kind of trash
if i could leave this nation you'd never have a chance
'cause i'd bury all the races...

i see the white blind faith corrupting
the future of my tis of thee
it's easier just not confronting
...
