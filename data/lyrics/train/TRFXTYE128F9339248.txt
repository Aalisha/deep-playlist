Now that shes older

As the embers of romance
Pay two mortgages and leccy bills
Been comfortable and that
Nobody told her
That she'd ever reach the stage
Where her husband bored or her
Or she lied about her age
He's compromising

At least he's got a job for life
Get born, get school, get job, get car
Pay tax and find a wife
And on that note
The end can't come too soon
If you're not living on the edge
You take up too much room
I could've been a contender

Could've been a someone
Caught up in the rat race
And feeling like a no-one
Appearing in the papers (?)
With the money and the girls
I could've been The Heavyweight Champion of the World

At school he used to dream about

Being Bruce Lee
But the need for chops in the Manor top
Aint all that great you see
...
