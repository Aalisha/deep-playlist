I took the long way for a comeback, whack pussies and scumbags,
I´ve had enough of peeps telling me I´ve done that, when
even done yet so I get set for the combat and when I come bad - now where you at - my god damned homies from the southside, I´ll shut my mouth I -
I let the stage do the talking and I´m ah gonna wave you bye bye,
...
