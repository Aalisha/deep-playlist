come make some time today
jump aboard here on this train
cuz it leaves- just in time for everyone
who believes one day we will see the son

let's take this ride today
plenty room plenty space
you'll find you'll be in good company
all the time- you'll be free to fly

from your sorrow
straight into the light
and your tommorow
ever shining bright
all you high and below
trying to survive
...
