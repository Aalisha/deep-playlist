Well I feel so messed up
I can't get clear
And I don't know what to do
Cause I'm neck deep in fear
My back feels like its been holdin' up the weight
And this house and these three cats
And my truck filled with crap

But with every little bang, every little push
Every little step I take, I get closer
A second at a time, usin' my breath
Maybe it's true I've got a fear of success
But with every little bang, every little push
Every little step I take
I'm gettin' closer
I'm gettin' a little bit closer

This life is not so simple
No it ain't just blah, blah, blah
And I imagine my brain looks like a carousel on fire
