You tell me I'm so special
And I'm the only one you'll
Ever be with, and you tell me
You'll never hurt me and you won't leave

You got me bags and flowers,
So sure that I don't know what
Every thing you've got goin' on,
Never think that I might be onto you

Boy, you've got me wrong
Cause you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
Cause boy, you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough
You can keep her, just keep her, yeah
Cause I don't want you

I've seen what you've been up to,
I must say I'm surprised you
