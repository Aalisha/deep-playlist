In a little cottage in the countryside
Lives a man named Harry
And he is losing his mind

Listen... Hear the Spider's Lullaby

It's really sad for Harry, He finds a spider scary
Even the smallest species will make him feel uneasy
Oh, they live in every corner
Oh, and here comes another

There's another spider on his wall... Gotta kill it!
Soon to be another creamy spot
