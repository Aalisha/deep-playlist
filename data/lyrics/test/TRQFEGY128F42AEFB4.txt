The ultimate pleasure's givin' pleasure
Yeah, I'm a Taurus
They say that we're patient lovers

But you? re Aries
Are you a Scorpio, you? re Cancer or Capricorn?
Or a cusp? Cool

If you should feel thirsty
I'll be sure to bring you water
Yes, girl, I got candles
That will slow burn longer

And I know your favorite love song
And how you like it on repeat
Me, I was born a patient lover
So I'll start with your feet

It would be like when hearts beat as one
It would feel like no ordinary kiss
You and I, now close your eyes
And picture us breathing life

If you would feel like when hearts beat as one
It would be like no ordinary love
You and I, now close your eyes
And picture us breathing life
