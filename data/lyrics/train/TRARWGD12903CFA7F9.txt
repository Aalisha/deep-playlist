There's only one more step to take,
only one more move to make,
I need just one more lucky break
and you'll be mine,
I've waited all those time.
Only one more step to take,
only one more move to make,
I need just one more lucky break
and you'll be mine.

I've been so close to you, girl, yet so far.
I've tried so hard to find out, where you are.
People think, that I'm wastin' my time,
there's no way, that you'll ever be mine,
but they're wrong, my love is so strong
for you, baby.
