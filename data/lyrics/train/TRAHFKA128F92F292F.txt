Government spin tells you what to believe
Hidden agendas designed to deceive
Dancing to the tune of the Islington beat
Myths perpetrated by the Guardian elite

Silent conspiracy, eternal shame
Another scapegoat to shoulder the blame
Truth well hidden in a bureaucratic maze
Out of the limelight and the public gaze
