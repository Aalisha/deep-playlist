No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey

I fuck with her, I do
Got the pistol on me,
Can't seem nigga think about touching her
That's true
And my niggas tell me I'm slowly falling love with her
But all this money dog, I can barely put my trust in her
But dog I fuck with her, I swear to god that I fuck with her
I swear, I swear, I swear, I fuck with her
I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear to god that I fuck with her
I swear, I swear, I swear, I fuck with her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'd die for, die
She fuck with me, so I risk my life for her
Risk my life
I'm a real nigga I'd sit down and do time for her
Do time
She don't understand it, I'd put it all on the line for her
On the line
