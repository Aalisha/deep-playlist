He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be

I didn't think that he'd leave me
After saying how much he needs me
But the fact still remains
I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' the lovin' of my baby
Lord it's about to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest peice of heaven I've ever known
...
