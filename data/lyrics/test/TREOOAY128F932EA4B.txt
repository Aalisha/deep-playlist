No more being ok with sugarcoated answers, Last time we let ourselves be so naive, Before we fall into the same rut of our damned ancestors, Taking blinders offwere ready to see. The taste of blood was starting to make you sick, so you stopped biting your tongue, I watched you hang for an idea, more like a passion you would not give up, You believed in yourself, but even more in the power of love And in the presence of death with eyes on a noose, I fell to my knees, said I was sorry, and I died too. Find something that gets you outta bed, Find something that keeps you from sleep, Find something that wont leave you alone, Find anythingsomethings gotta change. No more acting like everythings ok, Last time we take a bribe for keeping our mouths shut, Refuse to be fooled by headlines on a page, And dont ever let anyone tell you who you are.
