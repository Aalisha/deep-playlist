[G] I could shame you 'til you hide your face
And drag you right down in disgrace
But what good would it [D] do
I know I'd still want [G] you.

I could tell the world you're doin' wrong
That I was stringin' you along
And if it all were [D] true
I know I'd still want [G] you.

The [C] world with me might sympathize
[G] When I got thru with all my lies
But I'd be just as [D] blue
'Cause my heart would still want [G] you-ooo-oo
[D] Cry, oh, [G] lord.
