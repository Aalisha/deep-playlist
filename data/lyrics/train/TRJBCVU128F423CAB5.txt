Hey Kevin, exploitation's nothing new, its perfect disguise is you
Your headdress and authentic moccasins
You seem just like a righteous man, exposing our great land
For what it is, the ultimate grand larceny

But who would have thought when you danced, dollar signs were in your eyes?
Above and beyond your large share in Hollywood
You were a wolf in sheep's clothing to a wolf and a people
And your bad actions by far outweigh the good
