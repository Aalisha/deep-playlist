Strangers Meeting On The Surface Of The Earth
Communicating Making Trends For What It's Worth
Sacrificial Bleedings From This Wonderful Machine
Frantically Creating Artificial Human Beings

Moving Faster As We Keep Our Hopes Up High
Maybe Someday We Will Know The Reason Why
Only Love Can Bring Us Forward

We Won't Give Up The Fight - We Shine So Bright
'cause We Are Just A Little Crazy
Dance Upon The World - Fly Like A Bird
Touch The Sky And One Day Maybe
