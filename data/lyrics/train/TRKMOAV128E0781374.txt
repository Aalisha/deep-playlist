Our men which are above
Hallow to your craft
Your craft will come
You will have fun
On earth as you do above

Give us this day some of your manna
As this desert is no Savannah
Spare us today even if we are no good
For your world is better than ours

It's got far more knowledge
It's got far more power
You know the extent of your power
It will outlast ours

Give us this day some of your manna
As this desert is no Savannah
Spare us today even if we are no good
For your world is better than ours

For ever and ever
