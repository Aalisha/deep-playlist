Light me a smoke
I'll tell you a story
Of how the west was won
Flew over diamonds
East river shining
A city sinking in the mud

And in a second
A life-long second
I knew what we'd become

We use up people, use up time
Use up places, we say goodbye
Searching for the crowded hour

Now there's a buzzing in the wires
Look for lightning in your eyes
And I see it there

Hey hey Rockstar
Let's play happy
This could be our final hour
...
