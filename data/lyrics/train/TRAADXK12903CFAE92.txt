Call me trashcan tomcat*
I'm as lonesome as a song
Call me trashcan tomcat
And you will never call me wrong
Meet me in the silver starlight
When the dusty day is through
Wiggle through the door to midnight
I'll be waiting there for you
Baby set aside some downtime
Well baby take off your chain
Baby if you got the incline
I can ease you of your pain
Even madness has its season
Well you know it's difficult
...
