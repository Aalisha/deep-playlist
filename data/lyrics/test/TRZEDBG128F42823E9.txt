It's cold, it's raining
And everybody's hating me
The snowflakes on gallows,
that creates the fall sincerity

(If I break you now I'll break the fall
We had the world and lost it all
You lay me down
You lay me down)

Lay me down on thorns and nails
Splintering the bones
You lay me down on thorns and nails
...
