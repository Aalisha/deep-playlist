Crazy superstitions on my mind
Could they help me get you back for good
Such a striking combination, gone away
Could I save it if I knocked in wood

So I still believe that
Lightning could strike twice for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I find the feeling's gone in me
Suddenly I see that
Lightning could strike twice for me
