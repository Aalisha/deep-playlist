Good lovin' keeps a home together good lovin' sure can make it right
If you ever wanna be without him it means lovin' everything about him
That keeps your man around you tight

It takes a whole lotta women to hold it together today
Cause a lot of other women have a whiole lotta time to play
You gotta be saint on Sunday morning a devil on Saturday night
