You're feelin'
Pretty blue
You didn't do what
God requested! 
Yeah, I'd be mopin'
Too, if I was gonna
Be digested! 
This ain't a pretty
Picture, no
I said, it ain't a
Pretty sight, no.
You ran from
God this morning
And you're... 
Whale chow tonight! 

But hold on! 
Hang on! 
Not so fast! You're
Life ain't over yet! 
See, we're here to
Tell you all about... 
The forgiveness that... 
You... can... get! 

You see, God's a
God of mercy, 
And God's a
God of love
And right now, He's
Gonna lend a helping
Hand from above! 

Praise the Lord! 
He's the God
Of second chances! 
You'll be floored
How His love your
Life enhances! 
You can be restored
From your darkest
Circumstances! 
Our God is a God of
Second chances!
