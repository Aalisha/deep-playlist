Take your life in your own hands
Walk down the street
Lookin' over your shoulder
Who will you meet?

And it's a big crowd out tonight
(Look at the street lights)
Oh it's a big crowd out tonight
(Look at the street lights)
Oh it's a big crowd out tonight
(Look at the street lights)

Look at the street lights
What a pretty sight, ha!

You say that you love me
You say that you don't
You try to get me to jump
Through your hoop but I won't

And it's a big crowd out tonight
(Look at the street lights)
Oh it's a big crowd out tonight
(Look at the street lights)
