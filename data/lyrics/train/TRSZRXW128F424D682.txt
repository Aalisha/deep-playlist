I'm taking, taking
All of my time
I'm dodging words but she's saying the right lines
She made me, made me
Oh so crazy
But this time I feel like I'm doing something right

It made me sick
To think about
Everything you put me through
And how you left without
Saying goodbye
And if it's really over now
Then you can walk away
And it would be the last time

This is the end of you and me
Everything I used to be
Back then it meant something
You're living a lie
You just can't hide from me
...
