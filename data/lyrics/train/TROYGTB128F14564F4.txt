It's been so long
Since I touched your face
It's been so long
Since I had a taste
It's been so long
Since I had you here with me, yeah

It's been so long
Since our yesterday's
It's been so long
Since you went away
It's been so long
I never thought I'd ever see you again

So that's why
Never gonna let you go
That's why
Feel it's time I let you know
That's why
Baby girl don't tell me no
Why don't we try our love again?

That's why
You're the one I should be with
That's why
Miss you more than a little bit
That's why
Think I've have had about enough of this
