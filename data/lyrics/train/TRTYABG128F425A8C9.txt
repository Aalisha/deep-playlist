Ooooooooh

Waiting, watching the clock
Breathing, like I'm gonna stop.
Knowing, this love's on the line
And there you'll be

And I pick you up
In my car
Take you away somewhere

We'll sit, parked in my car
Minutes, turning to hours
We'll watch the bright lights of the city
Just you and me

Dreaming
