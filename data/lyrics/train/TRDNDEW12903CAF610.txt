When're you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?

You are the taste of something sweet
And I'm tangled in the sheets
You left a small track down my back
So chain me up, I'm in too deep
Too much of you is never enough

When're you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?
Just another pretty face
But I want one more taste
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?

Just one fix
