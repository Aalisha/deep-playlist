I am trying to be heroic
In an age of modernity
I am trying to be heroic
because all around me history sings

So I enjoy and I devour
flesh and wine and luxury
But in my heart, I am lukewarm;
nothing ever really touches me

At Les Trois Gar√ßons
we meet at precisely 9 o'clock
I order the foie gras
and I eat it with complete disdain
Bubbles rise in champagne flutes
but when we kiss, I feel nothing
