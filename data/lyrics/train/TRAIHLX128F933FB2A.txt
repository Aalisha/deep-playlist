[E.C. spoken]
Here we go once again
Back for more
Keep it on like this til the break of dawn
Show y'all how some real MC's cold rock the mic and get things right

[Chorus]
Rock, rock, y'all, to the funky cuts
Freak freak, y'all. These nigga can't get enough
Hold tight, y'all and it'll be alright
Low Life, y'all, we keep it live all night

[E.C.]
A Yo, I'm burning motherfuckers like Tiajuana hoes
Got a master degree in these devistating flows
And I know that y'all recognize the enemy
