You've been talking in your sleep again.
about the way you've been pulling my heart strings
when i think i'm on my feet again,
i fall down,
oh i fall down
At forty seven park avenue
loud is the singing down in the bar room
so lonely
i wish i was in paradise
The broken lover in me, girl
has been fixed in my memory
lay your love, lay your love on me

I lost a little love this way
i find it in my heart to say, yeah
i'm gonna shed a tear for you today
