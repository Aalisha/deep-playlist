It's late but I'm not finished yet
I'm stuck like a half smoked cigarette
between mates and the chances of something happenin'
she's in a group, she might be leaving soon
for a club or just a taxi home
I'd like to be in a taxi by her
take a chance, make my move
could be knocked back and they would all see
my mates and her's, it will be ugly
or maybe it'll work and this night would be
more than just jabber to my mates and me
she's just leaving holes in your memory
Swing test to a heart in her sleeve
instead I'll be back at her under the sheets
with TV on and she would smell good
We'll wake up and go to work, the world would be alright for once

(That's the reason, that's the reason, that's the reason)
There ain't no home tonight
...
