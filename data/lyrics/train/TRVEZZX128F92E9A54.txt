Can I explain it?
It's not an easy thing to do
A cryptic fascination
Seems to get me through

A darkened stranger
Who left me full of doubt
She'd tell me that she loved me
Then the lights went out

Jane Doe, what was her name
Where did she go
Jane Doe, she slipped away again
Does anybody know?
Jane Doe
