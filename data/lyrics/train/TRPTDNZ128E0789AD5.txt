Look into my eyes
Tell me you won't suffer for any other
Take away all these separate days
Be my double
Stay with me all through my life
Cross the Bridge of Sighs
Are we friends or lovers, or something other
Be my double, leave the past behind
Be my double, stay with me tonight
Chorus:
One on one all along
Oh, I need to be near you
Be my twin
One on one or alone
