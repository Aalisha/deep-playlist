Early in the morning
A-when the church bells toll
The choir's gonna sing
And the hearse will roll
On down to the graveyard
Where it's cold and gray
And then the sun's gonna shine
Through the shadows
When I go away

Don't want no sorrow
For this old orphan boy
I don't want no crying
Only tears of joy
I'm gonna see my mother
Gonna see my father
And I'll be bound for glory
In the morning
When I go away

I'll be lifted up to the clouds
On the wings of an angel
There's only flesh and bones
In the ground
Where my troubles will stay

See that storm over yonder
It's gonna rain all day
But then the sun's gonna shine
Through the shadows
When I go away

(I'm going home - Lift me up)
When I go away
(No more trouble - I'm going home)
...
