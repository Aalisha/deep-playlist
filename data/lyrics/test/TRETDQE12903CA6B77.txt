i hear your call your lips wont move
there's so much hurt so much past
i touch your heart,
your tenderness,
i met your fate, its your spell

if you falter, if you fail
you found yourself 
in a lonely place
emotions under strain again
you are,
unsteady unwilling
no way home
no way out
no way home
...
