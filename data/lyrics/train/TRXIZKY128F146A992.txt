Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I should've known
I should've thought twice
I should've listened to my own advice
But then there was you
You broke all the rules
Brought to life all of my dreams
But sometimes things ain't what they seem
Now I know that it's true
I learned it from you
I gave my all, I gave my trust
I gave my heart
But it wasn't enough
So listen up, before I go
There's something I think you should know

You can fool some of the people
Some of the time
But you can't fool this heart of mine
And it's sad but it's true
I'm over you
You can take all of your games
And all of your lies
But you can't take away my pride
And it's sad but it's true
I won't be your fool - I'm over you
