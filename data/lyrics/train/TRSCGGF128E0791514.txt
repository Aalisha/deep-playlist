Take your time and make me love you good
Take your time and make me love you good
Take your time and make me love you good
Take your time and make me love you good

Love me 'til I want no more
Make me feel the spirit 'til I have to go

Rock me again and again and again and again and again and again
Rock me again and again and again and again and again and again
