I've felt the power of forgiveness
I know that life can let you down
I'm not blind, no I don't need a witness
To tell me there's angels all around

My eyes have seen more than they want to
My heart has scars that run so deep
There's tears that I've had to let go
And there's dreams I told myself I'd keep

Now I don't give up easy, I got many miles to go
But I can't wait to get to what I see down this road
And all my life I've learned to, just take it day by day
...
