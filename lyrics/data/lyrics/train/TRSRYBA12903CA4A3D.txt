Roses are red and
Violets are blue
Honey is sweet
But not as sweet as you
Roses are red and
Violets are blue.

Ad id aid id mud
Ad id aid id mud

Dumb di dia di da
Dumb di dia di da
Dumb di dia di da

Dumb di dia di da
Dumb di dia di da
Dumb di dia di da

Come pick my Roses!

Sweet from the flowers
Honey from the bees
I've got a feeling
I'm ready to release
Roses are red and
Violets are blue
Honey is sweet
But not as sweet as you.

It's invisible but, so touchable
And I can feel it on my body
So emotional.

I'm on a ride, on a ride
I'm a passenger.

I'm a victim of a hot love messenger.
