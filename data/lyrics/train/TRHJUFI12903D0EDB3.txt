T for Texas, T for Tennesee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma
That gal made a wreck out of me.

: O-de-lay-ee-a-lay-ee-o-ly-ee

If you don't want me mama
You sure don't have to stall
If you don't want me mama
You sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women
Than a passenger train can haul.
