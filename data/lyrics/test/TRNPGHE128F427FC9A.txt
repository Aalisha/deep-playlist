Where were you to hold my hand,
Do the things that we had planned,
Yes i need you by my side,
When things going crazy.
I just need to know you care,
Guarunteed that you'll be there,
When i wake up in the night,
Will you be my guiding light,
I don't care how far i take a plane tonight,
Just tell me where you are,
And everything's gonna be alright.
Just tell me where you are (where you are, where you are)

Like a shooting star,
Across the midnight sky,
Gonna fly on the final flight,
Just to be with you tonight.
Like a shooting star,
Across the midnight sky
Gonna fly on the final flight,
...
