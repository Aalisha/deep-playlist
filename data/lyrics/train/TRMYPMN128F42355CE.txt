Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah
Ya'll better turn this one up
Ya'll better bang this shit, ya'll better get ready

Ya'll better bang this shit till your trunk pops open (yeah)
And your licenses plate frame sounds broken (what!)
Slow cruisin with some goose in my gatorade
No excuses just night on a saturday
Ride fulla females and they all bomb
Upfront, laid back, like the bishop don juan (yea I'm pimp!)
Pullin up to the spot, parkin on the grass
You know kingspade clique be runnin last
(aye yo) Bitch ass get checked you steppin to the vet (uh!)
We been in it for a minute you ain't even heard shit yet
So sit back relax let the track do the work
Bob ya head to this shit till your neck starts to hurt
If you movin right now (yeah), the beats kinda ill
That kingspade clique, (well) them boys have got skills
D-loc and Johnny Richter comin up on the creep
In a 66 dumpbump bangin down the street

This dat beat, that you bang when you rollin down the street
And everybody knows you comin, bumpin KINGSPADE
This dat beat, that you bang when you rollin down the street
