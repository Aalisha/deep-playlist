Taking up my time again,
The one thing I can't stand,
The coffee and the conversation never ends when
All I really need to find,
Is one short clever line,
To pinpoint my disgust it's always just too much or not enough,
And I'm overwhelmed.

So I'll keep it simple for obvious reasons,
And I'll say what I should and just hope you believe me,
But it never gets easier,
No it never gets easier,
No, no, no.
