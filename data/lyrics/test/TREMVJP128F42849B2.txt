Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you
I need one good reason why I should do
What you want me to
Gimme some air or I can't breathe
I can't see so I can't believe
Show me just a little more
Oh oh gimme one

Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you
I need one good reason why I should do
What you want me to
Under your thumb ain't no place to hide
I can't choose and I can't decide
Gotta be a better way
