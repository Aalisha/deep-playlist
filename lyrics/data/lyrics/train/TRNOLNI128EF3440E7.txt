There's no other love like you
Did you see that guy?
Which one?
You're so
Well he looked
He looks so fine
He were lookin' at you for sure
He weren't lookin' at me
So?

Sweet, my sweet, funky thing
Sweet, my sweet, funky thing
Oh baby

Cherry kisses on a summer's day
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
My heart's on fire when I think of you
You stay on my mind, sweet like honey dew
I need you baby like a flower needs the rain
There's nobody who can make me feel the same

Sweet, your mine, sweet funky thing
