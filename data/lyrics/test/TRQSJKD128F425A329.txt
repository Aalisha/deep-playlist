In time gone by I lost my will
To try and find a clear way through
Now it's been a while since I asked myself what to do?
It's been a while since I played the fool
'Cause they said, "Raise your game, leave the shame
In this place where you will remain unless you save your soul"

Now it's going my way, forget the time that I did then
Now it's going my way, I look and everything's okay
Got nothing much to say except the life that I now lead
Is going my way, going my way

It's been a while since I spent the day
The whole day wrapped up in my dreams
It took a while upstaging misery, it isn't all it seems
Now I smooth my hair feeling tight
I'm getting into something right
Living beyond those days

Now it's going my way, forget the time that I did then
Now it's going my way, I look and everything's okay
I've got nothing much to say except the life that I now lead
Is going my way, going my way
Yea hey yea yea
Going my way, aye aye aye aye
