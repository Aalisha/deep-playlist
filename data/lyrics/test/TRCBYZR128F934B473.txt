There are corners of this world that should not be explored
There are needles hidden in the candy
It all starts with a life
Transformed by a knife
Into food not fit for dogs
Ignorance is death
And in this life you've been victimized
Your American mind
Materialized
We get what we want when we want it.
Consumer's head becomes trash receptable
Cycle of human spawned hell defecating back into it's face
...
