What do you do when it rains
Where do you go when the world falls on you
Who do you call on when all your hope is gone
All your hope is gone

What do you do in the pain
Where do you run when you're thirsty again
Who do you cry out to when all your strength is gone
All your strength is gone

Come to me all who are weary and I will give you rest
Come to me my yoke is easy and my burden it is light, yeah
