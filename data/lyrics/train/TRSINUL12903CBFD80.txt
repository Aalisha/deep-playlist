Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me
Over me

I don't know if this is what it seems
Is it real or just a fantasy
Aim to please is all you ever do
Making all my fairytales come true

Come on, come on, come on
Love is all over me
You are the only one
Living in my fantasy
In my dreams

Scared of waking up and you'd be gone
Face the truth and I'll be all alone
Baby let's get into the groove
...
