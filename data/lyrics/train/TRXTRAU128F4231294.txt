When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh, nothing is going right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running (oh yeah, baby)
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, (yeah yeah yeah)
You've got a friend
