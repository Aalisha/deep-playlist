[Milk]
I, always hated hickeys all around my neck
But it was feelin pretty good so what, the heck
The hickey went on, and I went home
I tried to brush it off then I used a comb
The comb didn't work it got bigger, and redder
Giz said, "Yo Milk man you shouldn'ta let her"
But I did Giz, and now I gotta get it off
I tried lotion but it just got soft
The hours went on, and on, and on
Man - I wish the hickey was gone
But it wasn't, and, my girl was comin over
I needed a plan, to try to get over
So I called King of Chill I said, "What's up man?
Got a hickey on my neck, I need a plan"
He said, "Yo Milk why don't you bust a turtleneck?"
