There is a man with no face and a name I don't remember
Lives in a house in the middle of the woods
And he said once “Son, don't you ever laugh out loud
For they are listening, oh yes they are listening

Oh you've got to be strong
Oh, you've got to keep holding on
It's now just a matter of time”

They provide the paint for the picture perfect masterpiece that you will
Paint on the insides of your eyelids
Can you possibly see anything you want to see?
No, hell no, there's nothing wrong with the way I see

And he wanted to be a soldier in the next great war
He wanted to kill and fight and maim but not be told what he was fighting for
And that's the way it's going to have to be, my friend
And that's the way it's going to have to be, my friend

I passed a man on the corner in the city yesterday
Singing “Yada yada yada and tomorrow it'll end”
