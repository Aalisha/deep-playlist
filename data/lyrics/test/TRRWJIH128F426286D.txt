Somebody asked me if I wanted a ride
I said, "What do you mean?"
They said, "I know a woman that they called slip-n-slide"
They introduce me to a girly named Sally
She rides the horses down in Tennessee Valley

She stole my train, she wasn't plain
That woman's crazy and a little bit vain

She likes it on the top, that woman never stop
She's a star, she's a hero

She said my sugar for the time of your life
I'll get you on my horse so you will realize
She takes me boogie-woogie, boys out the back door
Gets 'em all high on her flesh for sure

She rode my train and then my plane
A nymphomaniac, a little insane
