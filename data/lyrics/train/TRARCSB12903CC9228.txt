Two strangers sharing eyes
A look that you recognize
Like a diamond in the sky
Like a shadow in the night

You say you say you wanna runaway
Like a dog wrapped up in chains
Like a midnight masquerade
A feeling that you can’t explain

Runnaway let’s runaway
Runnaway we gotta runaway

Come on baby let’s runaway
Leave the world behind us
