Give me love
Give me all that you've got
You know that I need you, babe
Give me love
Give me all that you've got
All the time

Give me love
Give me all that you've got, ooh yeah
Give me love
Give me all that you've got
You know, you know
I want you, baby

Give me love
Give me all that you've got
Give me all you've got
Give me love
Give me all that you've got
You know I need you
