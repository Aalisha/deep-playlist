[Chorus]

oooooo babe, babe, babe, babe
babe, babe, babe, baby

summer winter, spring and fall
this keeps running in my head
tell me what is going on
is there a chance for us again
and is this really worth our love
baby can we work it out
all I really wanna know 
can we fall in love again


[Verse}

its been a year and 20 days boy
and somehow it aint the same
no holdin hands no hugs
to show you care
dont understand just how
it got this way yeah
I try to call
dont anwser me
go by your house
but you dont wanna see me
what can I do 
what can I say
