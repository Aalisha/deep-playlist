Turn around, look at what you see
In her face the mirror of your dreams
Make believe I'm everywhere
Hidden in the lines, written on the pages

Is the answer to a neverending story
(Aah, aah, aah)
Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream

And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
...
