You said you wanted me to be your girlfriend
That took about one week to come to an abrupt end
I know you hate me, I'm a perceptive guy
I'm also aware enough not to wonder why

You like the guy on your iPod, not the guy in your bed
After the fanmail came anthrax, now you wish I were dead

CHORUS:
If I could force you to love me, I would
You'd teach me not to be psycho, I, I know you could
Give me one final chance, I'll be good
Never believed in love at first sight, but now I think I might
