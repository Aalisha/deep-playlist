I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye

Yeah

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah

They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging (belonging to your dreams)

(Listen to your heart)
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do
...
