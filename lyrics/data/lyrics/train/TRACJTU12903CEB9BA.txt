Come on my dear, you don't need to talk:
I'm just waiting for a sign from you.
I want to command your body to do:
What no other command you.
I wanna say something:
that's on the tip of my tongue
No, the time's too short:
One lustrous dawn

No fear, no doubt, not a bit of shame
You feel the fire in your crouch tonight
I feel the same,
I feel the same
You feel the fire in your crouch tonight
...
