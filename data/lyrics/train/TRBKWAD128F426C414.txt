Take the blood out of an alligator, heh
Take the left eye out a fish, heh-heh
Take the skin off of a frog, heh-heh
Heh, and mix it all up in a dish

Add a cup of green swamp water
And then count from one to nine
Spill over your left shoulder
You got alligator wine

Alligator wine, ha-ha, ha-ha
Your porcupine, ha
It's gonna make you mine
Oh yeah! It's gonna make you mine
