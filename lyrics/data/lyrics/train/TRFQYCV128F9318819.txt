Life, lived in the world of chaos
Leaves me feeling lost and so alone
Oh, I'm searching for a reason to hold on
But I know there's new light with every dawn
Where peace beyond my understanding waits
Through the power of the cross
Christ will give new life

Abundantly, more than I could ever know
Where amazing is so ordinary
And mercy overflows
Abundantly, and love will open up my eyes
If I'm willing to believe
Christ will give new life abundantly
