It's no secret
Somebody waits at home for you
And I know how hard
This is for you to do

So if you really believe
This love is so wrong
We don't have to carry on
But still I wonder

Why does it have to be
Wrong or right?
Why does it have to be
One way or the other?
Won't somebody please
Please tell me

Why does it have to be
Black or white?
Why do we have to hurt
One to love another?
Oh, tell me why?
Why does it have to be?

Can't say that you didn't know
Where this might lead
And I know I couldn't have been
That hard to read

But we both know
...
