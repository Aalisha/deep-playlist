If you want to turn me onto
Anything you really want to
Turn me onto your love, your love

If the nighttime is the right time
Anytime of yours is my time
We can find time for love, sweet love

Come on, sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take you
I've really got to make you
Come on, sweet Caroline
