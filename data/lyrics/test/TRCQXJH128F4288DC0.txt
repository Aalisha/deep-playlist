I remember in the '90s it was all about forties and blunts*
Nas cassettes, Das EFX and Reebok pumps
Punk motherfuckers that were claimin they got tecs
And rockin ski masks like Q-Tip in Hot Sex
Before them underground rappers with complex
When Mobb Deep and Jay still lived in the projects
There wasn't Escalades floodin the streets
It was all about Lexus Coupes and the Jeeps
Yup, what I wouldn't give to see it again
Doin stupid-ass shit, just me and my friends
Like callin up bitches, if (? ) got pissed
We'd pop shit cause caller ID didn't exist (Click)
I can still remember dancin to Kane
Every day with Dewayne, LJ and Charmaine
Life's changed, but this is how it be till the end
Still doin dumb shit, just me and my friends

(Hey hey hey
Try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say) 
It's just me and my friends
(Hey hey hey
Try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say)
It's just me and my friends
(Hey hey hey
Try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say)
It's just me and my friends
(Hey hey hey
Try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say)
(Goin out, just me and my crew)
