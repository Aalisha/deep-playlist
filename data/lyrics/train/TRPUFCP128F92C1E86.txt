Your words, they go right through me
They circle round my head, yeah
I cant believe im still here
I know I should be dead, yeah
This desprestion makes me feel so filthy
But I know If I dont stop I wont feel guilty
Take me higher
Crank me faster
Help me get
The thrill im after

One time to take away all pain
