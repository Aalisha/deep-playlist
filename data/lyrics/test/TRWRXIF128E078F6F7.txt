I gotta love
I wanna give you
much
tell me
bass
love I wanna give
drop it
bass
drop it
come get it gal
whatever you want
do do do do do do do do...
your place or mine
tell me what will it be
I've got something I would like for you to see
trust me now
it won't take much time
I got something I wanna leave on your mind
I gotta love
when you walk through that door
kick off your shoes
take off that dress I got a treat for you
don't be afraid
baby don't be scared
can I touch your body or can I touch you there

chorus:

I gotta love
I wanna give
if it's too much
baby just tell me
I gotta love
I wanna give
...
