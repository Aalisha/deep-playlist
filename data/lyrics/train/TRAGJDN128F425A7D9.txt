I know that sometimes it seems
It's only studios and parties
But baby I appreciate
The way you stand by me
And I know sometimes
you hear strange stories
But please remember girl
You've got a 100% of me

I just wanna say
Thank you for coming my way
You've been such a blessing to me
I just can't believe
I've put you through a lot
You've given me all you got
There through thick and thin

Baby all I need is your
