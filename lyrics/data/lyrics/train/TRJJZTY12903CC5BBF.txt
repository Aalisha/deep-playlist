A hot summer night
I was in my bed
I coudn't sleep a wink
Just laid awake instead
I slipped out the sheets careful not to wake her up
Insomniac restless got me shaken up
I walked down the hall way and out the front door
Took a seat on the steps of my front porch
The rain was cooling bouncing heavy off that concrete
Lightning lit the sky and thunder crashed around me
I saw a man on the corner in the pouring rain
I'm thinking homeless, hopeless or just insane
I called out to him sir can I help you
No reply he was motionless, statue,
I started walking down the sidewalk to approach him
Dressed in black and he stood taller than most men,
His trench coat stood still though the wind blows
Dejavue premanitions inuendos
The car passing by
The headlights lit his face
