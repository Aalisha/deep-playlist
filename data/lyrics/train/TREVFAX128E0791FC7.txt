Light beams through windows
Streams into my eyes, explodes like red balloons
As it reminds me of you so long ago

Wind blows through a hole in the roof
Brings your perfume like lillies to me
And all I can do is remember you
When was the last time I held you all through the night?
Feels like a zillion years and I don't want to wait more
To find you is to lose you, what is that for?
