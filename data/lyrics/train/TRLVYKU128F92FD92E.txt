She was a ballerina on a subway train.
Stiletto heels and a candy cane.
Looked like a number on a station wall,
Hot on the tail of a social call.
I wet my lips I thought I had it made.
Like Valentino with a hand grenade.
I made my move with my libido on.
She circled once and then she dropped the bomb.
She got the big guns, Pointed at my heart,
Bang bang shooting like a firing squad.
Big guns, She blew me away
And I went down in flames I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate.
He said he had the key to heaven's gate.
