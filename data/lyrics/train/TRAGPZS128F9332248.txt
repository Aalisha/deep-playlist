Eh, yo what
This is Andrew E. one time again for your mind
But this time I might take it slow and low
So here we go
It's about a girl na mahilig mag-fax
I mean, you know, as in fax machine
And goes a little something like this
It was a Friday night, I'm feeling alright
I signed with Sony, future looked bright
Mag-ga-gabi na, ako'y nasa labas pa
Nag-dinner ako, well, kasi gutom na
Time to celebrate, the world is mine
