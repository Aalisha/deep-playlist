Yeah yeah burning up the night that was early afternoon won't be home tonight there's nothing left to do
Send myself astray I'm out on the prowl head on hand in hand lead me to the promised land
I'm gonna lead you to the promised land whoa oh aah ooh
Ooh time and again my love is on the line once we touched the sun but now I'm on the run
Nothing left to say come take me by the hand lay down on the ground so I'll lead you to the promised land yeah
