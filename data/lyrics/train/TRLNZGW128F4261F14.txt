(intro)
Na na na na na yeah, yeahhhhh..., na na naa

Tell you that i know life never ends
Because the way you're living in a city
Because the youths still love what they livin in
You gotta stay see world will end

Fiyah fi di wicked, fiyah fi di heiden
Once mi bun mi trymi na kno mi kno life we kno a went
Once my poor pi trymi " " " " " " " " "
As a little youth try they to keep him down again
What kinda juice that me gon catch a day a blend
Who fi little youth dat me gon catch a day a end
