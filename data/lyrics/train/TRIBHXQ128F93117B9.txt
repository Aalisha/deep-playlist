All things are possible
If you only believe
Yeah!
If you're looking for a miracle
Just believe
Only believe
If you only believe
If you need salvation
Just believe

Only only believe
only
All things are possible
Only
believe all things are possible
Never ever doubt his promises

if you'd only believe

From the cross to the throne
From death to life
You went for his own

And paid the price
You could believe

Only
Only believe
All things are possible
Believe
Only
Only believe
All things
Are possible

With all your heart
Never ever doubt his promises
If you'd only believe yeah

Now he goes
...
