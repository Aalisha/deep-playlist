You self-destructive little girl
Pick yourself up, don't blame the world
So you screwed up, but you're gonna be ok

Now call your boyfriend and apologize
You pushed him pretty far away last night
He really loves you, you just don't always love yourself.

And all this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)
All this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)
