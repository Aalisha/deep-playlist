You keep coming around knocking at the door

But now I just won't answer
I've heard it all before.
All you did was keep me within your web of lies

But I've got a message for you
boy

you find it a big surprise.

I won't lie
here's my reply - don't waste my time

Nice try
goodbye - don't waste my time.
I won't lie
this is my reply - don't waste my time

Nice try
goodbye - don't waste my time.
