Jenny's sitting in the car
In the middle of some abandoned Shoney's parking lot
Ripping off the filters off her cigarettes
Crying, he loves me, loves me not
She checks her makeup in the rearview mirror and turns the radio on
It hasn't hit her yet
But all she's looking at is another lonely night coming on

Everybody learns the hard way
The hard way about love
It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere
But make no mistake
