"War... It's fantastic!"
The whole of the world is crippled by the pain of focus
Advancement driving us to obliteration
Our punishment sought through history's reprieve
Self preservation giving way to a deeper sense of responsibility
Alleviate the burden
Equalize the imbalance of man
Inherent motivation to self cleanse
And self exterminate
What is left to save?
As virus spreads the land like manifest destiny
A unilateral disgust is what binds us
As one and against all
Cost for sake of comfort
We have nowhere else to go
