Big city life, big city night
In the middle of cars and lights
You came, made everything right
With a touch of love

Didn't really wanna let you in
Took a time to get under my skin
Wanna see you again and again
And now I'm all shook up

You don't make me feel lonely
You don't try to control me
Treat me like I'm the only
Boy I'm burning up

You can tell that I want cha
It gets stronger and stronger
I can't hold it much longer
Boy, I'm burning up (I'm burning up)
I'm burning

Burning (3x)
Baby I'm burning
Burning (3x)
Baby I'm burning
Burning (3x)
Baby I'm burning
Burning (3x)
Baby I'm burning

Hooked up on a Saturday night
Like a breeze in the hectic life
...
