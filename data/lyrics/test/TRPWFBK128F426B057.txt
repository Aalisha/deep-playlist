Over your shoulders
They're breathing down your neck
So cold and deceiving
Crusade of christian perversions
Heaven's ejection
We're the free and afflicting ones
With a burning mind apart
Empty and shattered souls

You put my heart in darkness
You made the sky turn black
You made hell, you made me
Abusing amusement down the dumps

Revolution in progress
Worldwide devastation unfolds
Destroying what that dog has "built"
The hatred turns on christ
Black souls outnumbered
