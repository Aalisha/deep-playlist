I wanted to be born
so I crawled out in the middle of the night
Out of my mother
I looked at the stars
and I looked at the bushes
then I crawled along the path

Whistling*

In a pair of dusty shoes
I walked a long my youth
I was left with a number of needs to please
The more I walked the more they increased
"we have to eat bring us food for peace!"
And quicker than you turn a silver coin
The magic, the childhood
the night was all gone
