Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down

Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies

Take a ride in the sky
On our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one

Come to see victory in a land called Fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind that has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review
