Wait
I watched you throw out your bouquet
Now I think about you every day
And I'm alone now in my bed

And there's a lake
And at the bottom you'll find all our friends
They don't swim cause they're all dead
They never are what we intend
Or invent

'Cause I made little lives, and then I pulled them apart
Think something dark's living down in my heart
And if I wanted to die before I got old
I should've started some years ago digging that hole

Well I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down and let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
