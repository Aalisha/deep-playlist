On my highway the yellow lines, 
Have disappeared from time to time, 
And I've wound up on the wrong side of the road,
On my highway I've gone to fast, 
Afraid that I might finish last, 
I hooked a curve too hard and lost control, 
Oh I never know which way it's gonna go,

(Chorus)
But what a feeling chasing the sun, 
Living my life like it's shot from a gun,
Laughing a little bit more with every mile,
