Kick it!
You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?", but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework

But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta fight for your right to party
Your pop caught you smoking, and he said, "No way!"
