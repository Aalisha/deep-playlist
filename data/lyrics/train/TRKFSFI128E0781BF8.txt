I don't care what you've said
and I mean it
I don't care what you've shared
'cause I've seen it
Who's to judge if you're wrong?
This is a bad time
Just as long as you break his heart
and not mine
Tell him you're a liar
Tell him I'm a saint
Say it's much too early
or just too late
Tell him that you're weak
Beg him to be strong
Say you're very sorry
but you were wrong
