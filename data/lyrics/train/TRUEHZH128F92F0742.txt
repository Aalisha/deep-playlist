Honey, you're sweeter than ice cream and candy
When I'm in need girl, you understand me
You bring me sunshine when the skies are grey
Each time you smile I hear the music play
Girl I'm in love and Ijust want to say

Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
