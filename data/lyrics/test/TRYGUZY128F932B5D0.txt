Rainy Night In Georgia

Over and by my suitcase
Trying to find a warm place
To spend the night
Heavy rains are falling
Seems I hear your voice calling
Alright

A rainy night in georgia
A rainy night in georgia
I believe that it's raining all over the world
I feel that it's raining all over the world

Neon signs are flashing
Taxis, cabs and buses passing
