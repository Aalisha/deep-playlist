A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
Is not what she's living to day

But she never complains
Of the bad times or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
