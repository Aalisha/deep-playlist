Be my woman girl
I be your men Yes I be your women
Yes I be your baby
Yes I be whatever
Just tell me when
You're ready
Yes I be your girl
Forever your lady
You ain't never gotta worry
I'm down for you baby

OH...

Best believe that
When you need that
I'll provide that
You will always have it
I be on deck
Keep it in check
When you need that
Imma let you have it.

Beatin my drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhytm you play
I wanna her you callin' my name like

Hey ma-ma-ma-ma
Hey ma-ma-ma-ma

Bagim the drum like dum di di dey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna her you callin' my name like

Hey ma-ma-ma-ma
Hey ma-ma-ma-ma

Be my woman girl
I be your men Yas I do the cookin'
Yas I do the cleanin'
Plus I keep the nana real
Sweet for you eatin'
Yas you be the boss
