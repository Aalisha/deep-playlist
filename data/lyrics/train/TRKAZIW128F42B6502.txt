Drove to my lover, tried to discover
If she was my friend right to the end
Don't know what caused her to pretend
So I wrote a long letter on one inch of paper
Sprinkled with tears and surrounded by love
I'm gonna lick the page now with my tongue

Little muscle, little muscle
Wriggle wriggle lips of lizards
