I'm Holding My Own (1994)
You said the only thing harder than saying goodbye
Was saying hello after all this time
But I ran into you with your new love in tow
You say you’ve worried about me and you want to know how am I getting by

Well thank you I’m holding my own don’t you worry about me no more
It hurt me when you left me alone but there’s two sides to every door
And the life you left behind has led to lives I’d have never known
