Time is a wicked master
Put your life into its hand
Close your eyes and it will crush you

Fate only spins you faster
It's a curse born unto man
Turns your dreams into disaster

Save me 'cause the world's gonna stop
And baby 321, are you ready to rock?
Come on and wake me, the final curtain will drop
And baby 321, are you ready to rock?

Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to rock tonight?

Lies, it's the truth I'm after
Let me find it in your eyes
Quick before the moment dies
...
