Uhh. yes y'all baby
Yeah, yeah, work it out
Work it out dawg, work it out now
Uhh. y'all motherfuckers, big dawgs in the house what?
Terror Squad what? Terror Squad what?
I ain't a rapper. I just bust a lot, off the top
What, yo, yo

[Big Pun]
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
and rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
for the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
with genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
