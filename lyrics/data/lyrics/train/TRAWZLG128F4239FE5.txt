I've seen as the ages pass by
I have seen much death
My minions bow before me
When they pray for the last breath
As they look to the sky for the last time
They will know what will be
The rulers of the Underworld will
Make the body not to heal

With the burnt desire
We broke the ravens back
The parasites of paradise
Will prevail

The time of the purification
