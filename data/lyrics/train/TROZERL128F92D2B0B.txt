Eyes are gouged, I cannot see
The mouth that's chewing chunks of me
Been ripped apart from ass to head
Fed on by the undead
Your lips are colored red with gore
I'm bleeding out across the floor
I'm gonna die, I won't survive
But I'll be back alive

He preach-ed and bleed-ed
Brain feed-ed's what the bible says
