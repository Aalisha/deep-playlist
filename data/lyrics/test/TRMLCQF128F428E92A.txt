You walked out took your chance

You turned your back on our romance

You said you'd found somebody new

You said the change would do you good

But then the bubble burst your dream

Turned into a nightmare scream

He pushed you till you nearly cracked

But now you say you want me back

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)

Say that I need you more (need you more)

Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)

Or only what you use me for (use me for)

You never even gave me a thought
