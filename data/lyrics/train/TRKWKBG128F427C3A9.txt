[Verse 1:]
Oh holy place
What a beautiful place
Like nothing I've ever seen before
Pure rivers flow
From your throne
Weary seas in perfect peace
And appearing
Before my eyes
I see your glory
Too glorious to describe
Oh God
You carried me through the fire
Now you lift me high
And joy over whelms my heart

[Chorus:]
