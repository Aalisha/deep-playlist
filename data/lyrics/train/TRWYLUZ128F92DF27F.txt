La da da
la da da da
la da da
la da da daa

I don't need no money, mommy
I don't have a lover, brother
I keep away from the Juppies Puppy
I just want my amarula tree

Oh, it moves me without a touch
People say that I think too much
But I'm as happy as I can be
Hanging by my amarula tree

I'm a dreamer and I dream of what will be
A better destiny
