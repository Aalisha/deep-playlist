You can turn it all around, yeah

It's hard to understand sometime
Is there a master plan?
How do I make sense of everything

So we have to learn to let things go
And simply try to make the most of every day
And have the faith that somehow we will find our way

So count it all joy, yeah
All that you're going through
(No matter what you're going through)
Even when you're feeling down

Count it all joy, yeah
Each moment's a gift to you
(No matter what you're going through)
So turn it all around

And even in the darkest night
If you look hard enough
There's a trace of sunlight waiting there
Yes, waiting there for you, for you

Been searching everywhere to find
That rainbow in the air
(Rainbow)
Whenever I came close
