Been swallowing my debris
Without a trace of dignity
I'm living a fallacy
And been holding tight to all I can't keep

One memory, one memory
This time's the last I'll second guess
Your legacy, your legacy
This time's the last I will forget

So can't you take all of me
All of me, all of me?
Once and for all
Can't you take me?

So can't you take all of me
All of me, all of me?
Once and for all
Can't you take me?
