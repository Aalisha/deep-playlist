I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me

There's something in the sun this day, I feel it
Or maybe it's just my hay fever
The weeds are green, the sky is shining
But it'll soon be night which is nicer
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room
And the devil gestures to you
You've never seen such a Beelzebee
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out
What do you make of this doubt?
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up
Easy - I know what my speech should be

I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell for the company
I want to go to heaven for the weather
But hell seems like fun to me
