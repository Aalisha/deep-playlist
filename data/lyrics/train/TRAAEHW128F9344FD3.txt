I ride my bicycle down the street
with car exhaust blowing in my face
my lungs inhale this toxic shit
and I can see the human race
capsized and drowning, here we are
the bills, the rent, the kids, the car
we pay this price for human greed
in ignorance our insides bleed

Life causes cancer, woah-oh way-oh
There is no answer, woah-oh way-oh
...
