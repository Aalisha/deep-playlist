Just to see her ... just to touch her,
Just to hold her in my arms again one more time.
If I could feel her warm embrace ... see her smiling face,
Can't find anyone to take her place ... I've got to see her again.

Chorus:
I would do anything ... I would go anywhere,
There's nothin' I wouldn't do ... just to see her again.

I can't hide it ... no - oh - oh, I can't fight it,
It's so hard to live without the love that she gave to me,
Doesn't she know it ... I tried hard not to show it, ooh - ooh,
Can't I make her realize that she really needs me again.
