Intro:

Yeah, yeah, yeah (This is Scoedelic)
We don't play games
We take game to spray flames (Y.A.)

Hook:

Now what I look like?
Some type of lame or somethin'?
And look like niggaz thinkin' it's a game or somethin'?
Givin' me that look like what's your angle cousin?
I look left, look right, might be danger comin'

Verse One:

What I look like, if not a million dollars?
Bazillion stages and a billion hollas
What I look like, pushin' that new Impala?
Without 22's on it, is that a true baller?
What up with you baller? What cha bank book look like?
But here's another question: What I look like?
I been around the world Japan to Amsterdam
Spins around the world expandin' that's the plan
Radio Scoe with da radio flow
Rakin' in the dough, blazin' drough
What I look like anything less than three X's?
What I look like anything less than three Tec's?

(Hook: 2x, with variations)
