Hmm, 1993
Yo Liyah, why don't you do me a favor
Why don't you let all of the fellas out there know
That they got a thing that you like, yeah
Here we go, here we go, here we go

You've got that thing I like
You've got that thing I like
You've got that thing I like
You've got that thing I like

Boy, you know just what to do
When it comes down to lovin' me
That is why I'm into you
? Cause we've got a love that's guaranteed

I got to let you know just how I feel
? Cause I never felt like this before
And when you touch me where you touch me
When you call my name
I get a little weak,? cause boy, you've got that thing

You've got that thing I like
