You look so sorry, please tell me what's wrong
Just what are you thinking, you look so forlorn
Maybe you're thinking that I have been untrue
So let me assure you and tell you the truth

I'm not one to fool around
The mistake that I made
Was not meant to hurt you
I needed somehow to try and find out
How I really felt inside and I know I'm

Still in love, still in love
I'm gonna be all you want me to be
'Cause I'm still in love, oh, still in love
I'm gonna do all you want me to do

Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies
