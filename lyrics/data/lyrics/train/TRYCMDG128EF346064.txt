I ascend.
As thy light descends -
darkening the I to reveal the Self.
The rays of Gnosis are burning yet liberating.
In a blissfull imposition of the primal paradox.
Ultimate and all-embracing.
For as above - so below.
As I am lying beyond where mental winds blow.
Release me now, oh saviour of Anti-Cosmos.
Ignite in me the fire of the storming triple 6.
Now oh god of wrath,
unchained in you to burn,
rape and destruct!
