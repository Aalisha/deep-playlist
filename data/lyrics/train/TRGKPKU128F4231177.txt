Ah chocolate girl, well you're looking like something I want
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
Ah and your little Asian friend, well she can come if she wants
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
I want all the self conscious girls who try to hide who they are with makeup
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
You know it's the girl with a frown with the tight pants I really want to shake up
(I'm finding out true love is blind)

Hey, carrot juice, I wanna squeeze you away until you bleed
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
And your vanilla friend, well she looks like something I need
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
I want Miss Little Smart Girl with your glasses and all your books
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
And I want the stupid girl who gives me all those dirty looks
(I'm finding out true love is blind)
