I just want to thank You Jesus
I just want to thank You Lord

Lord, You were there when I was young
Watching me play, watching me run
Lord, You were there the first day of school
Holding my hand, seeing me through
You've always been my invisible Friend

I just want to thank You, Jesus
I just want to thank You, Lord
