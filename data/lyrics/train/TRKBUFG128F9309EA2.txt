Still pitch dark when I fall out of bed 
Seems an instant since I laid my head 
I'm barely awake but I'm already late 
For my chance to get out of the red 

I see foreman much more than my wife 
I'm loosen time in my one only life 
I'm locked in a style watching all the bills pile 
Destined to siphon my blood 

On your mark and get set 
Go boy, take what you can get 
By the moonlight, we'll fight 
...
