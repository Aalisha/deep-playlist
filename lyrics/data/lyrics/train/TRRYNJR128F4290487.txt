The lonesome Texas sun was setting low.
And in the rear-view mirror I watched it go.
I can still see the wind in her golden hair.
I close my eyes for a moment I'm still there.

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight.
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky.
Her memory fills my mind.
Where did I go wrong?
Did I wait too long?
Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight.
