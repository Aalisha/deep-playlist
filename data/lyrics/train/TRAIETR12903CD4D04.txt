The mask she wears can only hide what's under the surface
and she crafted her disguise so well
but I can see through the exterior
of her eyes that show a loss of integrity

In this crowded room
the faces blend into one another as she stares
and wonders if she is the only one who feels so alone right now
but you take it all in your stride
...
