It's alright
You're ready for the night
Of your life
Stars will shine so bright
They say
We're dancing the stress away

This beat
Is underneath your feet
Right now
Together we will meet
This place
Will blow your mind away

Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy

Welcome to the club now
Everybody up now
We've gotta going on
Till the break of dawn

Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy

Welcome to the club now
Everybody up now
