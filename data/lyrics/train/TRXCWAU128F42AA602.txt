When you're near me I have no fear
When I'm untrue you see right through me
You know me as deep as the sea goes
Calm my head whenever a storm blows

When the stars, and the moon,
and the sky fall through

I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow
Deep as the sea goes
All I know is I would
Throw them all away, away
