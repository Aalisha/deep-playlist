I'm ready
Here we go
Yo Donkey
Yo what's up man
Yo what's happenin tonite man
I'm goin to check out a few skeezers over there, you know what I'm sayin
Yo man I seen a lot of skeezers in this place tonite, man

and it goes a little somthin like this

(Verse)

Some say it's an art some say it's a shame
you would give me your body before your name
But i'm a jigga ha and i'm a jigga lo
i'm a jigga wherever if you go
So later on don't act like you don't know
when I pick out the freaks in the front row
I'm the rapper Jay that's the rapper Ex
we're known for playin tag team sex
When I get you in the house you know what I do
well let me tell you a story that's definitely true
When I came to the party I was by myself
