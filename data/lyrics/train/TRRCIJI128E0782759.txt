I don't mind, if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care
'Cause you've got something I can share
Hey, take your chance, even if it's only

Only while we're dancing in the light
Of your second sight
Because when you understand me
You might feel good around me now

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out, if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realize
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination, now pick it up
...
