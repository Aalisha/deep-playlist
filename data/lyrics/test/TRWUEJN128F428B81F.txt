sexual frustrated & soaked with sweat
jack is sneaking through the streets of the city jet set
the fog is getting thick, the man is getting strong
open up baby oh it wont take long

babe you wont feel a thing
jack the stripper is back again
dont know who he'll do next
dont know where or when
jack the stripper is back again
dont know who he'll do next
dont know where or when

waiting in the alley of a dead end street
sticky walls echoing his heavy heartbeat
excited with the sound from her high heel shoes
