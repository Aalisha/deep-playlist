Down where the valleys are low, there's a refuge so high
And down where the coldest winds blow, there the warmest winds hide
And deep in the forest of woe, sweet deliverance is nigh
And deep in the heart there's a rose that a glimmer keeps guidin'

'Til the heaven's song begins the holy files a-burnin'
And the harmony is set to weave a silver sermon
And my heart's aflame until the blessed rhythm's churnin'

Push me on from the danger that's pullin' me
...
