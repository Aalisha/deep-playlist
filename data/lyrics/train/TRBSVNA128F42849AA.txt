Could you go any slower?
You're such a church goer
Got the home field advantage
And all that you can manage
Is to stay home drinking
The thought of it is bringing me down

Could you go any faster?
The night is a disaster
'Cause you call with little warning
Gotta work in the morning
With a head that's ringing
The thought of it is bringing me down

We've come this far
And the worst case scenario
We're back in the car
And cranking up the stereo

You're a wonderful waste
Memory erased, easily replaced
You're a wonderful waste of time
You're such a wonderful waste of time

You're a slap on the wrist
You'll hardly be missed, give me one more kiss
You're a wonderful waste of time
You're such a wonderful waste of time
You're such a wonderful waste of time

It's ten years later
You're still a fornicator
...
