I hold on to my dreams
As they join he passing wind
We travel through the moonbeams
Into another time
Another bridge of hope is opened
Above the deep infinity
Linking different times together
As they vanish into the air, into the air

I hold on to my dreams
We engulf the borderline
Between the future and the memories
Still hiding in the past
We climb another rainbow
High above the swimming with tide
...
