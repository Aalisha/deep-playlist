Switch it up
Switch it up
Let's go

I call my girl cause I got a problem
Only a curl is gonna solve it
Then I don't really care, just get him out of my hair, yeah
Let's switch it up, get off my shoulder
I've had enough, can't take it no longer
I'm over him I swear, I'm like yeah

Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair
Gotta get him out my hair

Cause he was just a dick and I knew it
Got me going mad sitting this chair
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear
