Baby, when I think about you
Think about love...
Darlin' I don't live without you
And your love...

If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday (yesterday)

I would wrap you
In the heaven
Feel it dyin' (dyin', dyin') all the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I think about love...
Darlin' if I live without you
I live without love...
...
