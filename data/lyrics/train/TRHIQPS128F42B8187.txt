Yo whats up boo?
I know we never had a love like this before
But you know, I wanna be that one for you
Yo Tim and Bob, drop that

And I'm not the average guy
'Cuz I cherish you and I'm lovin' you baby
I'm tellin' you to single these guys
'Cuz you really got my heart

You better hold onto me tight
It's not a dream it's reality
And if you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

I'm gonna be
The one that comes home after work and fix your bath water
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll never do you wrong

I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that ain't flippin' out when you with your girls
I'm gonna be
The kinda guy that'll make love through the night

Every night I'm treatin' you right
'Cuz our chemistry is a mystery
To everyone lookin' from outside
'Cuz they want what we have

When I look right in your eyes
I see your soul and I'm the mate baby
If you down you got me for life
'Cuz I really love you, girl

Your smile cuts through like a knife
And what you doin' for the rest of your life
'Cuz I'm thinking of presenting you with a ring

Hope you accept this invitation
