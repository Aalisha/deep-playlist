I could tell from the look in her eye
Yeah, that's the kind of girl
Yeah, that's the kind of girl that I
Would like to spend a night on the town with

Saying I'm a genuine hypocrite
When it comes to choosing girls
With blond hair over brains

It's like a let down
It's time to let it go?

You've got my head spinning
