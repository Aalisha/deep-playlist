What are the things that I do best
That nobody else can do
You know I try to behave as if it don't bother me
The way they still compare us two
What are the things that I know how
To paint in a simple light
Without the glare of expectation or the curse or avarice
Staining the veil of a blushing bride

I'm a featherwoman
I'll give you all my worries
I'll give you everything back you left on my doorstep to see if I would break

Where are the words that I know how to sing like I've never done
