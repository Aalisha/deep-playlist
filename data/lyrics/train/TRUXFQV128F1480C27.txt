Silence, we're standing barefoot
My head is turned towards the sky
The rain has washed away the tears
That I have cried
I hide beneath the stormy clouds
Your lips will blow them all away
Glistening teardrops from my mouth
Touching my face

I can feel the skin on your fingertips
I can feel your mouth pressing on my lips
I can feel your body crying in your breath
I can feel your heart underneath my chest
I can feel the wind, I can feel the air
I can feel your breath rushing through my hair
I can feel your passion
I can feel your pain
