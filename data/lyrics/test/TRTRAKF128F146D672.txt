Sleep well tonight,
I'll wake you t the first sign of light,
If you make sure you sleep well tonight.

Take care, stay with us,
All you've seen has gone,
If you dream the truth will all come clear.

Put me up just to make a stand.

If you could take a lifetime away,
And make me come back down,
If you could take the hours then,
...
