I walk a mile with a smile.
I don't know I don't care where I am
But I know it's all right.
Jump the tracks, can't get back.
I don't know anyone round here
But I'm safe this time.

'Cause when you tell me, tell me, tell me
Stupid things like you do
Yes I have to, have to, have to
Change the rules; I can't lose.

'Cause I shiver, I just break up.
When I'm near you it all gets out of hand.
Yes I shiver, I get bent up.
There's no way back.
I know you'll understand.
