Mary Provost did not look her best
The day the cops bust into her lonely nest
In the cheap hotel up on Hollywood West
July 29

She'd been lyin' there for two or three weeks
The neighbors said they never heard a squeak
For hungry eyes that could not speak
Said even little doggie's have got to eat
　
She was winner
That became the doggie's dinner
She never meant that much to me
Woe, poor Mary
　
Mary Provost was a movie queen
