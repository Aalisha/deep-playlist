The cinematic after effects of alcohol
Have led me to believe
That there's nothing more beautiful
Than a face as it starts to fade

A long string of disappointing days
Led me to concede that I'd been losing sleep
And I'm tired and frayed at the seams
And things are changing in me

It's been two hard months
Since I could call you my own, it cuts to the bone
