Not much of a thug, first to admit I'm a sucker for love
My life is living proof that love is a drug
A teenage love... It happened over summer vacation
She used to call me Slim, she was something amazing
But I was two years younger in age then
Yeah, she wasn't that old true
But I lied like most dudes
And leave it to your sis to come out and expose you
But she didn't mind... 'cus I was deep in her mind and heart
Likewise, sex I'm eagerly tryna start!
Tight thighs I was fiending to pry and part
Now she's crying "Stop", 'cus she's a former rape vic'
Said I could have her but I had to get her pregnant
Though I wanted sweetie badly
I wasn't ready to be a daddy in a long distance relationship
So now I reminisce of Stevie Wonder's
Song called I Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer

Damn... Damn..... Damn!! I know it's you
That's how I felt in the beginning love
Guess I was wrong, 'cus look at how we ended up

Damn!! I know it's you!
But maybe that's how love go?
Tell me if I'm wrong baby I don't know
