Cast aside the light
Bringing forth the darkness
Shadows overcasting
I can see the other side
Open up the portal into hell
Destroying every planet in our galaxy
I can see the other side, can you?
Constellations prove that we'll breed our life until our sickness
Burn for me
I have seen this other side of life
Burn me
Melt away my skin
