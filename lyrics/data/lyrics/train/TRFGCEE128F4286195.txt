If I could hold you
You know I would
If the whole world would
Just stop turning and be real still

I said I? d meet you after midnight
I know I never did return
A lot of promises were broken
I never kept to my word

Crawling on my knees for you, for you
It feels like some Saturday cartoon, oh yeah
If I could tell ya, yeah, the way that I feel
Would you believe enough in magic
And carnival wheels?

Life is never say you? re sorry
