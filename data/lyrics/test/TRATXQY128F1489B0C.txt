Well, it's been
3 weeks since we said goodbye
And now how am I hard, as I try
Supposed to last a whole lifetime

The days are fine
I keep my mind
Occupied and satisfied
I keep my eyes on the consolation prize

But in the night
I lose the fight
I toss and turn
While my fears unite

My teeth grind every time
The visions come, I wish I was blind
They're teasing me, endlessly
With a dream that was, but can never be
...
