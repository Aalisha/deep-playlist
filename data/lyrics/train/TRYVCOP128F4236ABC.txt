[Benzino]:
Now we gon burn this right here
Ay yo dim the lights down
yeah yeah
we gon let the track talk to em


Fly cars pretty hos rocks on my arm shit
you'd think I had the world in my palm
surrounded by the team pockets full of C.R.E.A.M.
still ain't all peaches and cream
cause it's hard being a rich man specially when you black
no margin for error no room for slack
cops stay on your back
lyin tryin to convict me
they wait to treat a nigga you would think it was the 60's
and it

Makes you wanna holla
to the top of my lungs but the weed smoke's blockin my lungs
watchin my son
I know this game is mean don't let him go where I've gone
