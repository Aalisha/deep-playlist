"Well the mountain was so beautiful
That this guy built a mall and a pizza shack
Yeah, he built an ugly city because
He wanted the mountain to love him back

Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love
When you know that you won't get your heart in that stone
When you drop your tools and you stand alone
Hey, what do you love more than love
Hey, what do you love more than love

Well, when my love felt like another addiction
I held my breath and I packed my bags
And I went to the land of the monastery
And the sunshine children and the prayer flags

Hey, what do you love more than love
