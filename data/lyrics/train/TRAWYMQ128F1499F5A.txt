Girl no matter where I go
I call you after every show
In your voice I hear a funny tone
Somebody's holding you
Now you see me on TV
I thought you'd be proud of me
Somehow things have changed (oh yea)

I wasn't over you (over you)
I was away from you
And now you've left me (oh baby)
When sky's are gray
I wasn't over you (over you)
I was away from you
And now you've blown it all away

When I'm on stage with 98 Degrees
Trying to make a way for you and me
