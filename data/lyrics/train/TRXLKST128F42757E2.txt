Keep on pushing, babe
Like I've never known before
You know you drive me crazy, child
I just wanna see you on the floor

I want a superstitious woman
She got a superstitious mind

I can't see you, baby
I can't see you anymore, no more
You keep on loving me
Like I've never known before

I wanna superstitious woman
With a superstitious, a superstitious mind
And I don't mind
Baby, look out

My heart is beating faster, babe
It's beating like a big bass drum
You know you got me speeding, child
