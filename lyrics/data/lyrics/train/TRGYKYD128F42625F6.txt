It started out with a few misfortunes
His daddy ran off with some broad from the Motown
When momma said "we're leavin tomorrow"
Jimmy already had his things together

So many days of thinking of the past
The girl he left behind and hanging out in the free streets
Somehow Jimmy had survived his reflections
The broken glass in his hands, a noose before him

Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix and a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face
Jimmy's the leader of a losing race

Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson?
You always know what you were missing
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem?
Just a kid with no direction

Some people say it was fright that drove him
