I learned to love myself today, seems I don’t need anyone but me
Tomorrow it may drift away, I’ve fallen in love again
I don’t want this moment to pass
I just want this moment to last
I’m buildings I knocked down
You know I love and hate this town so much
Decided I would stay around, ‘cause I’m coming home again
I don’t want this moment to pass
I just want this moment to last
