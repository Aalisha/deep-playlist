(Kick my ass!)

Ow!

Child, I can love you hot
Yes, and I can leave you cold
A cold heart's all I got now, baby
'Cuz that's not what I sold

Look out!

Lord, my wicked ways
Ooh, don't fool around
(That's what I'm talkin' about)
Ooh, lord, my wicked ways
Will run you up and down

Winds, they change the sands
Waves, they change the seas
Child, you gotta understand me, baby
