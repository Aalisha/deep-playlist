The beginning of the end of a new terror, a new era.
A diligent force, setting the course to be a number 1 rap source.
The beats are hype, the rhymes are nice,

no better than nice, they're cold as ice.
My rap style, many variations.
Causing emcees to go on vacation and find a new occupation,
like leading the nation, an innovation.
You'll chant Stuck Mojo.
Yeah dis us boy, to hype our popularity, show clarity.
If you decide to dis, understand we can't do this shit for kicks.
It's our business just like any other,

and you'll discover old time brothers,

at the top stagnating, while others are waiting and debating.
If they should waking, step on toes, you'll gain automatic foes,
but you'll always find those who oppose!

The be...
The the the be...
The the the be...
The beginning of the end
The be...
The the the be...
The the the be...
The beginning of the end

The beginning of the end, my friend.
I grin when the DJ starts to spin.
I look to the left, then to my right, my man kicks the beats, we start to recite.
DooDooraffic lyrics get the crowd into hysterics.
Don't pay no mind to the so-called critics, so check it, the B E A T,
...
