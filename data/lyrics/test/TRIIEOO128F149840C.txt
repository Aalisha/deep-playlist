Maybe when the room is empty
Maybe when the bottle's full
Maybe when the door gets broke down love can break in
Maybe when I'm done with thinking
Maybe you can think me whole
Maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin
This can begin
This can begin

If you could be my Punk Rock Princess
I would be your Garage Band King
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how your gonna be something

Maybe when your hair gets darker
Maybe when your eyes get wide
Maybe when the walls are smaller there will be more space
