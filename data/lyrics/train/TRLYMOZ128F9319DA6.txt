They say, I'm a little too young to understand
But it's a little too late to hold my hand
You know I never subscribe to yes sir, no sir
Gonna learn, gonna love, gonna take my chance

It's a little too late for you to say
Ooh, that I'm a little too young to feel this way

Cause I just wanna be loved
Just wanna be heard
Be lost in the feeling standing here
At the door to my life
Now the day has arrived
So loud and clear
You hear me singing
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
I'm singing
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

They say I'm a little too lost without you here
They say I'm a little too soft and too sincere
