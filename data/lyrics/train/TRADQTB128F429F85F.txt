I’d like someone to hold me
I don’t like the way you tease me through the night
you tell me you’ve got something for me
why don’t go ahead and make this wrong a right?

do you wanna make me crazy?
torture me with what I see but cannot touch
why do you spend the evening with me?
are you not content or do I ask for much?
