I never meant to got his far
I take back every word I said
Blame it on the weather
Tell me that I'm soft in the head
I never think before I speak
C'mon let's start this day anew
I never meant to do this
I never meant to hurt you -
You and I should not be fighting
Life's too short for citing misdemeanors
Couldn't we just laugh about it
Do we have to let it come between us
