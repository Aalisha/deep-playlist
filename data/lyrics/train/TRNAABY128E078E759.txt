Ninety miles outside chicago
Can't stop driving i don't know why
So many questions i need an answer
Two years later you're still on my mind

What ever happened to Emilia Airheart
Who holds stars up in the sky
It's true love just once in a lifetime
Did the captain of the titanic cry

Someday we'll know
if love could move a mountain
Someday we'll know why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
why i wasn't meant for you
