Hey you and will you realize
You're about to lose the green eyes
You take her for granted
Now she's tired of the chains

She gives you clues, you're clueless
Tell me why do you do this
You're so bored, she's out the door
You'll never be the same

But I know that you feel so invincible
But you're breaking down tonight

And this is how to lose a girl
This is how you're all lonely
This is how to fall to pieces
This is how to lose it all
And this is how to lose
This is how to pull the best thing in your world
