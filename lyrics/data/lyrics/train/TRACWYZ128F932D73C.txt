Hey. Let’s kick it
Stopp, just lick it
Let you start it
‘cause ‘cause it’s so easy
You like it my way
And it know it
So let’s do it
Do it, do it real good
Hot, it’s sweaty
Now, I’m ready
Just take it off
‘cause ‘cause you tease me
It like it that way
And you know it
Do it, do it real good
Ohh, this song is not for your lovers
Oooh, don’t stop pushing it now
And I will give it all to you
Don’t you stop now
And try to give it all up
Don’t stop pushing it now
Get down and do what you’ve been told
Don’t you stop now
And try to give it all up
Don’t stop pushing it now
