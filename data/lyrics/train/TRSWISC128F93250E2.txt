Enough with the trouble making
Is that what you were saying
But the words stuck in your throat
Come on, be good

To satisfy the curiosity,
You take a bite out of all of the candies
But you found that it won’t go down when it should
I know it looks good

But do you want to dance together
Or have you had a change of heart
You could run around forever
But I got what it is you want

I’m making the taste
You’re chasing a flavor
You’re gonna be saved
I could be your savior
So say your prayers
