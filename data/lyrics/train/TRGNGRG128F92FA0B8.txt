I've been working all day
I've been shaking it loose
It's been raining for hours
I've been spilling my juice
Nothing means nothing
I couldn't care less
And now that you're gone,
I can't even guess
I've got snakes in my cellar
I've got blood in my bed
Bombs in the closet
They're all painted cherry red
And a feel like a mad scientist
I've got loose change in my head
Nothing but trouble these days
I eat bullets in my bread
