Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Time... Time
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Time... Time

Time... Time... Time is always passing by
Doesn't matter where you are
Time is passing us by
What a beautiful moment
If you're willing to trade
Then I'll give you a moment of mine
Give you a moment of mine

Minutes and seconds are passing us by
...
