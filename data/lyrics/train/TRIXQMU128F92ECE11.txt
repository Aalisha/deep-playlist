Comfortable, don't get comfortable.
I am gonna move this mountain
Then I'm gonna move you in.

Yesterday
This is not yesterday.
You were standing on my shoulder
Now you're standing on the edge.
You've been looking for a sign all this time.

I am gonna show you what I mean
I am gonna love like you've never seen
You are gonna live like you used to dream
This is your new song

So afraid
But you don't have to be afraid
