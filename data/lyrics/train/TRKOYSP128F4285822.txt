Aaahhh

I am the animal
My god, I am the beast
I love to see you bleed
So welcome to my feast
We're serving human flesh
To keep you satisfied
With every bloody bite you eat
Another's going to die

Aaahhh

Don't give me politics
Don't give me public schools
Just keep the cops and t.v. police
From breaking all the rules
