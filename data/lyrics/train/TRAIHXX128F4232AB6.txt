(Yeah yeah), (yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah), (yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah), (yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)

Have you read the news today?
So much hate going round
Ain't no love to be found
Is everybody out of faith?
Spending most of their lives
Trying to waste it

There might be trouble on the way, ey
But I'll be damned if I surrender

Rather be one of the ones
That keeps on trying
Rather be one of the few
That won't stop fighting
Rather be one of the ones
That keeps surviving
I'll be around
Stand my ground
Come whatever

Some say: Choose your ground
