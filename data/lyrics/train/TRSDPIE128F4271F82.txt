I'm on a great height
It's something
I'm on a great height
For someone
And you oughta know
It's you
(Ooh you are my wake-up call)

This love is a way of living
I'm not used to this life
I'm used to solitude
(Ooh you are my wake-up call)

I don't think about the future
I don't talk about the past
I'm wondering how
Could this last
(Ooh get high before you fall)

I get that feeling
A sensation of trust
And I can't get enough
...
