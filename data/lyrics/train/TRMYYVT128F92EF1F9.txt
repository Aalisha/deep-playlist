Standing now without a care,
so far away from home.
By myself you don't know where,
The tide marked alone.
All my dreams could not prepare for what would soon to come,
standing there without a care, that's when you came along.

*Chorus X2*
You're in my arms, you don't even know me.
I don't know you, I want you to show me.
I don't need to know where this is going.
