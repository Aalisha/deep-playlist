Your pale of skin is a razor sharp wire
So I place these scales over my eyes.

Don't touch me, I'm sick.
You whisper, but I hear only what I choose.

Hello my good old friend, your hand pulls me back from that mire
Or will I look back and stare and wonder if she is way back there,
But afterwards my mouth will be filled with gravel and i'm left alone.
