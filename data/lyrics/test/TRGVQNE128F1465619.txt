Come on, come on, I'll give you what you need
Come on, come on, I'm your midnight fantasy
Come on, come on, I'll give you what you need
Come on, come on, I'm your midnight fantasy

It's half past twelve and I'm on my own
Putting on some music turn the lights down low
Temperature is rising and I'm in the mood
I'm feeling you what you make me do

I wonder baby do you ever think of me
Would you go for whatever comes naturally
I'm lying here I'm waiting all alone in my bed
Thinking of a way to get in to your head

I'm gonna take you places that you've never been before
I come in to your dreams, make you beg for more
I'll hold on to your body, I'll give you what you need
Go deeper with me baby, I'm your midnight fantasy

I'm gonna take you places that you've never been before
