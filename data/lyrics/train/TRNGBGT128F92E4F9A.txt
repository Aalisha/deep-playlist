You can lie to me and say it's you I adore
You can poison me and drown me on the shore
You can kick me again when I'm down on the floor
Give me some more
Give me some more
You say I'm desperate and if I'm desperate
At least I'm honest
At least I own it
And if I'm desperate
Reap what you sow
Give me some more!
Give me some more!

She said, thanks for my misery
Then I said, Hell needed company,
and maybe a new lobotomy would
make easier to throw it all away
She said, "I wish you were dead"

Left me out in the gutter
