We'll mend your broken hearts
Put 'em back together again
We'll never let you down
We've always been your friends
This is black and white
When you gonna colour it in
Be there until the end
We've always been your friends
Your friends
But then it's nothing in particular now
Stop making sense, Again
We are the future now
We call upon your humble opinions tonight
Are you there? Are you there?
