Rockwrok
Rockwrok
Rockwrok
Rockwrokrockwrok
Blast off, the walls are down
Cast off, the wolves are out
Come on, there's no time, I can't wait
Rip off my clothes, I'm stripping yours
Harder we're starred, wired and barbed
What a magnificent disgrace

Come on, let's tangle in the dark, dark
F*ck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark
When it's wet and hot you want to rockwrok
Rockwrok, rockwrok
Rockwrokrockwrok

Penetration boys in hotel lifts
Invitations on sinking ships
The whole wide world fits hip to hip
In aircraft, destroyers and cinema foyers
The chastened, the chasing, amazing the neighbours
Gay, wild and willing, stripped of grace
