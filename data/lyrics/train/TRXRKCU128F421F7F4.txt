In your eyes I can tell
That there's someone who's cast a spell
I have tried through all this madness
Now these chains are pulling me through hell
I was led and I led myself to believe
Nothing's gonna break this unity
I didn't mean to be so cruel, to be so cold
Just lead me on to the gates of Babylon
So now hold on when life gets rough
