I'm weak when you miss me
When you roll me on your tongue
When you whisper me your best moves
I almost believe you
But you don't know me at all

I'm covered by lovers
Who recite lines
Convinced that their bodies
Are gonna save mine, oh
But you don't know me at all

Show me where the sun comes through the sky
