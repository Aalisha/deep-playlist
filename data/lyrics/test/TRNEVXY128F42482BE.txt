Outside the walls a curtain calls
i cant believe were here at all
what you see i do believe
i got no place, no place to bleed
ive got nothing left, ive got nothing right
ive got not place to sleep tonite,
cuz what you see is what you get
i dont want your sympathy yet

Aint it the truth
aint it the truth that hurts
theres no excuse
and it could only get worse
