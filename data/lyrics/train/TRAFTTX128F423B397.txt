Don't you worry about their kind
They'll be gone long after time
We'll be here, yes we'll be fine, we'll be fine
All the treasure that they sought
Has led them, bled them, just fear not
All their souls, their souls were bought, ours were not
When they think your scene
All they think, the green
Don't you know just what I mean, just what I mean
All the treasure that they sought
Has led them, bled them, just fear not
All their souls, their souls were bought, ours were not
