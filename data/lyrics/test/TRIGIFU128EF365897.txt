[Diamond D]
Okay (yeah)
Squizzy, hehehehehe
Let's go
Come along as I procede to show you how I do this shit
It's really nuttin to this shit you get to blow and you da shit
And plus the way I'm situated lawyers screamin shit you made it
Niggaz need to change their flow cause that's the shit that gets you dated
And there's nothin to it, I just jump into it plus it's fluid
Got the gangsters bumpin to it, all the strippers humpin to it
And I'm in the mix, got women squeezin in outfits
Got mami squeezin on my dick and I ain't even leavin with the chick
Eyyyy! (Ey) They call me D, I get it crackin
Got a spot out in the A and keep a condo in Manhattan
