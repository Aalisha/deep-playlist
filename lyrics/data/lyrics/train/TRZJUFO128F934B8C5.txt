Stich the lips closed, so that the promises are not in vain
Beautiful lies, broken dreams, fales hope and hidden secrets
That is what can be found in the outside world...

But I won't let it drag me down!

All doors are nailed up and locked,
the windows are closed. The glass reflects the brightest blue
of my walls
so that the sky is always smiling when
I look out the sky its always smiling

So everybody listen up
I think my voice is bleeding
by every second breath I take
...
