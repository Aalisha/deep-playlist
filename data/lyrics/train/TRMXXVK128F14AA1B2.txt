Give me that line again
He's not coming home again tonight
Momma, wipe those tears from your cheeks
It don't make no difference now

Remind me one last time
That you won't never ever ever go
Oh, the whales can't swim without the tide
And birds won't fly without the stars in the sky

Oh, and I can't feel without your touch
I can't dream without your smile
I can't live without your love

Ooh, momma no I cannot fall without your hand
And I can't cry without your arms
I can't live without your love
Ooh, momma
