So, there's always gonna be critics out there
They'll never go nowhere, as long as you care
So you gotta understand
There's gonna always be a man, tellin you that you can't
So if you never spread your wings, you can't youch the sky
And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried
So are you really gonna let someone else decide
Who you are and how far you were created to fly?

You are so wonderful and fearfully made!
Albe to do ALL things great!
Oh, you better know your maker
Cause He's got a plan a purpose for you
And there's no limit to, what together
You can do!

So you might even notice, there's not a single one
Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise!
Cause you just might be the one to listen and obey
