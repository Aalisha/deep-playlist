Brighton Hill, where the sky changes its color 
 Hopes are high, there's no other place I'd rather be 
 Find your dream by a tree out in the meadow 
 Where the flowers are yellow, life is what it seems 
 
 Brighton Hill is a feelin' within me 
 Anybody goin' that way? 
 Brighton Hill is a friend & will be 
 Till my dying day 
...
