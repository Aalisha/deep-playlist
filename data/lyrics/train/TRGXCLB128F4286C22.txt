I can't find an open door
Recall what I was looking for
Waste from haste we fail to see
Stop to think reluctantly

Now? When? Here? Then?
Demoralized, compromised
Check integrity at the door
Cutting throats, dashing hopes
Face down upon the floor

Our goal, to be the best
To find a way to belong
Help the ones who need
To mold their destiny
But good intentions don't always
...
