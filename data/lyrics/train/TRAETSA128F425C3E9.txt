Together we cry...
Together we cry...

Jenny was a poor girl
Living in a rich world
Named her baby Hope when she was just 14
She was hoping for a better world
For this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree

Well she gets that call
Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way
But nothing left inside
Together we cry!

What about the junk head
Could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way
Something for the pain!?
Man you wanna see this kid he was so ********** ' unreal
When he gets that call
He's too far gone
To get it together to sing one song
They won't hear tonight
The words of a lullaby

Together we cry... cry...
Together we cry. cry. .
