I've gotten used to being blue
Same old story, pretty sad but true
My hopes have faded through the years
Ended in sighs and all my lonely tears
Now I stand at the end of a cold, bitter road

So goodbye everybody, so long
It can't be right to feel so wrong
I'm going where the air is warm and clean
I'll be safe inside my dreams

All of my dreams have turned to dust
