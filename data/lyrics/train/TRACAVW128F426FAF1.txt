When you're in love with a beautiful woman
It's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman
You know it's hard

Everybody wants her
Everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman
You watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman
It never ends

You know that it's crazy, you want to trust her
