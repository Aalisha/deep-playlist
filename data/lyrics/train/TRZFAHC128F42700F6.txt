I've seen men look at her before
And they think, I don't see 'em
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But, I'm only. fooling me.

I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere.

She's acting single
I'm drinking double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles.

My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single
