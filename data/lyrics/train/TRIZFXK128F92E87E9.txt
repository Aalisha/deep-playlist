I think love is in the air
but when everyone is listing reasons
to jump into the glass that breaks
at first glance just sit me down
and understand this night has fallen
and only the eyes of daylight can see
mysteries left to perceive.

When the system's shutting down
I should be the first to figure out
and you know what you feel is everything to you so settle down
and reframe the scenario
leaving out the excess radio
cause I'm done waiting on you to set sail and take control.
She is calling me with regrets of yesteryear and all it's tears
scraped out they're not for me, they're not for me.
