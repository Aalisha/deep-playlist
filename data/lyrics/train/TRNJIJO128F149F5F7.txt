Hey, lover
There is something that's been on my mind
And I need to talk it over with you

So tonight
Just let me take my time
This precious love that we share is
More than just a wonderful dream
You fill my life with such a meaning
Ooh, lady
You're my everything

Ooh, girl
Your love is so strong
There's no way that this can go wrong
Tonight I stop loving me
Cause I need you so much, girl to keep giving me love

Hey, lover
(Hey, lover)
Ooh, lover
Hey, lover
My lover
Hey, lover
Ooh, lover
Hey, lover
