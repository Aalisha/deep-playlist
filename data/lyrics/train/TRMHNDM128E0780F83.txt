(Verse 1: Eminem)
Its like a throne that he dont even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
Its like a joke hes like a king but he dont do a thing
He dont want the diamonds want the gold dont want the jewelry
He dont want the ring dont want the loot hes in it for the sport
Runnin circles round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it
And you can love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it
you cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If Im frontin then you better come confront me for it

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
This is the story of a warrior I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It aint healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I dont need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
