You read about them in the papers every morning
The sinners, the saints in the stories
You judge them all even you're wrong so you can feel better
So when the lack of understanding makes a turningpoint
You wished it was you that made it through
It drags you down, you lose your ground, it doesn't make life better

Yeah, reality kicks in when the light goes out
And you'll never know what tomorrow's like
Just one far shot and it's all pretend
These are the thoughts of a desperate man

You can see them on TV every day, bragging about their lifes
Here's one for the books, it's not how it looks, and still you wanna make it?
