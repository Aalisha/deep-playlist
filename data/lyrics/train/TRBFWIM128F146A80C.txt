Ring my bell
Ring my bell

Wonder could it be
Could it be for me
That's the sound
I've been waiting
for

Any time of day
He can come my way
When I open the
door I know that
All is well
Everytime I hear that bell
I can tell

Someone's at the door
I know who it is
Someone's back for more
I know who
By the way he rings my bell
I can always tell
Who is at my door
Ring my bell
Ring my bell

Everywhere I go
...
