And even after it all, I make it through every day,
And your familiar face, is now lost in the fray,
And if I called to see what's going on,
Would you even answer, or have you moved on?

So what's it like on the other side?
Would you stay now?
Would you stay now?
From bar to bar just to get by,
Would you stay now?
Would you stay now?
