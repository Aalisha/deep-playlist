It feels like this, as I walk the streets and I stalk the leaves on my way home,
Look down at my shoes, to see how I move,

And it’s always wrong, it’s always wrong,

But I can’t go back.
I can’t go back,
I can’t go back to her she’ll see, she’ll see the way I look, I’ve looked,
I’ll always look through my eyes, through my heart but not my sense,
I seem to lose, but not when I choose,

And it’s always wrong, it’s always wrong,

But second source, in the middle of the night,
All’s easy but not with this girl,
