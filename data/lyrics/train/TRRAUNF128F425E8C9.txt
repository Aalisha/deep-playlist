With the lights out it's a little less dangerous
Even with a stranger never gets painless
Don't be afraid

Every time I think I'm gonna change it
It's driving me insane
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Do you live?

Do you die?
Do you bleed?
For the fantasy
In your mind

Through your eyes
Do you see?
It's the fantasy
Maybe tonight we can forget about it all
It could be just like heaven

I'm a machine
No longer living, just a shell of what I dreamed
Do you live?
Do you die?
