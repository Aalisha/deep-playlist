I've been watching you
Wondering when you
When you gon' notice that
I've been looking, all the while
Just been hoping that maybe
I can get you right where I want you
I heard that you got a girl, but I can't sweat that none
'Cause when I see something I want, I get what I want

Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't
