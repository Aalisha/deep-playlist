I was born into money
And sold down the river
I was choked by the jailor
And fucked the gorilla
I ran through the country ahead of my time
I escaped through a keyhole before they erased me
I married the beetle and learned to be graceful
It's why all this warfare pours out of my eyes

Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to breathe
