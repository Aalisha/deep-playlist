It's a beautiful day to rest your soul 
If you cannot girl 
It will not let you go I 
Have to strain every word just the same 
It's a beautiful day 
If you think so cause I still 
Have no place left to go I am 
Hanging in 
Caught up in it's swirling winds 
And I hope you change your mind again 
You wade right through me 
Love undo me from 
This everlasting change 
Is swarming in my brain 
It's taking over, it's drawing closer 
It's a beautiful day to rest your soul 
...
