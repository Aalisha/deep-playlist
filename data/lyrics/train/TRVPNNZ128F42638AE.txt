So faithfully
holding tied to every dream
I thought our love would never be
as the sound of hope skips to
my fingers played for me to see:
I can feel now In your eyes

stil changing way's you look at me.
where's the love we known
when last of eternity.
and will your arms still hold me
and your eyes consolve me
baby please don't turn your back

just pretend
that your heart still needs me
and and your soul completes me.
and we will find a way to fall In love again.
it's hard for you

when your heart Is opend up
it's feeling empty
...
