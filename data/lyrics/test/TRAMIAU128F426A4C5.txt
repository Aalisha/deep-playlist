You might be a hero
You might be a star
You might be a hero
We don't know it so far
You might be a hero
You might be a star
You might be so beautiful
We don't know it so far

Please don't come knockin' at night
Never gonna have you so tight
You might be a hero
You might be weak but a star
We don't know anything
Haven't seen you so far
