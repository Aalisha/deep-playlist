All of this comes crashing down
Cornerstone's gone sleepless, hopeless, no end in sight
Ink well has run dry fill it with blood of the scribe

Rest comes easy to the guiltless
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun
Doom, despair, tragedy are the tools of the trade

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste
...
