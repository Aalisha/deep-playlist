Can't you hear me screaming, once again?
Voices you can't hear
Because you are consumed and incontent
With everlasting greed

Don't you see me on my hands and knees?
Begging and bleeding
You're smiling as you bite the hand that feeds
But will you never see?

Always wanting what your eyes can't see
[Needing what your arms can't reach]
Thinking you are in need
Always hearing what your ears can't hear
[Feeling what your hands can't touch]
Thinking you are incomplete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through
(Never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
