She's a liar, it comes to this
All we had till now is gone
And I'm the other, piece to this
Every time I feel this inside
I don't wanna be the one who

Caught you, so take cover
Never saw it coming so you put me on again
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

She starts feeling on her own
She makes the city seem like home
