But you make everything alright, when you hold and you squeeze me tight
you make me feel so nice, when im around with you
wake up in the mornin and i will spend my whole life with you
the sweetness of your smile helps away with all of my fears.

if it should all go wrong our lives'll come to tears
iv never been so deep into anyone else but you
a place within my heart
never been so close to you.
and if you want me to hang around then i'll never let go
ill give you all my time, stick around with you for sure

but you make everything alright, when you hold and you squeeze me tight.
