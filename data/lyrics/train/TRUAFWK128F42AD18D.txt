And the sun won't shine for me
And it seems like nothing's goin' right
There's a place I want to be

Just layin' there beside you
In the shelter of your room
I leave the world outside your door
Lose myself in you

When you're in my arms
I find all that I need
I could never live without
The Heaven that you showed me

I've been waitin' all my life
Just to look into your eyes
I live for the time alone with you

And when I climb the stairs to find you
And we reach for the light
I thank God I've got
This time alone with you, oh yeah
...
