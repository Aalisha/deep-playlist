The roads are closed
Do you know where you should be?
When the lights are dim
Are you gonna come cryin' to me?

'Cause you're sitting there with your legs crossed
Lookin' so carefree
Do you think you can run away
From your so-called misery?

'Cause you know, the tide ain't rollin' in for you
The tide ain't rollin' in for me
Are you gonna sink, are you gonna swim?
Because I'll take you down to the river
Yes, I'll take you down to the river
In the end, I'll take you down to the river
