You put me in the clutches of sin
Making me a burning specimen
Of worn animosity, just to aspire
Leaving absolutely nothing behind

But now it seems that the tables have turned
Another dead end, another lesson learned
One good turn deserves another
So here it is, motherfucker

You're just a semi-automatic hate machine
Semi-automatic hate machine
Semi-automatic hate machine
And I've gone ballistic
