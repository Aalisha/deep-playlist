Don't slander me, don't slander me, my my
Never say don't I don't know why
Don't slander me just, just for me, you, and I, I
Don't slander me, don't slander me, my my

Cause Gods will bring the devil the blues
And the blues would not themselves excuse
Don't come from the blues if the blues are empty hell is filled
Don't slander me, my my my don't slander me nil

Don't slander me, don't slander me, my my
Never say don't I don't know why
Don't slander me just, just for me, you, and I, I
Don't slander me, don't slander me my my

Cause Gods will bring the devil the blues
and the blues are not themselves excused
Don't come from the blues if the blues are empty hell is filled
Don't slander me, my my my don't slander me nil
