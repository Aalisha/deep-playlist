Rockin' after midnight
We'll be rockin' after midnight (repeat)
After midnight, girl
After nidnight, baby
It's time to rock, ooh
Let me rock you, rock you
Rock you into midnight, baby
Let me rock you into love
I know you give me lots and lots of good lovin' baby
After midnight, baby
The time, the time is right for you and me tonight
But now we've got to dance
And soon after we make romance
You know I need your love
Worser than the stars above
Darling don't hesitate
After the date, oh, no, no, no-o-o
Sweetheart, your so good to me
Your precious lovin' can't be beat
Oh my sweet
I love the way you do your thing
