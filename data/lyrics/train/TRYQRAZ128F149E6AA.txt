You don't have to tell me what you're still looking for,
Two arms to hold you and a voice to say "That's alright, you can spend the night"
Well, come around.

'Cos I've been there and these are the notes from the overground,
The World Saxophone Quartet, the smell of violets
And a passing friend won't let you down.

Listen to the rhythm of the rain falling,
Say you're gonna change your foolish ways.
