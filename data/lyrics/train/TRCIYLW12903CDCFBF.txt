Get yo' [repeat]
Back-back-back [repeat]

This revolution
starts when you're movin
Don't want to step to me
unless you plan on loosin'
not here to brag
not here for thrills
I'm in a battle baby
I dress to kill
fall in

shakin' like a leaf buckling at the knee
stop draggin your feet
[time to go all in]
time for standing tall
move to kill 'em all
no one lose control
[get your back off the wall]

Get your back off the wall
get your back off the wall
get your back off the wall
get your back off the wall
get your get you get your back
get your back off the wall
get your get your get your back
...
