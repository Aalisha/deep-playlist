Oh summerday,
oh summerday,
oh what a beatiful day
When all the boys
and all the girls will
hit the funky wave
There is no good,
There is no bad,
there is no self-control
I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna die
on a dancefloor

Let's dance
Come on my baby
Let's dance
You drive me crazy
Let's dance
You look so good now
Let's dance
We would do all night
...
