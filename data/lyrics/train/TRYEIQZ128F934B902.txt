It's ok, it's ok, it's ok we've seen enough.
staring straight, staring straight, straight into the setting sun.
let the light burn our retinas and our callused skin
all you will have is anger and the money you cash in

wishing to contact, but contracts put us out
you can fool us once but we won't be the same again
