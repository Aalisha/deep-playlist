Standing on the top of the world (4x)
Standing on the top of the world
Standing on the top of the world
Standing on the top it's a long way down.
It's too easy to feel conceit
Its too easy to feel elite
The propaganda that you're fed.
Don't think you can count on it
When you judge yourself.
Supremacy means there's no conscience here
Supremacy means there's no compassion here.
