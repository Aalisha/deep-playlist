When I first saw you baby, I wanted to die
Me and those dreaming eyes of mine, started to cry
Then I'd dream, wishing my fantasy
Would soon become a reality

'Cause every time I see you baby, all I do is sigh
'Cause you're the most precious thing
That my dreaming eyes has ever seen
So I'll continue to dream
Me and those dreaming eyes of mine

Is it just that you're the finest little thing
That I ever saw, or is my imagination running too far
Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you, or you being with me

Ooh we baby, you've redefined my vision of love it seems
