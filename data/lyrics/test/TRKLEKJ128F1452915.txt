If I never get to love you it won't be 'cause I didn't try
I'll be trying to possess you 'til the day I die
If I never get to love you it won't be 'cause I run away
For as long as you will have me close to you, I'll stay

What I wouldn't give to hold you tight?
Never, never let you out of sight
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning
The last one you kiss goodnight
