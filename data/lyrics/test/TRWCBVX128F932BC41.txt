I have watched the river bed dry up
Covered by the orange clay dusted and cracked and peeling
Know that time is the enemy
If I'm not ready now I may never be
Feel all the indifference locked up and cauterized
Coursing through my veins
Let all dreams come crashing down
I have relied on wasting all I could be
