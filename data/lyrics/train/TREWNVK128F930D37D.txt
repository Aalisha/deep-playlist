I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby, 
I like it that way but then again, maybe. 

I'm nobody's valentine & I'm nobody's pearl 
When you get right down to it I always seem to always find just 
Some girl singin' 

There are monsters, there are angels. 
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all. 
There's sugar & there is salt 
There's ice and there is fire. 
In every single heart, there are monsters, there are angels. 

I'm nobody's promise and I'm nobody's chore 
And I ain't got nobody that I feel I gotta
