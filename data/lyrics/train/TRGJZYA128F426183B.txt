If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Because you're baby is so far away

Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

Don't be angry, don't be sad
Don't sit crying talking 'bout the good times you've had
Well, there's a girl sitting right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do

Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
...
