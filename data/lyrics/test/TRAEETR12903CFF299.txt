Time of the fallen has come as the darkness falls.
Beneath the earth our army dwells in the ancient halls.
Hunger for death tearing our souls apart.

Nest of havoc, the fortress of hideous mind.
Once the fallen shall arise.

Shadow over (the) lands, the light fades away.
Faith and hope drowning in the pool of blood.
