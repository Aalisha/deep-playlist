Hey
Hey
Hey

Riddle me this my brother, can you handle it?
Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night

It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock, we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds, we contribute to

I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Well, who shall inherit the earth, the meek shall
And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now Al

And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
We're just 3 M.C.'s and we're on the go
Shadrach Mesach Abednago

Shadrach Mesach Abednago
Shadrach Mesach Abednago
Shadrach Mesach Abednago
Shadrach Mesach Abednago

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey yeah

Ahh, only 24 hours in a day
Only 12 notes, well, a man can play
Music for all and not just one people
