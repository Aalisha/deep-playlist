First thing in Monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day
You see the thing 'bout love is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain

There comes a time when we could
All make a change darling

Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right you know
Just let go, let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go baby

Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody want no two time losers oh no
...
