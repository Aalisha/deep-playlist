Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets
Blood spillin' in the streets, the what?
Blood spillin' in the streets

Aiyyo wit two precise niggaz, holdin' the right biscuits
There'll be a lot of cats leakin' out they life liquid
Niggaz who actin' hard this ain't Columbia Pictures
When we throw two in yo' ass while you huggin' on your mistress

From Philly, where cats quick to mute you at
Cuckoo cats, twist back your FUBU cap
Crucial black, two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a pool stick where you doodoo at

While you checkin' on your pagers, weapons in your faces
Shot blazin', cops section off the pavement
Hoppin' out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in

Mouthin' off fakin'll make you a loud patient
Achin', with your arms in a alcohol basin
And while your brain's achin' I'ma have your dame slavin'
Cocaine and apron, over a flame bakin'

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon or y'all be checkin' for leaks
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Niggaz take it for granted until they layin' dead on the granite
Innocent bystanders get shot by standin'
Y'all shoulda ducked when y'all heard the cannon, now you layin' deceased
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin' in the streets

Can you feel it? Nothin' can save ya
'Cause this is the season of the infrared laser
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is show you how you can get spotted by one too
