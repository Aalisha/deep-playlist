Lights Out

(female)
Baby...
I can't sleep...
Can you tell me a lullaby...

Uh...
Heh...
A Lullaby...

Excuse me sista
wats up wit ya
Let me holler at ya
Try to paint a picture
Of you and I
Champagne in ice
Little candle light
To set the mood right
Can you picture that
then get ya hat
And get ya coat
Cause we can roll
Back to my spot
I'm in the parking lot
Come on let's drop the top
Cool you off...
Cause girl your so fine...

Your body is so
...
