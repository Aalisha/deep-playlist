I'm rushing through the cosmos,
Reaching the light from the beyond the sun
I see my self dissolving, as universe locks me into its arms
When you dream of the sea of stars
And in the sky the northern lights flame
Sometimes do you remember, hear the silence between the worlds

Swirling surges of plasma, permeate me as i continue my fall
