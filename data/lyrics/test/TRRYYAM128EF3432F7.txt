It's your oldest trick and your cheapest one
Turn the world to blank and the game is done
I hope and I pray that the rainbow comes
You'll change your mind, don't shoot the gun

You can sail on seven seas
Lend your heart out to who you please
Wherever you travel, whatever you see
Don't forget the love you got from me
