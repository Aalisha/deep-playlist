Last time I saw her, she was running
Laughing, swirling high above the ground
People stop and check and watch her coming
Crazy little mama going 'round and 'round

Last time I touched her, she was burning
Through a heat of ever lasting light
Drifting through her fires my ceaseless yearning
Flaming little mama, will you burn all night?

Hey, will you burn all night?
Hey, will you burn all night?
Oh yeah
