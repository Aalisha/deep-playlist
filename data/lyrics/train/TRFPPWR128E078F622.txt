Remember just two years ago
when our bands were playing house shows 
were fighting for 
to make a change 
to live our lives the way we dreamed 
despite what they might say 

remember how we struggled though 
remember nights we spent on hard wood floors 
were fighting for 
to make a change 
to live our lives the way we dreamed 
despite what they might say 

you're there when i fall 
you'd help me be strong 
even when i lost my faith 
we're standing so tall 
...
