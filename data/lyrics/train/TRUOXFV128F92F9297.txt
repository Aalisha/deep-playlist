Baby girl
Drop your guard, I won't hurt you no
Baby I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your knight in shinin' armour
But baby you gotta let me

Just like in the movies baby, ima come to ya rescue
Ima rescue you
And i know this might sound crazy, but I think i'm here to protect you
So girl, can you stop running
This aint that kinda lovin i got ya
Just run into my arms and i will show you

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Cause i can be your everything
Your superman whatever you need
I can be
Just run into my arms

Baby girl, youve been hurt
