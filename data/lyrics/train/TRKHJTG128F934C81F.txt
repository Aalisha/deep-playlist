Ooooh, dance crasher
Oo-oo-oo-ooh, dance crasher
Oh no no
Don't break it up
Please don't make a fuss
Don't use a knife
Take another feel(?) of life
You'll be sorry, you'll be so sorry
You'll be sorry, let me tell you, wha-oooo
There is a debt sometimes, wha-oooo
You won't have a chance, wha-oooo
That will be your last dance, wha-oooo
Ooooh, dance crasher
Oo-oo-oo-ooh, dance crasher
Oh no no
