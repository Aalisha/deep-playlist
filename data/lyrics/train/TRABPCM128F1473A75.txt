Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the word is love to me
Your beauty and the gentle magic of your soul live here in my memory
Golden evenings in pink white veils sounds of the river telling ancient tales

Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the ringing in my ear
As I wander through another light in search of someone soft I once held near
Time glances the other way, lifeâ€™s sweet shadow makes night his day
