I love the way you love to live
you got life, you're inspiration
i love the way that you do
your heart's so freely
you're a sweet sensation
you're my invitation to happiness
you're full of sweet surprises happiness
you fill my heart desire
more, more, more and more
and over and over again
keep that goodness coming
I love the way you watch the world
