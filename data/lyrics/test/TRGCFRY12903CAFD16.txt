This spirit is holding us down
We shit our shoulders are in deep
Pulling us to the light
Toasted our backs in the sun
And I waited for the next call
We got all out ears pressed against the wall

But now our days are set straight
We're seeing it all eye to eye
The balance is still chasing after
Just hanging on as you walk by
