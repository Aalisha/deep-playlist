Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
Forever, yeah if we're together
We can make it better

You and I
We never get to sleep we're up all day
We're overworked and under paid
You and I
We're always stuck in repeat day by day
Watching time drift away as we burn away

Without you, there's no reason for my story
And when I'm with you I can always act the same
...
