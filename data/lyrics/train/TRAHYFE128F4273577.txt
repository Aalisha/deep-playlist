"I Can't"

Uh, y'know, uh, Boogie Brown, uh
How you expect me to love you, nigga
Can't even trust you, uh

So he played you, right?
Shot a little game then he blazed you, right?
Talkin' 'bout he was gon' make you wife then make you right
And the last you seen was his car break lights

He fooled you girl, pussy is power, let me school you girl
Don't get up off it 'till he move you girl
And let no playin' nigga rule your world and screw you girl

I got 'em hatin' me, I throws the pussy down, keep 'em chasin' me
Basically, niggas game a lot, so bet I game back
And make the nigga think that I came a lot
And I change the plot, when we was at Jacob
That chain was hot, is he on or what?
Nigga cop the broach in the double R
And you got the notes, so I know you not broke, nigga

- (I ain't fuckin' wit' you)
I can't rock with you no more
(You and your bullshit)
(How can I love you)
(Can't even trust you)
