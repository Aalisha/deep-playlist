The moment came and us passed by
Is this our fate, complacency?
Nothing's changed and nothing will
As we dismiss the mistakes

There's no action, we hesitate
Stay in line, and walk straight
We've been tamed, domesticated
By our fear that dominates

We have, we have been calmed
But I remember a revolution song
We have, we have been calmed
But I remember a revolution song

I recall warning signs
