Ooh yeah
Never had a feeling
Of love like this
Never thought my life could change
With just one kiss
Never had a reason
To spread my wings and fly
Never saw forever
Until I looked in your eyes
Like a light that shines away
Through all my darkest hours
Your love, it flows through me
And I feel the power
'Til the clocks run out of time
'Til the stars refuse to shine
I will hear you when you call
And I'll catch you when you fall
'Til the rivers all run dry
And the sun falls from the sky
This much I know is true
...
