All the songs that I've sung here
More often than you know
'Cause you're the lull that I've countered
More often than I've let it show

And I, I wish you would leave me
And I, I wish you would go
And I, I wish you didn't need me
And I, I wish I didn't love you so

'Cause I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No, I won't do you harm
...
