So quiet, the fuckers are bombing no more
Covered with ashes and blood, I rise to see the end
The future is now, past and presence - all burning
Am I the last one alive? What will become of me?

One last trail leading throught death and destruction
Guided by the flesh in fire - can this really be the way?
Terror is speaking my name - join the nightmare, my friend!
But determined I walk the path of no life...

Searching for a will to live but I cannot find it!

This is horror!
This is terror!
Why doesn't everything go away?
This is madness!
The way of pain
One man alone to start again
