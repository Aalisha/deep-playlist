(Shel Silverstein - Jim Friedman)

When I was a lad in a fishing town an old man said to me
You can spend your life, your jolly life just sailing on the sea
You can search the world for pretty girls till your eyes're weak and dim
But don't go swimming with a mermaid son, if you don't know how to swim.

'Cause her hair is green as seaweed and her skin is blue and pale
And I tell you now before you start you can love that girl with all your heart
But you're just gonna love the upper part you're not gonna like the tail.
