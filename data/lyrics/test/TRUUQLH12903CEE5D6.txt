Do you want a candy? Hey baby
With a different taste, I want this
Do you need it?
Come and eat your cake

Do you want a candy? Hey baby
With a cherry on top
Do you want it, do you need it?
'Cause the cake comes hot

I'm not afraid of no love
And I pick whatever flavor I want
I'm not afraid of too much
And I don't get tired of playing along

I'm not afraid of no love
And I'll rock you any way that I want
I'm not afraid of your stuff
And I'm sure I'll keep you running

One touch and I know you're there
There is something up in the air
It just takes me over

One touch and I know you're there
There is something up in the air
It just takes me over

Hips, lips, fashion status
I get my kicks
Conscious of the rich life and the famous
...
