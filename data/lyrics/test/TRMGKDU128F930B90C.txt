Young life began filled with hate
No time to think about the fate
Not when this child can spite the heavens gate.

Mind like an arrow, filled with ice
Where is the truth, where are the lies?
These sad questions we can see from your eyes.

Your wicked manners start remind us of the man we used to know
all the rain and fire, starts before the show.
with thunder and lightning you fill your heart that wasn't whole
To the surface

Some call you chosen one, but that's just a lie
...
