I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight

Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun

I know more than I knew before
I know more than I knew before
I didn't rest, I didn't stop
Did we fight or did we talk?

Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun
