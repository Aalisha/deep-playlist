Born with heaven in their eyes
God-sent
Innocent
The promise of life
Born into this mess we've made
Holding the future
And hope of better days
'Cause there is nothing
More beautiful and wild
Than the dreams that grow
In the heart of every child

They are the roses
They are the lights that shine
They are the waves that
Roll in on the ocean tide
They are angels
They are souls in flight
They are the hope that
Everything's gonna be all right
They are the roses
