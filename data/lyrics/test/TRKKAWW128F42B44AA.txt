When it comes calling, will you heed the call?
When it gets heavy, now, will you let it fall?
And as the loon cries, it opens minds

The stream reflects these Northern climes
Through these days, we walk the line
Sixteen dollars and a couple of dimes

There've been a number of times
Took a step back, couldn't read the signs
Cross the plains till they start to climb

Down to the valley where the river winds
Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high

Grey skies, waters rise
Mind flood's gonna break the bank
Will it wash us away, now?
Will it wash us away, now?

Blue skies, the river dries
A light goes out before your eyes
Till the break of day, now
...
