If you wanna pay attention to me
You don't have to pay, you got it for free
24 hours ain't enough of you
When you thrill me girl like you do

Go on and knock yourself out
Go ahead and knock yourself out
Don't stop knock yourself out girl with me
Girl with me

It's a mighty love
It's a real, real, real, real mighty love
Go on and knock yourself out

Five long years I waited for this
Heaven on earth and all the bliss
Once upon a time when I was a wreck
I measured 12 on the misery index
