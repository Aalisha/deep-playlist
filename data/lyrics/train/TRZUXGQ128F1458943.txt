Sometimes the comfort of a room
Sometimes I'm quite alone
I pack to leave a foreign town
It seems I'll never know

But I'll rent new accommodation
We'll make plans for mobile homes

Slow boats moving with the tide
Drifting far from shore
It's the nature of this country life
I've never known before
Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses
From mobile homes

Plant life
My life
...
