As a child my mind was open wide
Seeing many wonders all the time
I had to close it just to survive
At school they tried to break my soul

And trying to push me in an automatic life mode 
I couldn't live my life that way
It's bad for my health
Never lose your sense of wonder
Even if you lose all else
