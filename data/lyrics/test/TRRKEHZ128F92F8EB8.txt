Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
In a tomb, in bloom

Down in a hole, and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now, a man Who won't let himself be

Down in a hole
Feeling so small
Down in a hole
Losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
...
