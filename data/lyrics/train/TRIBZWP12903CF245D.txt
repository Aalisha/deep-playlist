You try to hide
The fact hidden from yourself
Your own favourite entertainer
Is none other than
The one we call you
And you need the others
To fortify your disgust
For the worst of us, to the rest of us

Entertain the thought that
We are still alive
Entertain the notion
Of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions
And our fears
Just pull us in
And take us down

I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
...
