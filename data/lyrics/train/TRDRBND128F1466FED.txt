You talks as if in riddles
You talk as if in rhymes
Down in the lion's lair
Stroke yourself to feel so fine
And what are you afraid of
Afraid to get so touched
When you begin to feel
Is it way, way too much

Have you lost your sense of purpose
And who can stand alone
There's no more circus here
There's nothing carved in stone
I see you down in the desert
And on a lonely beach
I'll hold you in those places
Where no one else can reach you

For comfort there

CHORUS
In your wildest dreams
...
