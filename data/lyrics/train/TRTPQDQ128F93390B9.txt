And all of these days they pass like water
Should I even tighten the grip of my hand?
I get the sense that we're all chasing after
The same simple thing that I don't understand
To carry you on
And you wear a color that I don't remember
Your hair so much shorter than it used to be
Years cannot change all the secrets we gathered
Years cannot change what you still mean to me
