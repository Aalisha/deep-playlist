It was simple until I started to question
The answers i started testing
To find the truth
Between the lines
To decipher all these signs

I thought,
There's gotta be something more to
This gravity that pulls us toward you
I found the proof I thought I needed
Looked in the mirror
Yea I was breathing

Close your eyes
Free your mind
Realize
We're connected
