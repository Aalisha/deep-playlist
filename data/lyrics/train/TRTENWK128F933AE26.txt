Every morning about half past eight
My Mummer wakes me says
Don't be late
Get to the office, trying to concentrate
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill

So I stop one day to figure it out
I'll quit my job without a shadow of a doubt
To sing the blues that I know about
My life is just a slow train crawling up a hill

Minute after minute
Second after second
Hour after hour goes by
Working for a rich girl
Staying just a poor girl
Never stop to wonder why
