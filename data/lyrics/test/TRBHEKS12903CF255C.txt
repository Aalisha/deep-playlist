i will take the law in my hands i will control my destiny (x4)
My hates strengthened by my silence
filling my head with thoughts of violence.
My resolve is tested daily, Anger hostile (intentions)
We must open our ears
and listen to the agony of earths condition.
You are the cause, i am the cure
peacemaker here you are no more.
