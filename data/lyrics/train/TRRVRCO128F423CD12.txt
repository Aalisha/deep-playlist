Well know that, I know this
That they'll want control of you
And hope that but notice
But you know they never do

And there are better days waiting for everyone
Slow starts, cold hearts will always be cold
Well they'll always be cold
Sat up, shut out
We know but you're never told

You can be grateful
You can be strong
We are not wrong
No one can love you
...
