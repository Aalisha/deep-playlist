This place feels so unfamiliar
And yet I know it well
I think I used to belong here
But the only way I can tell
Is that I miss you still
And I cannot find you here

Just like that sweet Spanish doll

And found that you were gone
(si nunca te fueras [if you never left])
You left no word no message
I still don't know exactly what went wrong
(lagrima [tear])
