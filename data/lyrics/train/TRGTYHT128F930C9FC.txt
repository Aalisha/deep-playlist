Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
For dignity

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
Would have got deeper, but there wasn't any need
I heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of man
