The stars conspired to bring me here, on a day like this;
The sun beats down upon my pride, like a wounded star.

What did you want from me?
Why did you bring me here?
I'm facing my foolish fate, oh

I'm too high, my curious Icarus wings melt from my skin.

Don't stand, don't stand so close to me,
I'll bring you down,
