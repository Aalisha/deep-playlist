Oh sweet mother mercy

Well, beggers can't be choosers
So I take what I can get
Love the life, girl I need
Yeah, I got no regrets

Listen up

And I just gotta say
There'll be hell to pay
Gonna be hell, hell to pay
It'll all come down on judgement day

When the hammer falls
When the hammer falls
When the hammer falls
When the hammer falls
That's it for you
...
