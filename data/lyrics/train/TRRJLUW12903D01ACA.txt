Break me
Cut me in two
Pain is carved in deeper
But I will get through
The insanity
I heard it all before
Picking up the pieces
That I spilled over you

We just obey
The silent code
I'm sick and tired
We're floating in the endless cloud

And I'll cry for you
And I'll smile for you
I can do what you want
I can be who you want me to be
...
