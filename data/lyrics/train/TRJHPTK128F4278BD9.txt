We meditate, we meditate to educate
Educate we meditate to elevate

(A-Plus)
Now it's the rhyme ripper fittin' to split ya
Spine to your liver
Flash like a line sniffer I'm swifter
Than Michael Jordan snortin' some speed
And I'll give ya
Much more than you need yo fly nigga
Scorin' the weed sticky green'll make me high quicker
Twistin' it and mixin' it with Bacardi lime liquor
Beligerent kickin' it with (tati on?) the time ticker
You could be a dyin' man with a mic but I'm sicker
You rhyme wack as I bust like Leon Isaac
Makin' peons slide back
That don't be on the right track, we way off
So now they stay soft like impotence
But I say naw, I'd rather stay raw
Magnificent rippin' it
Givin' it all I can though
Plus I handle devious scandals
MISCHIEVOUS COMMANDO!
Luchini like Camp Lo
Wreckin' the beats
Gettin embassy's executive cheese

(Phesto Dee)
I'm the loose cannon aid on deck
Detonate in a millisec
Covered in a blackened silloutte
And still reflects enough light
To shatter your body like a pinyata
Bobofet or
Jim Cata doin' lyrical kapoeta
The net to netta
Smokin' purple fibers off the hedges
Till it's resin
And pledge allegiance
To the essence
Confront Phes rock
