Hey
Can i talk to you for a min
theres somethin weighin heavy on my mind
you say aint nothin wrong
but your actions say differently

I love you
and you love me
now that we got that out the way
im gon say what i need to say

what you talkin bout?
where is all this comin from
sounds like you bout to start wit me again
oh my god here we go again

now see you took it there
(took it where)
i wasnt goin there
now ima bout to talk to you
about your messed up attitude

nine times outta ten
you aint about to say nothin
excuse me for being me
expressin myself
i shoulda stayed by myself

im tired of pretending like nothing is wrong
im tired of you sayin jus leave it alone
but i want another level, a commitment from you
im jus plain sick and tired
(im tired too)

oh what you tired of me cookin
being there for you
the problem is you ungrateful
...
