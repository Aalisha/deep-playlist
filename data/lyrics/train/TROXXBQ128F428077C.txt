Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la

Emily
And her love to be
Carved in a heart
On a berry tree
But it's only, only a little farewell love spell
Time to design a woman

Touch me
Oh wake me
Emily you ornament the earth
For me

Emily
You're the natural snow
The unstudied sea
You're a cameo
...
