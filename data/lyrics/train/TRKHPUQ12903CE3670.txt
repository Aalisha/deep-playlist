[ - Sample from "Sparrow" by Marvin Gaye] - w/ ad libs
I used to, singing, baby
Oh, around why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
(You-You good if you know me)
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
(You good if you know me)
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out, now, sing it on out
Let the world know what life's all about

Come on, (Statik Selektah), 'ology baby
What, uh

Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Anything you want to sing about, just
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
