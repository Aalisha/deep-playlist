Shine on, let the light of love grow stronger
(You've got to)
Shine on let the sun in my heart, a flame in the dark
So let the light of love shine on

I've been breathing such a long time
In the shadow of someone just like you
Hoping, looking for some sign
But in the minute I saw your face I knew
You are the answers to my mess
