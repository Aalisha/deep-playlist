Summon the servants
That are chained at the throat
By a tarnished chain only devoted
To their prosperous fathers
Fathers!

A grip so tight it bruises the neck
When the beast exhales
The horror's that settle internally
Galloping toward immoral intent
With the set of bounties
With the set of bounties
On the heads of the righteous
The dismantled bodies
Given back for validation and gratuity
To amuse the gods of fortune
The itching appetite
Grows as these hounds
Unearth the leaders and theive
On the lives of the weak beneath them
Beneath them!

Summon the servants
