Yeah, I know I look worse for the wear
But I have everything at my fingertips
I've been infantilized by a pat on the back and an endless go-ahead

Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down
Oh no, when there's no one disapproving

Yet it's women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden
Jesus Christ, I am forever making the same mistakes
Yet it's women not lack of ambition that keeps good men bedridden
Jesus Christ, I am forever making the same mistakes

I continue to stumble around as long as everyone cheers me on
