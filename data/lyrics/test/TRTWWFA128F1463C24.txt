The streets I left were always wet and grey
To half imagined west I made my way
To where the kettle always sings
And walking down the lane
Your long hair swings

You are the girl that waves at trains
In the cool September rain
You know I'll never live up to my dreams
The ones I spend with you
The way you wave a flower blooms
I won't pester or presume
I love you through the diesel fumes
I want to make my way with you
