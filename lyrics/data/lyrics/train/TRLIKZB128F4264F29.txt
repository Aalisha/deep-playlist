Well they shouldn't have played that good,
i got carried away and let the music,
go to my head.
well she shouldn't have worn that dress,
the way it curled around when she was spinnin',
just killed me dead.
my heart began to tell my body and my soul,
that it had gotten in the mood to lose control.
Oh no!
when did neon light turn into moon glow?
when did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
i'm about to give into this urge.
once more slow dance,
with her arms around me,
one more long glance,
and nothing will slow down me,
...
