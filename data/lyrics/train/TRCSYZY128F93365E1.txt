Once again I wake up alone on the wrong side of my bed
Once again you begin your dancing nakedly on the right side of my head
It's for a lack of better words that I can hardly speak my soul
And I'm feeling what I'm feeling what I'm feeling when it's time to lose control, my love

And once again we're off to war
But I can't agree with what we're fighting for
And that's not all because every time she smiles I see her soul
And I smile, what a wonderful life

It's true I used to try, but then I gave up
I learned it doesn't really matter, what I do ain't enough
To appease or to please, all my well-meaning deeds
Seem to all go up in smoke
