There's a girl inside tonight
Cause she's got nowhere to go
And her loves are running wild
Oh her loves are running wild yeah yeah yeah yeah

There's a girl inside tonight
Cause she's got nowhere to go
And her loves are running wild
Oh her loves are running wild
And there's a voice inside her head but it's told just
what to say (told just what to say)
Never loved you anyway
He's just a snake and you're the prey

He's got cash cash cash
He's made of money but
He's straight out the trash trash
He'll rip your heart out in a flash flash flash
Oh no you're not for sale

Cash cash cash he's made of money but
He's straight out the trash trash
...
