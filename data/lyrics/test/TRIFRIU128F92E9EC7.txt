Take these hands and lift them up
For I have not the strength
To praise You near enough
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

Take my voice and pour it out
And let it sing the songs of mercy
I have found
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

And all my soul needs
Is all Your love to cover me
