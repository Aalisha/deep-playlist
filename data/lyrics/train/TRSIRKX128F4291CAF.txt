I can't tolerate your sadness
Cause it's me you are drowning (you're downing me)
I won't allow (allow) any happiness
Cause everytime you laugh, I feel so... guilty
I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret
I've become the lie, beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
