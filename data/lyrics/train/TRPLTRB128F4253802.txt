Oh my god you came into my life
And turned my world around
I was lost I couldn't see my sight
So I couldn't find my home
So you know I've smoked some weed
And took some pills and even sniffed some blow
And so I repent
Cuz all the blessings I've received I know that heavens sent

I never knew when I spit this shit
That every rapper in the world be on some wicked shit
Its like the first time I hit this shit
Say you get the shit but wont admit the shit
You saw me shine the sun lit this shit
On my knees at night askin should I quit this shit
When i first started we were total opposites
I took a stand so you can see all the hypocrites

Salvation for all of my sins through Jesus sacrifices
We live in wicked nation
