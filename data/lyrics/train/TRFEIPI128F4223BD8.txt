No much I gained or break, it's those tiny little spots
Daily life that makes me forget my wounded heart
It doesn't matter when it may rain or it may shine
Glowing and reason months come back from time to time

No much I gained or break, it's those tiny little spots
Daily life that makes me forget my wounded heart
It doesn't matter when it may rain or it may shine
Glowing and reason months come back from time to time
