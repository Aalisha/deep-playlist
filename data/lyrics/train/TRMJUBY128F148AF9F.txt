Where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
That you were always giving
I don't know, I don't know
If it was ever there in the beginning

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Give it up, give it up, give it ip
