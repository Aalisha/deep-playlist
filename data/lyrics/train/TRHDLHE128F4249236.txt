Such tender eyes,
Such a sweet believer
The story never lies
When I found you girl
You were so far down
A black cat in disguise

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you've gone too far
Saving you soul for that one last kiss
Living you wish upon a star

Chorus:
Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
