Don't stay, run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay, run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay, run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay, run away
Tsarina has warned of the danger

It's your own fault
That is what we wanted
It's your own fault
This is where we lay

Don't stay, run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay, run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay, run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay, run away
Tsarina has warned of the danger
