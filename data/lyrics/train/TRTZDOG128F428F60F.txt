On the day that we left
The neighborhood heart skipped a beat
Oh the trees folded up and they shook as we drove down the street
I said to myself we're finally getting away,
When we come back I know that they'll all look the same

Now let's go to our city
And we'll change over night
We won't think about leaving
Oh why would we, it's too good a time

A hurricane hit
While we were missing
Oh, can anybody tell me where the damage is
...
