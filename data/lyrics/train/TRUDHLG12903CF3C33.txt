Streets full of madness
And I don't know where to turn
Driving me insane I have to get away
The one-eyed leads the blind to decay

Ohh... can't you keep away
Ohh...

A moment seems an eternity
A lifetime lived in a dream
Over and again but you know the end
Do you have the same dream like me?

And my spirit is free
I'm more than what you can see
I will make you believe
