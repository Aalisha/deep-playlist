(*talking*)
Yeah-yeah, the brat-bull huh
For real-for real, for real-for real

(Hook - 4x)
I'm bad news, (bad news)
I'm bad news, (he bad news)

(Big Tuck)
I'm bad news, to you motherf**king fakes
(it's the Hurricane Tuck), and I'm tearing up the state
Keep it real for my niggaz, but I'm in for them snakes
And they hate cause I'm great, and the mic's that I break
Money that I make, keep these broads in a daze
(and I rumble in the club), like I'm fresh out a cage
Put the lock on the K, so you best to behave
(you don't want it with me boy), cause I'm wild with this gauge

(Hook - 8x)
