Your body may be gone I'm gonna carry you in
In my head in my heart in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well I don't know I don't know I don't know don't think so

Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me
You get away from me

Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile
I had to think awhile

The ocean breathes salty won't you carry it in
In your head in your mouth in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
