Today Sucked
You knew it would
Yesterday and tommorow's
Not lookin' good
So wake up
With the sun
Go ahead and stare at it if you want
Leave me outside where i can't breathe


Today sucked
You knew it would
Whoa, Whoa
Today sucked
You knew it would
Yes you did
And tommorow's not lookin' good

It's too late
To take it back
Move forward don't live in the past
Take a deep breath
And let it out
Go ahead and tell me what this life's about
Leave me outside where I can't breathe
