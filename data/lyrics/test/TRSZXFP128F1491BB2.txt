I hear you screaming
But I know that you don't mean it
And it's all gone wrong now
 (Gotta gotta gotta take control, control
 Gotta gotta gotta take control)

I get the feeling that its gone
And it's the reason that
I feel so dark now
 (Gotta gotta gotta take control, control
 Gotta gotta gotta take control)

Too much inside, too much in life
Define your point of view
 (Gotta gotta gotta take control, control
 Gotta gotta gotta take control)

I know you're leaving
Though I think that my times fleeting
But yet you don't see it

Gone, once you shone, I move on
...
