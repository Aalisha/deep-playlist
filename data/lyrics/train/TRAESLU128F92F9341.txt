[Verse 1: J-Love]
Yeah, uh, yo
Let me spark this
I'm already wound up
Let's burn it from the ground up
Turn the fuckin' sound up
Allow drunks spittin' on this underground cut
Come around
It's goin' down like the town slut
Keep your mouth shut
I'm quick to set it
Kid forgot it
I get gas then piss unleaded
Your shits pathetic
Slip before your wigs beheaded
Disconnected and ripped apart like a Christmas present
Flip this record
We can battle on the instrumental
Battle to a quicker tempo
Battle with a pen and pencil
Your girls digits in my pocket
That's coincidental
But if they had a pimp Olympics I would win a medal
I've been a rebel for the most of my life
I go to your show with a knife, start provoking a fight
Jump on stage just when the moment is right
And scream "open the mic"
Your opponent gets sliced
[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Out the mouth comes fire
Who ignite the fullest?
Celph Titled feed you lead, make you bite the bullet
Talk imaginary crime stories and get dealt shots
Surprise you with the Kalico and get shell shocked
And Hells hot
You don't wanna get caught there
When it's warfare we suit up and carry fours in pairs
I'll rob a bitch a too
