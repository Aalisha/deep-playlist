Older than Kosciusko
Darwin down to Alice Springs
Dealers in the clearing house
The settlements explode

High up in the homelands
Miners drive across the land
Encounter no resistance
When the people block the road

Older than Kosciusko
Dry white seasons years ago
Darkness over Charleville
The fires begin to grow

No end to the hostility
Now they wanna be somewhere else
No stranger to brutality
...
