Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside

Well there's lots of smart ideas
In books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me
I wish to hell I had

Get up! Get up!
Turn the ignition
Get up! Get up!
Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say: “all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice”
