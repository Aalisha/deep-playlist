Farewell to the groves of shillelagh and shamrock
Farewell to the wee girls of old Ireland all 'round
May their hearts be as merry as ever I would wish them
When far, far away across the ocean I'm bound

Oh my father is old, and my mother is quite feeble
To leave their own country, it grieves their heart sore
Oh the tears in great drops down their cheeks, they are rolling
To think they must die upon some foreign shore

But what matters to me where my bones may be buried
If in peace and contentment I can spend my life
Oh the green fields of Canada, they daily are blooming
...
