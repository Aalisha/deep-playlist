You say I'm the one to set you free 
But still you don't open up your door 
You say my love is the remedy 
Can't you admit that it's secure 
Why can't you say you're afraid 
But so am I, but it's all right 
It's all right 

Stay with me, lay with me 
Lean on me, call on me 
Run with me, dream with me 
Pray with me, fall on me 
Whenever you need me 
I'll be by your side 
As sure as the sun's gonna rise 
...
