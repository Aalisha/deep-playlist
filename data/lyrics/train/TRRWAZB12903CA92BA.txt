My love of life just gets stronger
As the days go by
Somethings I wish, they would last
Just a little bit longer
As the days go by

Somethings don't look to me
Like they used to be, no

As the days go by, I get a little closer to
As the days go by, a little bit closer to you
As the days go by, I get a little closer
I'm coming back to you
