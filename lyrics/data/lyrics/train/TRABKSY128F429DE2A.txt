It only takes a minute
yeah a minute or two
just like stubbin your toe
or slammin the door on your finger
pull out the stinger
then move on to
the next little drama queen
and go and get some sleep, dream

yeah lay your head back and dream
about a girl you had
that broke your broken heart
the one that said shed love you
from the start

and when the nightmares over
come and thank her for

all the memories
injuries
flowered sheets
and hypocracies
all the picture frames
the carpet stains
...
