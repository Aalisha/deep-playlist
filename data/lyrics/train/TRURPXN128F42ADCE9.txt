I have heard about the days of old
About the men who followed You
And how they saw the Supernatural
And became the chosen few

So I come before You now
Tearing off my earthly crowns
for this one thing I have Found

I want a faith like that
To see the dead rise
or to see You pass by
Oh I, I want a faith like that
Whatever the cost
I'll suffer the loss, Oh I
I want faith like that
...
