Just so happens that I'm still all alone
Know that I've turned you down before
But I won't turn you down no more, baby

If you check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more

If you wanna check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more
