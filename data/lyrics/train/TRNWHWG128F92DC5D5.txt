Feel the pressure, let it go
Feel the pressure, let it go

You try to buy some time
Can't read the signs or the reasons why
Every single time I could drive in blind
Can't make up my mind
I know I'm gonna find my way out

Crash you're going down without a sound
And I'll pass you up before I explode
Breaking until I'll see it through
You won't keep me down when I crash through you

So here we are right now
This is our time to cross this line
Every single time I could drive in blind
