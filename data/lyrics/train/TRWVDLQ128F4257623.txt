My family just couldn¹t wait, I should have seen it coming
What a nice conspiracy, what a nice surprise
But now it¹s all too late
I am six feet under, It¹s so very hard to breathe
My family they put me here, in a coffin made of glass
So I can see them in their glory or they can see me in my misery
They¹re standing all around my grave
Six feet under, I¹m in a coffin made of glass
...
