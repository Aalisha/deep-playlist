tar me, feather me and push me around, punish me and correct me,
kick me when I'm down crucify me and stone me, hang me out to die
well light the fire and burn me, all because of a lie

all these years you have taken away, you don't wanna listen,
don't care what I say, you're making a mistake

ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I'm tired of doing the time
I shall return, then you will learn, vengeance will be mine
