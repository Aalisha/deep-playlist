Me and my old man
Don't see eye to eye
We take our walks outside
Underneath the birch trees

He said I think it's gonna freeze this year
I said I gotta get away from here
Me and my old man
Me and my old man

Should have been enough to know
That you'd let us all down
Could have been enough to try
Without making a sound
It's all part of the plan my dear
It's all part of the plan my dear
