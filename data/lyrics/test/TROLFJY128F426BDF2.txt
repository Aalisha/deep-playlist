Watch the Holy war
Armies by the score
Is this all that we deserve
Look around and see
All the killing fields
Like a lesson we must learn

All the misery - Hand of God
Violence and disease - Hand of God
Population losing faith
Devastating crime - Hand of God
No respect for life - Hand of God
Challenges that we must face - by the Hand of God

Desolate angels
Ride tsunami swells
