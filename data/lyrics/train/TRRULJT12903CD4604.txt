You don't hug and kiss me anymore
I want you in stitches on the floor
Woo me once twice and don't do it again
Expert advice says it's all in the men

Won't you love me again

Anxious, uptight, low track, one self mind
Take this, take that, take it all of the time
Woo me once twice and don't do it again
