Take my eyes, take them aside
Take my face, and desecrate
My arms and legs
They get in the way

And take my hands, they'll understand
Take my heart, pull it apart
And take my brain, or what remains
And throw it all away
'Cos I've grown tired of this body
A cumbersome and heavy body

Take my lungs, take them and run
Take my tongue, go have some fun
And take the ears, take them and disappear
Take my joints, take them for points
Take my teeth, tear through my cheeks
And take the nose go and dispose
...
