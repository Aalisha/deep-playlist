(Verse 1)
When I think of what I've done
All the pain that I brung
Baby, you should have walked out on me
And when I turned away from you
Whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me?

And it's no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgive me like it was so easy
I should have been better ta you

(Chorus)
Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that loving me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
I'm thankful just being your girl
