Face against the ground
Torn, but you can stand
Your will is strong, but you have now
I know you can save us

Faith is on your side
Fears you can't deny
It's burned a hole, right through your soul
But I know you can save us
Save us now

Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
Don't wave goodbye
But nothing can brake us
Don't say goodbye
I know you can save us
You can bring us back again
