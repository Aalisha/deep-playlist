Every perception is what you perceive, all that you know you were taught to believe
Something is stirring and something is cracked, there is no hope as you limp your way back
Pushing and pulling you rip at the seams, working through problems set deep in your dreams

Know this, just incase you don't notice
I've had a rough time so far
The symptoms are slowly growing, show yourself for what you are
