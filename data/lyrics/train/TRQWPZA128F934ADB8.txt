When far futures calling and your needs at hand
I'll be your creation, with you I'm hand in hand
Since my automation I've learned to think for man
Now you're not able to shut down my master plan

Once you'd crowd around me, marvel young and old
our machine brings us peace, now we are one and bold
Who'd think that perhaps
your trust would soon collapse?
Life and death as a whole under machines control

(Pre)
Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies
