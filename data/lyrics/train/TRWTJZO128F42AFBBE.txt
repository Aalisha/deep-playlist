What can I do? What can I say?
To make you want me more
To have your love and show you how
That's all I'm asking for

I've been around the block so many times
And I need a place to stop
I only want what's right for you
And you could be right for us

I hear the same thing all the time
And you know that I don't care
Well, I don't like the way you're hanging around
And I sure don't like your hair

Ooh, ooh
Why won't you give me your love?
Ooh, ooh
Why won't you give me your love?

I'll chain you up, I'll make you mine
