You can call me day and night, night and day
Girl, you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
We go together like a potter and clay
Girl, you're all that I want
I need you up around my way

Michael Angelo would faint
Rembrandt would cry
To stand in line for a lock of your hair
I'd fly around around the world
Just to be close to you
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

Now looking in your eyes
I see the real reason
Why stars like to fall from the sky
You're all I ever think of
That's why, I gotta let you know
How you blow my mind
You're just my type, just my kind

You can call me day and night, night and day
Girl, you're all that I want
I need you up around my way
