Love me my love
Hold me my love
Kiss my red rose
Give breath to my lips
Give fire to burn me my sun...
My burning sin
Shedding my skin
Ending my life
My life in your hands
A candlelight's death in the wind...

My angel eyes in my dream lies
Our pure love
My angel fly take me high in your wings to the sky...

Naked I'll stand
Before the end
Push me to fall
Naked in your dream
...
