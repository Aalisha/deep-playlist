From daylight till dusk, we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Well, I can't forget yes, I remember yet
The way my daddy looked at me and cried

"Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin'
Hurry up son be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow, take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all"
