Well, if the whiskey doesn't get me, I know the memories will
'Cause you left a hole in my heart, that's too deep to fill
But a drink or two, maybe three or four, for a while you're out of sight
It's a headache tomorrow, or a heartache tonight.

The sun goes down, the blues come around and the choice is black and white
Low down and lonesome and high as a kite
When you can't win for losing, you know it's just not right
