Jane, I've made it plain,
Although I'm faded as a ghost
I want you here inside me,
Say the word.
Oh, you've been playing nice,
But I can see it in your eyes
You're thinking, "Christ,
He's everybody's girl."

You can't spend the night...

Jane, I've seen you at the club
You were tearin' up the rug
With no regard for form,
You're such a brute!
You had a ready elbow
For the girls you hate or just don't know.
You head-butt me,
Cos you thought it was cute.

You can't spend the night...
Yes, I'm sure you're right
You can't spend the night...
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
...
