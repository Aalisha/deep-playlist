(Attention please Southbound bus loading Gate No 8
All aboard for Willow Springs Taboule Rogersville Paskanaw Ravanden
Belaford Johnsborro Marktree and Memphis all aboard South all aboard please)
I drive for the bus line to all points south I drive
Guess I've heard a million stories from the folks that ride
Have your tickets ready please and don't forget to check your grid
And I'm a leavin' on another one of my hurried southern trips
These big wheels roll in the heat and the cold
When the thunder and the lightenin' whips
And the folks that ride got a reason to ride on a hurried southern trips
