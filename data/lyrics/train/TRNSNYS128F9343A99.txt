Uh

Is that that new thing, Joe?
It better be. Huh?
Talk to me, chief
It that it, Joe?
Well, that's cool though, haha
Alright

Sometime you gotta roll with it up front
Some things are better left in a closet
Some thing, just lay it on the table
Sometime gotta stop, gotta pause it

Yeah, yeah

Well, she used to wake me up for breakfast
Force feed me with a silver spoon
Even do me when I'm dirty
We let it roll till way past noon, wooh
