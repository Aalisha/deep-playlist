Revelation
Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)
You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
I know! that deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide the secret
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine!

Give me just one night, una noche!
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche!
I'll give you the time of your life!
(the time of you life, ooooh)
(I'll give you the time of your life)
(oooh baby yeah!)

Your eyes of passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
