My folks own the land round here
And our big old house now for some fifty odd years
We'd all seen a few rough days
But I never dreamed I'd watch it all get swept away

No one knows what causes angry rain
The water rushed right through this town just like a great big train
Years of hard work and memories
Are floatin' down big river on their way out to sea.

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood
I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home
Where I grew up
Life goes on
After the flood

The Clover Inn Bar was hit pretty hard
The piano's lyin' in the street broken apart
...
