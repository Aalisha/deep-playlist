Oh I ain't joking when I'm telling ya
That while in the Yakima
Digging up them thunderegg stones
Well, we cracked them wide open
The mountain started smoking
And the sky turned the color of a crow

Oooohhh, oooohhhh

Fires in the northlands
Floods to the south
Put the pedal to the metal
And let it all hang out
(Go-go, go-go)
Fires in the northlands
(Go-go, go-go)
Floods to the south
(Go-go, go-go)
Put the pedal to the metal
(Go-go, go-go)
And let it all hang out

The ash turned to confetti
ALLELUIA!
Outside them great tri-cities
ALLELUIA!
Oh, God showed his great mercy
ALLELUIA!
