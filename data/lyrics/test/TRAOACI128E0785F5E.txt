You were all that I wanted
I fell in love with all of your heart and your soul
From that moment, couldn't imagine
You ever hurting me or mistreating my love
I should have known

Rivers of tear drops
These sharp pains in my heart
If This was the way that you love
You never should have loved me

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have,
Never should have told me you loved me and you would never leave me.
'Cause everything that you would do
It made me fall in love with you
Until your left and you made that mistake
