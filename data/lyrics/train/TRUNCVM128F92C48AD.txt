Walk softly, don't want to disturb the dead
Is it an enemy in front of me, or have I been mislead
Should I stay of fold, I think I'll pack my shit and go
I've always been the wait around type, underground,
Nothing more than a friend

Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same
Wear these clothes, walk this way, do exactly what they say
It's your life, but they're way, follow me it's all the same

So count your chips and roll the dice you might find
It's twice as nice, around and around again, get in where you fit in
I know it's quite deceiving when I look but I don't see me,
Around and around again, get in where you fit in
