I am just a girl
Who thinks this life we lead
Our destiny we follow
One half of the world's asleep
One half's awake
That's all it takes to follow
The sun that rises up
Is also setting too
So make the most of it
Before it sets on you
Don't follow don't follow
Follow through
Even it's just this once
Follow through
I am just a girl
With thoughts unchained
