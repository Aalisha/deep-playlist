I see the lights are turning
And I look outside the stars are burning
Through this changing time
It could have been anything we want
It's fine salvation was just a passing thought
It was just a passing thought.

Don't wait act now
This amazing offer won't last long
It's only a chance to pave the path we're on
I know there are more exciting things to talk about
And in time we'll sort it out.

And though they say it's possible to me
I don't see how it's probable
I see the course we're on
Spinning farther from what I know
I'll hold on
Tell me that you won't let go
Tell me that you won't let go.
