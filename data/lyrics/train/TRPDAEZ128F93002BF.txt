(Chorus)
Man dem down a TG doh got no head (head fly way)
Man dem down a Jungle doh got no head (me head hurt me)
Man dem down a Down Kirk doh got no head (head mad)
Man dem from Panish down doh got no head

Bruk yuh tank kill yuh fish yuh poodle dog dead
Nuh fuck wid we! Twin tower drop inna we head
All when you a sleep me and me fren light yuh bed
Nuh fuck wid we! Twin tower drop inna we head
Bush mouth man ready fi run di place red
Nuh fuck wid we! Twin tower drop inna we head
Neck drop off suh me stitch it wid needle and thread
Nuh fuck wid we! Twin tower drop inna we head

(Verse one)
Head drop off and a roll
Walter boy a kick me head up inna Arnet goal
Sabina Park watch as mi head a goal
We nuh tek check from rat foot nah patrol
Dem man yah nah no head so dem nuh worry bout cold
Mek me tell yuh di half that have never been told
Panish town man cold like di north pole
Nah big up no shotta wey a grab no bill fold
Pan di ground we head a roll
