Uh
Somebody
Uh
Need some helpa!
Get it
Somebody

I don't know how long I can stand for this
Workin' my fingers to the bone and don't get shit(huh)
Strugglin' to pay the rent
Got my check, all the money spent
Now, I got the feelin' this ain't no accident

The rich keep gettin' richer
And the poor just stay the same
They don't wanna hear what we gotta say
But we gon' say it anyway

[Chorus:]
Don't take too much (Too much)
Gon' weigh ya down
Don't take (Too Much)
Gon' take you down
You know we could have (So Much)
