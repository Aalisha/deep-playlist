And I'm alright standing in the streetlights here
Is this meant for me? My time on the outside is over
We don't know how you're spending all of your days
Knowing that love isn't here
You see the pictures but you don't know their names
'Cause love isn't here

And I can't do this by myself
All of these problems, they're all in your head
And I can't be somebody else
You took something perfect and painted it red

No sympathy when shouting out is all you know
