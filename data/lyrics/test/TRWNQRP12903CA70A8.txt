One of these days I'm gonna fly
Over the mountain
One of these days I'm gonna ride
On the silver lining
One of these days I'm gonna witness
All I've been missing
One of these days

One of these days I'm gonna do
All the things that I've never done
I'm gonna finish all the races
That I've run but I've never won
And I'm gonna see a million faces
And recognize everyone
One of these days

(Chorus)
One of these days
I'm gonna see the hand
That took the nails for me
One of these days
I'm gonna hold the key
To the mansion built for me
One of these days
I'm gonna walk the streets of gold
