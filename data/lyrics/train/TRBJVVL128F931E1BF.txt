Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
(Yeah)

Count backwards 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Before you get too heated and turned on
(This guy)
You should've learned your lesson all in times before
You've been bruised, you've been broken

And there's my mind saying, "Think before you go"
Through that door that takes me to nowhere
(Yes boy)
I stopped you all romantic crazy in your head
Do you think I listen? No, I don't care

'Cause I can't focus, I can't stop
You got me spinning round, round, round, round
(Like a record)
I can't focus, it's too hot
(Inside)
You'll never get to Heaven
If you're scared of getting high

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
hen this girl wants to rock with you
 (Yeah)

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
