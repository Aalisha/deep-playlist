Baby i know why you want to let me go
All because i been treatin' you so bad
Don't say goodbye, i didn't mean to make you cry
I'm in love with you cuz you're the best that i ever had
Bridge:
Just one more night
Just give me one more night
Just make it right
I promise i will make it feel alright
Just one more chance
All i need from you is one more chance
To fill your life with a little bit of romance
Just give me...

Chorus:
One more night to show it will
It will be alright
One more night with you i know

Please give me a chance to prove myself to you
(all right)
Girl that's all i want to do, baby (all right)
Don't say that it's too late
...
