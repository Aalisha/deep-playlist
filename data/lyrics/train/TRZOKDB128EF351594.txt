Oh girl, just tell me
What you are dealing with, I wanna know
Oh girl, just tell me what you are dealing with
I wanna know, I wanna know
Oh girl, I want to know, oh yes

Each other at the bus stop after school

As if I'm fool, as if I'm fool
Oh yes, as if I'm fool, oh yes

If you're looking for someone to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
