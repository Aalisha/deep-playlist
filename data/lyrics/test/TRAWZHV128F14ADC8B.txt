I've waited my whole life for this
To stand here face to face with you
All my failures, fears and doubts
Have all been taken away

Remember when I waited up
Through the night just to hear you
To hear you call my name
Just the sound of your voice
Took all of my heartache away
Taken away

I think of all the time I missed
Never knowing about you
But then your grace could take away
My regrets, my insecurities
