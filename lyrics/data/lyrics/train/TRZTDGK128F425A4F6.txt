Are you certain
What you saw is what you tell
'Cos it's sure is hot as hell
Is it true what they say
Then I must pass it on
'Cos we sure want everyone to know

Talk about it
I'm a patient listener
And I sure want to hear it all
Let it flow
I must pass it on
'Cos we sure want everyone to know

Get up
It's a bad night Dad
We can't see light of the moon
Get up
Can't we do it tomorrow
It's bad night, Dad
Can't you hear the rain on the window pain
Get up
Can't we do it tomorrow
