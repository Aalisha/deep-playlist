Closed in around me
The walls are like enemies
Trying to trap me inside
You are the same with your devious inklings
Trying to take me for mine

Well I don't know what you want from me
I've given you everything
Even the air I breathe
And I don't know what you're trying to prove
I've got nothing left to lose
Either way
I know I'm only

Giving away the guilt in me
Giving away complicity
The feeling is surreal (but the blood's still on my hands)
Giving away the guilt in me
...
