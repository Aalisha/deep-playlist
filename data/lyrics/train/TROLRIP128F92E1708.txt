Night falls down and soon we're all alone
What do you have in mind, guidance of the blind, I feel lost
Lost inside this maze of shame and sin
A taste of sweetest wine, addictive yet so fine, I want more
The conscience says no, all senses yell go
There's too much at stake this time
The more I deny, the more I commit to this night

Don't tell me what you feel, don't tell me what you see
Close your eyes and stay behind the scene
Any alibi will be one step over the line
