It started all in early September
When my godgiven little became a lot older
Goodbyes seal my broken heart
Hold on to your teardrops, you got a long way to go

Did you get older doing nothing today?
Don't you wanna stop complaining?
If one is easy then hard is two
No one knows where you're heading to
Once my private collection, always betting on you

No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
Cut off your hairâ€”yeah that's it!
