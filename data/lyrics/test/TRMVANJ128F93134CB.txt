This is a story about a small but strong and proud man
Who woke up one morning and looked at the ceiling of his bedroom
And said to himself, "What I love in this world, in this life
Is God, my farm and my family."

And on his farm he had some cows, he had some cows, he had some cows
He had some chickens, he had ducks, he had some very small barking dogs
Little tiny one-inch-long dogs that had red stripes all over them
And they lived mostly on the farmer's shoulder and when he woke up in the morning
They'd go, "Hello, good morning, hi, how are you, good morning, hey."
And he had a dog and he also had the strange and unusual beast called the yak

And one day and verily as the man was surveying the beauty of his land
Of his home, of the place where he lived, he said, with a smile on his face
He said to himself, "My life has been good to me."
And all the animals on the farm went, "Yes."
And he walked down off the porch and he noticed that a rake was facing the wrong way up
