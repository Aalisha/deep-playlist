Step we gaily on we go,
Heel for heel
And toe for toe,
Arm and arm
And row and row,
All for Marie's wedding.

Over hillways, up and down,
Myrtle green and bracken brown,
Past the sheilings through the town
All for the sake of Marie.

Step we gaily on we go,
Heel for heel
And toe for toe,
Arm and arm
And row and row,
All for Marie's wedding.
