If you feel love's an illusion
I won't hold you down
Do you feel lost in confusion
No hope to be found

Stop before you start believin'
That all our hope is gone
'Cause I know that there's a reason
Why we're holdin' on

And when you walked into my life I realized
Oh no one else took me by surprise

(I believe)
I believe you
(Want it too)
Oh you want it
(You'll know the way)
Know the way
Yes the way I feel and I care
(Someday)
Oh yes I care
(Know the truth)
