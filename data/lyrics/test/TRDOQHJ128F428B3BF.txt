How you gonna let that girl get between us baby?
Do you even know her name?
How am I supposed to make it through to you?

Is Sunday gonna be my day to take it easy
Make it all about me
Maybe on Monday think about callin'
Maybe Tuesday we'll see how I feel
Sunday gonna be my day to take it easy
And make it all about me
Maybe on Monday think about callin'
Maybe Tuesday we'll see how I feel

It's 9: 30 in the mornin', I didn't sleep well again
Tossed all night long boy
Can't stand it when we fight like this
Here we go again so I have to be gone

Can't deal with the fallout gonna take a time out
I need to take the day off
Gonna gather my thoughts, gather myself
I need some time without you, without you

Is Sunday gonna be my day to take it easy
Make it all about me
