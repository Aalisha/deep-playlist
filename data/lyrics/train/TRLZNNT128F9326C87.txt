Heavy thoughts seem to slip away
When you were here on my darkest days
I trust in you
Many debts I cannot repay
Too many clouds in my sky today
I trust in you

As if it really matters
You run

When I reach out for a hand to
Pull me through the storm
Pull me through the norm
I reach for you

Broken glass as the evening fades
Take another drink as the evening fades
I trust in you
