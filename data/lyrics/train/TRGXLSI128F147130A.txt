I'm on a mission
To see what's been missing
My favorite song is on repeat
But it's just not helping me
My eyes have been wider but never been brighter
Something else is going on
I need a reminder of why I feel this way

There's a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that I've been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I'm pretending it's alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life

Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life

I still believe in
