Sunrise I greet you, the beauty of your light
So warm and tender was never the night
In tears I see you, the last time it will be
So give me your blessing, I'll meet my destiny
No rest for the Sinner
Hypnos refused me my sleep
This was the last night of my life
With wine I pondered on my deeds
I drank to the devil with servants
It's good with a friend where you go
No one would share my last chalice
So I drink to the ones that I know

Ring brother, ring for me
Ring the bells of hope and faith
Ring for my damnation
