[chorus]
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby,
It's goin down,
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby,
It's goin down

I be that nigga bringing fat funk freestyle perspectives
Rappers couldn't see me, they hide it fucking detectives
Check this when I flex this, put it on point
That nigga Skillz droping foucers in your local due joint
Im still paying deuce and saying cruise
Still geting up at niggaz asses
like that little brothers Underudce
Shoes haotatin' in ya air, it aint news I stay on bitches
like Dano Kariges
At partys I retaits and make niggaz wanna fight
So when they play some reggae keep happerseein' to the right
Rigth outta my life you and ya hoddie bitch
Seein' thous of body, whitin no infron of me
V.A running shit, you best be believe it
If Im up and commin, all ya niggaz is down and leavin'
Hit me with a tound when I come to ya town
When you see my face, you know it's about to go down

[chorus]
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby,
It's goin down,
It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby, It's goin down baby,
It's goin down
