Take a gun out of the closet, put it on next while aboard it
Come stand in front of me and let me see
Take a one smile that you wear
And place it on these lips that's burning
To share this fire you've built inside of me.

Turn the light down in the bedroom,
Put the sheet down from the pillow
When we're like this love's easy understood
...
