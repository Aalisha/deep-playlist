I'm lost at sea, the radio is jammed, but they won't find me
I swear it's for the best, and then your frequency is pulling Me in closer til I'm home
And I've been up for days, I finally lost my mind,
And then I lost my way, I'm blistered but im better
And I'm home

I will crawl, theres things that are worth giving up I know, but I wont let this get me
I will fight, you live the life your given with the storms outside
And somedays all I do is watch the sky

This room's too small, it's only getting smaller, I'm against the wall
...
