Just let me know...
It's strictly physical...

Dirtier dancing alone, so physical (so physical)
Feels like a fire, daddy even you know
We're getting close to borders, so over ago
The way you're watching me baby tells me
You're feeling my flow

So if you want it
Just let me know

If you want it
Just let it go
If you need it, boy
it's strictly physical

If you want
Just let me know
If you got it cause
It's strictly physical

It's strictly physical
It's strictly
...
