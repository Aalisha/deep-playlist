Jackie by Bossa NostraJackie has a thing
Even if the thing is not so hard
She knows right now it's all she's got
And she can make it swing
Jackie has a past
Even if she's trying to forget
Between the stage lights and the threat
Oh she will blow the past away
La la la la la
Life is just a lonely night of sad rain
