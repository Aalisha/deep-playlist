I'd give a 21 gun shot salute...
With the toy rifle that you bought me, but it won't shoot.

And all is well, because there's been one too many shots.
The sterile robots want to talk to me about detox.

Stop the presses. There's been an update via 1: 30 AM phone call.
When an only half-informative source talks discretely...

Meet me... at the family room on the side of the intensive care unit.
Immediately... I'll carry a tune, but the siren's so loud I can't hear my music.
Keep free... of negative thoughts. Everything'll be fine we all assumed.
That is would go back to the way things were. That it would go back to normal soon.
...
