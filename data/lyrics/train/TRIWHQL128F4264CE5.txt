I was born down in Dallas
Raised up in the city of wind
Spent a month of Sundays
Talkin' about the places I have been
Played the blues in England
I played 'em for the queen
The queen did love my style
But the queen is not my thing
Goin' back to Dallas
Livin' in the palace of the king
Couldn't play it Moscow
You know that it was way too cold
