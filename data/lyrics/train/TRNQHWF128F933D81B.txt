Now love is comin' through the window comin' in the door
And I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceiling up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love

All of my life my heart's been walked on
Women said to love me and my how they talked on
Tellin' me lies and fillin' my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold to myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin' to pull a wool over my eyes
...
