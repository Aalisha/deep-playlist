I'm bound to hang the full of the moon
one drunk mistake and I'm pinned as the fool
with your silver pistol, crossed my eyes
found it simple to get what you want, but what do you need?

Julianna, got this feeling
that you're leaving
when I need you most
'cause I'm stranded
on a shipwreck
now I'm sinking
I'll keep holding on to one more day

we passed the mark of no return
...
