You're on my mind, living in my soul
a moment in time move it and let it go
the air we breathe smells like love
your melody makes me sing the sweetest song
your energy is heaven

and I just can't believe that
you've been sent to me from above
you're my angel love
and I can't wait to feel your
sun shine down on me from above
angel love
...
