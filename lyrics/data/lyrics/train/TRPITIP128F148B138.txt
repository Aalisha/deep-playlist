You are a walking contradiction
You speak with false intentions
but I know what you really want from me

You're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and
you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand this

Take your insecurities out on me while I destroy you
realize that you should never test me

You're gonna make me flip this switch
...
