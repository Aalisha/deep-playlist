There's not enough hours in my day
To tell you that you're getting in the way
There's not enough words in my book
To explain how I got over you

I feel all cramped up now
Trapped in this single bed
Concrete thoughts of you
Weighing down my head
Sleeping with my nemesis
Scattered on the quilt
My hand is always down my pants
Guilt guilt guilt

Do you think it's the right time
