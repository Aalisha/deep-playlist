It's the same old song and dance,
You're askin' me for a second chance.
I don't care, baby, what you say,
All I wanna do is gotta get away.

Been too many times callin' out your name,
You promised me, but you never came.
Was it, baby, all a game to you? Yeah.
After all the things that I've done for you,
Say your love, your love, could not be true.
I don't need nobody like you.

Chorus:
So turn out the lights, the party's over.
Turn out the lights, the party's over for you.
This time is the last time, never be a next time.
