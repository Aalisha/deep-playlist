There I was, ten years old
Waiting in my room for him to come home
I just knew he'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad

There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said

In the sunlight or the rain
Brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way

Whatever road you may be on
No, you're never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you'll always be my baby
