They say that freedom is something you make
Independence, some sort of change
Happiness, a smile, and a fleeting look
Who appears inside the soul i strew so with love?

Here i am okay, okay
There i go alone, easy
Here i am to stay, thank you
There i go alone

A cat purrs to prove that she's still a cat
