Got The Blues (tk.1), Blind Lemon Jefferson . . . . March 1926
(G position, F# pitch)

Well the blues come to Texas loping like a mule
I said the blues come to Texas loping like a mule
You take a high brown woman, man, she is hard to fool

You can't ever tell what a woman's got on her mind
Man, you can't tell what a woman's got on her mind
You might think she's crazy about you, she's leavin' you all the time
