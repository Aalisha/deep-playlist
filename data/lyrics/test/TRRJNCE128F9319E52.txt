I made some decisions
Detrimental to my life
Put my trust in some translucent people
But now I see through them just fine
I've come back to the real world
And put my bitterness behind
Cuz revenge is not as sweet as my freedom
And no one's taking mine

(Chorus)
Promises broken
With endless waiting
Been so many mountains
