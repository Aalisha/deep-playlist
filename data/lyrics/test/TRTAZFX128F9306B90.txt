Have you ever wondered why you sometimes see me smile?
It's to tell you that i care.
And the best thing you can do is come and follow through

Just to hold me
Just be there.

I'm falling in love
I can't help myself.
You're making it clear that i need no one else.
The state of the heart that just won't give in

Right here's where we start
'cause you send me.

Round and around and around round

Round and around and around round -
That's what you do

Round and around and around round -
I'm falling for you
