1st verse:
Let me tell you 'bout this girl
Maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See we be makin' love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgandy

The way that we kiss is unlike any other way that
I be kissin' what I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen

Brown Sugar babe
I gets high off you love
i don't know how to behave

Chorus:
I want some of your Brown Sugar
