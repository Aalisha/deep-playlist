I am not an ill-willed person
I do not wish bad things for you
Love the faces you've been dreaming of
Embrace memory

Wear your coat, sing your song
But don't write me, we'll never really get along
You see, there's just too much I know already

Love everything you've always loved
Love everything you've always loved
Love everything you've always loved
Love everything you've always loved

Your long black hair and entourage
Of fans who care can't camouflage
...
