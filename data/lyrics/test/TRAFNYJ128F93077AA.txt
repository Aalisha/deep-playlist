We have to lean on eachother for succes in this
We have to trust, that there`s a reason for doing this
`Cause everything else but us is falling apart

I know the way to all of the exits
But I`d rather stay in my seat than leaving it
`Cause everything else but us is falling apart

And when the plane starts stalling
We`ll be forced to use our wings
And when the chutes won`t open
We`ll be forced to use our wings

In a way I know we can make it
At the end of the day there is no way to fake it
`Cause everything else but us is falling apart
