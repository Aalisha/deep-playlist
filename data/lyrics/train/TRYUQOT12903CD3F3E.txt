Cut, cut the, cut, cut the mic range...

In, in the mix.

Everytime I think of you,
It always seems I do,
Everytime I have you,
I thought you'd understood.

Everytime I think of you,
It always seems I do,
Everytime I have you,
I thought you'd understood.

Everytime I think of you,
It always seems I do,
Everytime I have you,
I thought you'd understood.
