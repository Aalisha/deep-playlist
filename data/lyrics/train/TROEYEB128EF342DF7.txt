I would take the ocean in an orange crate
And I'd do it in one day too.
I can build a railway track,
Just to take us back to the places we once knew.
Coz I'm sure you'd like that.

I would be a criminal to steal the Mona Lisa
And I wouldn't leave a clue.
Then I'd climb the Eiffel Tower,
Maybe higher, could swim the deepest sea.
And it wouldn't bother me.
