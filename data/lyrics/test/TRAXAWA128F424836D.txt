If you've done nothing wrong
you've got nothing to fear
If you've something to hide
you shouldn't even be here

Long live us
the persuaded we
integral
collectively
to the whole project
it's brand new
conceived solely
to protect you

One world
One reason
Unchanging
One season

If you've done nothing wrong
you've got nothing to fear
If you've something to hide
you shouldn't even be here
You've had your chance
...
