I made you
And your hate to
Socialize in a matter
That suits me fine
So while I breathe in
You punched my teeth in
I tried to explain it but
You just dont, just don't see

I, I see right through you

So you do things
Mainly bad things
Is it to satisfy
Your own neurotic needs
I got this feeling
I'm just dreaming
But just make sure
I'm awake when you punish me

Come follow me
To that place where
We both see
What happened to you
I need to see if it's all true
Confide in me
