I'm a little lady
treat me like a baby
I've been waiting wakely
for someone like you

Can you share my passion
earning my obsession
I want satisfaction
all of the time

if you wanna taste me
try my paradise
come, and feel up my desire

you can please me,
tease me,
take me to the sky,
baby, we can burn like fire

I am your holy virgin,
be gentle all the time
I am your holy virgin,
I'll blow your mind

I am your holy virgin
and if you touch me right
I'll be your nasty virgin

I can take you places
show you all my faces
...
