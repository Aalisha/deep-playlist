B.B. King
Miscellaneous
Tired Of Your Jive (from Blues Is King)
You're sittin' there lookin' proud
Thinkin' you're so fine
Tryin' to run around
With every friend of mine
Think you're so smart baby
Think that i'm a fool
Yeah, i'm gonna tell you baby
You'd better play it cool

I'm tired of your jive
Yeah baby i'm tired of your jive
I refuse to be your fool mama
