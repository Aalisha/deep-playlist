Mum I found a guy that I really want
I know you say i'm young
But he don't wanna hurt me
Never has to try, special kinda guy
I get these funny feelings
Whenever he's around me

One touch of love
That was only to my dear
And i'm never gonna let you go away now

Call him what you want
Call him what you like
He's always there for me
Whenever I feel lonely
Don't know what I'll say
Don't know what I'll do
Coz if you change your mind
Then I'll go crazy yeah

Chorus
One touch of love
