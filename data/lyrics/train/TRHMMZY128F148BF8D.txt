How could you say there's nothing
How could you say what's wrong
How could you say there's nothing
When everything's alright

That's what I lose as left on sit
And I can't even tear myself
Now as the blood trips from your arm tonight
It starts to take me off this place

Fall again, fall again
Dream again
I can dream again
Fall again
