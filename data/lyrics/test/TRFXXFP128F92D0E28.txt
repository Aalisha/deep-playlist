Lovin' you
Has made my life much sweeter, baby
Baby, since I've got you
Everything is alright

When I'm lovin' you
I feel so good inside, ooh baby
When I make love to you
I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise, oh

You know you make me feel
You make me feel so good
From my head down to my toes

Sometimes I wanna shout
I wanna scream, tell the world about it
There's a girl in my mind
Your love is so good, so good, so good, so good to me

Needing you
I need you in everything I do
