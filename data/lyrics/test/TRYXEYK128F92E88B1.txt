Well, when the sun rose this morning
I was feeling mighty bad
My baby said; "good morning"
Hell, it made me mad
Because I was evil, evil hearted me
I'm down right evil, evil as a man can be

Well, she even cooked my breakfast
And she brought it to my bed
I took a sip of coffee, and throwed cup at her head
Because I was evil, evil hearted me
Yeah, I'm down right evil, evil as a man can be

I don't even care if my baby leaves me flat
...
