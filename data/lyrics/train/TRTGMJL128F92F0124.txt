Grey skies and light fading
Headlamps making patterns on the wall
Uptown, it's dead now, but
Out here no one seems to care at all

Sick girls and sick boys and
Each one lining up to take him home
They hold tight, their coin and
They pray no one has to see them fall

I'm there, yeah, I serve them
The one with the empty looking eyes
Come closer, you'll see me
The face that is used to telling lies

Saturday nights in neon light
Sunday in the cell
Pills enough to make me feel ill
...
