Show me signs, show me billboards,
something to guide my way.
I walk with purpose in darkness,
stumble in the light of day.

So won't you help me?
Won't you help me out?
I'm starting over here.
And I'm so tired, I can't stay awake.
Nothing is safe, but so much at stake.
When we awake, oh, it's back to business,
to the business of hanging on.
