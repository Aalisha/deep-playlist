Lying in the gutter
I cut the cord from my mother
She pat me on the head and say
Go to sea boy, get to sea man.

She comin' to my house
Trouble trouble trouble
Go to sea boy, get to sea man

My luck in the gutter black
I guess I'm running back
To you
You in my brain; you in my heart
You in my brain; you in my heart
...
