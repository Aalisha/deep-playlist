I could be an angel
Dressed in the devil's clothes
But they'll never let me in
Not as long as anger grows
Are you willing to forgive
What you never can forget
Where I come from is my country
And that I can't regret

Easily you come to me
Summoning The Spirit we
Only have a minute
To never grow old

You say I'm not welcome
In your family's home
They are ready for divorce
And they do not even know
All the ways that I behave
In the safety of your heart
Not willing to receive
What may be the softest part
So willing to deceive-so
Very in the dark
