I've got a Humpty Dumpty heart
You dropped it and broke it apart
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Could never put it together again

But when I gave to you my heart

That was my doom, my heart went boom
I got a Humpty Dumpty heart

Now, my heart is a fragile thing
When dropped it won't bounce or ring
It ain't no joke 'cause when it's broke
