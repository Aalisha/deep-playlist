The rnornent I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
Oh while combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus dear
While riding I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you
...
