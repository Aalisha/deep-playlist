Storm clouds spreading
Black horizons oil slick the southern sky
What prospects should I gather here to motivate my corpse to rise?
Bloodshot
My eyes reject the staleness of this day
And 'reason' gives purpose for all the pills i have to swallow
Driving
My heart is dead and hollow
Metal boxes racing by
Ringing out the death of my life
...
