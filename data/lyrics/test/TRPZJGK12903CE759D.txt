One by one, doing the crime
Never thought twice, never did time
Never turn back, never go home
Never get used to being alone
One by one, into the sea
Too many eyes are staring at me
Two by two, watch as they go
Who are you and what do you know
I got your heart in hand
Never let go
Make it
Take it
Never let go
