Give me a reason
Why I'm feeling so blue
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
Give me a reason
Why I can't feel my heart
Everytime you leave my side
I just fall apart
And when you're fast asleep
I wonder where you go
Can you tell me I wanna know

Because I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you
Nothing's wrong
I don't mean to carry on

But give me a reason
Why I can't concentrate
The world is turning upside down
Spinning round and round
Now give me a reason
Why I now understand 
the beauty and simplicity in everything surrounding me
You got a way of spreading magic everywhere
