I got a date with the night
Putting out my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight
We're sweatin' in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight

Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke
Choke choke choke

Don't tell me to fix her
