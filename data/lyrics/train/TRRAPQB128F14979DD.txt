(Chorus)
Tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that, ice in
You aint, you aint, iced out
Tuck, tuck that ice in
I shine like a lighthouse

Tuck, tuck that ice in,
you ain't, you ain't iced
Lights on, lights off
I shine like a lighthouse

tuck, tuck that, ice in
You aint, you aint, iced out
Tuck, tuck that ice in
I shine like a lighthouse
Tuck, tuck that ice in,
you ain't, you ain't iced
Lights on, lights off
I shine like a lighthouse

(TRICK DADDY)
My shit is platinum,
these assholes wearin' white gold
See I'm to smart for this cause,
all my shit paid for
And why should I rent a house,
when I can huy it and write it off
Make it my Florida home for the summer,
round winter time just rent it out
See I ain't none of them,
who ride around on rented rims
Change on the weekend,
and floss in him mama's Benz
See when I hit the scene,
I be so fresh so clean
White fitted, white tee,
ain't nan nigga like me
What kind of shit you on,
wearin' f**kin' rhinestones
Them cubic zirconia son,
Them ain't f**kin' diamonds,
So you gonna f**k around,
and get gangrene at the arm
Who'd rob and kill one,
over some mother-f**kin' slum
Your chain is crazy,
that shit for gazey
and it ain't real,
unless its copper or stainless steel
So whoever made it...
you shouldn't have paid it
Twenty grand for a watch
thats f**kin' gold plated!

(Chorus)

(BABY)
16 out the house,
17 gold mouth,
18 on the block,
Nigga got them thangs out,
Birdman stunna, nigga we don't sit in jail
Real n(Chorus)
Tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that,
tuck, tuck that, ice in
You aint, you aint, iced out
Tuck, tuck that ice in
I shine like a lighthouse

Tuck, tuck that ice in,
you ain't, you ain't iced
Lights on, lights off
I shine like a lighthouse

tuck, tuck that, ice in
You aint, you aint, iced out
Tuck, tuck that ice in
I shine like a lighthouse
Tuck, tuck that ice in,
you ain't, you ain't iced
Lights on, lights off
I shine like a lighthouse

(TRICK DADDY)
