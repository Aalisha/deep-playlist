[Spoken intro:]
What's up girl?
He stood me up again
Again?
Well, what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?
Yes, honey, I love him, he is fine,
He does a lot of nice things for me
I know he used to do nice stuff for you,
But what has he done for you lately?
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?
