Sensitive thats what I am
Make no mistake about it
Cause little things
Certainly mean so much to me
Maybe I should tell you
That I have my faults
And there are no guarantees
Oh Babay can't you see

I'm only human
Don't ask me for too much too fast
I'm only human babe
I'll be so carefull not to ever hurt you

Emotional thats what I am Feelings run deep inside me
