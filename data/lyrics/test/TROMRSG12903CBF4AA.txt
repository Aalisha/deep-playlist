You say you hurting, almost lost your mind
And the man you got now, mistreat you all the time
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurt me too

You love him more, when you should love him less
While I won't stand, to see you take all of his mess
When things go wrong, go wrong with you, babe it hurt me too

Quit him now, before he put you down
Maybe I won't be there, when the tears start falling down
...
