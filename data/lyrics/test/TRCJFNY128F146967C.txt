I love the thrill, I love the scene
Imagine you in the white light
So beautiful, you watch me bleed
You're stabbing me from inside now

Kneel down and tell me about your world
Tell me something that I don't know
You know nothing about the world around you

(Chorus)
It's not enough - broken in two
It's not enough - speaking the truth
