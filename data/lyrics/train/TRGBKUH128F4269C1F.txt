Pack up your troubles in your old gym bag
you gotta dance to the tune of bolivian ragamuffin
i'll take short breaks, love her to the outbreaks
Standing on the seashore, lookin' at the city
see the street light, dog bite, go lady on the td8
the wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves
there's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby
Can't break, cabbage head
try and get a salad made
