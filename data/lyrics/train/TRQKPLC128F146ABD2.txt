Free, I long to be free
I long for the day I believe
That all You say, You see in me is true
That's hard for me to do
It's hard for me to die to myself
And trust my life to someone else

So come, empty me out
I'm no good without
You inside of me

Come and fill my heart with hope
Come and fill my life with love
Come and fill my soul with strength to carry on
Because from here the climb is steep the road is long
Come and fill my days with dreams
Empty me of all the empty things that I hold on to
Come and fill my heart with You
