Now dawns the payday of devil's deal
Transplanted love for everyday meal
You started the game, so you gotta play
Now hear me say

This white flag is stained
Upon the promise to cherish the wrong
Wrecking of your fragile pink world
Wipes out the stink of your bastard worlds

No time to retake this life
Ablaze are the memories untied

This price has taken place
Here's nothing we can't face
World turns like a big wheel of fortune
Buy a one-way ticket to torture
