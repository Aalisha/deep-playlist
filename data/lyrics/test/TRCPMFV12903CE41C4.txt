In order for you to play with this record,
You must tune your guitar to ours.
We will start with the first string...
We would drag ourselves to bed.
And sleep took everything I had.
I kept it up till he would call.
You made me feel like a criminal.
And then there's you,
You kept a smile though I would always walk the wire.
You gave it all.
I gave you reason to have doubt.
