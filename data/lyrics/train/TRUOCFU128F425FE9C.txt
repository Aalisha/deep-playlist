Who started this? I don't know
You're already packed and ready to go
I hope she's worth it, after all we've been through
You're breakin' my heart but I have to be strong
So go right ahead, I'll get along
Just one thing, you better know it's true
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna wish you had me back
Late at night, when you're starin' at the stars above
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
