Eye on the crowd, baby
Looking for someone to satisfy my need
Someway or somehow
Gonna find someone to spend some time with me

Well I ain't looking at forever
Just a woman to treat a good man right
You look so good you got me thinking
You might satisfy my soul tonight

There's no harm done
I know you're the one
You don't have to worry
No hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun

I ain't looking for a woman
Who's always trying to put me down
