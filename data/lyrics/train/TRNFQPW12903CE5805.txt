The Wind Blows Through
My Open Door
Where Love And Life Has Gone Before
My Wish For Peace Came True
I'm Left With Nothing Left To Do
But Sit And Stare At Days Gone By
No Tears Left To Cry
No Nountains Left To Climb
Everybody's Got To Feel This Way Sometime
Everybody's got To Feel There's No Escaping What Is Real
Feel Good, Feel Good, Feel Good
Hearts Can Be Broken
