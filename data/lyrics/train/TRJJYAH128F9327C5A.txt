Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh woah woah oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah oh
It seems we've lost our touch
Used to be so in love, yeah, uh
But somehow we've gotten off-track
And we never really got it back, no, yeah
I think we better find a way, yeah
And get right back to the good old days, good old days
Wanna make it to Heaven's gate, yeah (oh)
And we need to escalate, I need
I need direction (I need direction)
To that street called love (to that street called love, yeah)
Lead me to that road (trying to get home, yeah)
Trying to get home (oh, take me to love street, yeah)
Now life is gone and skipped a beat
Tell me where are all the dancing feet, yeah
Boy I tell you there's always something going on
Tell me why can't we all just get along
Keep struggling (yeah) just to get by, oh (oh)
So many hills, mountains to climb, yeah
We should all be ashamed of ourselves
'Cause if we don't love ourselves
