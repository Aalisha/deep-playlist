You let me sleep on your couch and your floor even in your bed window side
You let me have the corner in your closet a place where my boxed up life could
reside
In return I showed you how life was like a painting
One so violent and depressing you just closed your eyes
When you saw me disintegrating
You'd stand by and just watch me vaporize as the world fell in love with me
You fell out or so it seemed
Change your sheets to rid yourself of me
Because its been weeks and you still speak in your sleep
Remember when you brought home that picture of your dad
Hung it on the wall as a reminder of what it is to be a man
