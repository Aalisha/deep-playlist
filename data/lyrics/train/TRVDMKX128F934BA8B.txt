Good -vs- Evil, Evil -vs- Good
Choose your Side now
'Cause that's all you could
People say it's right
But other's say it's wrong,
The decisions up to you.
Forced to kill, is your command
Destruction on another,
Is what he Want's,
Forced by the beast to believe
That it's right, It's the final command
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction, Annihilation of the Vengeful
