Geah, wutup niggas
The Compton cyco is back
In your shit for the nine deuce and check this out
My nigga Scarface is in the motherfuckin' house
I am walking down the blocks wit pocketful of rocks
And we 'bout to drop some gangsta shit

I guess it's true what they say
When your too far gone ain't no turning back
And coming from the Compton mack thats a fuckin' fact
Livin' in the city where bitches won't
Give up the pussy for free so a nigga don't

So heres my story, another story about a nigga
Who lives his life by the fuckin' trigga
Gotta get my serve on, nigga you don't hear me though
Throw up the hood, might blast on 5-0

First I hit the Ides and get pumped up
Now I'm rollin' in the car kinda slumped up
I pop the glove box, then I reach the block
Then I plug your ass in the chest with the glock

And that's how the shits get done
I guess I'm a mutherfuckin' nigga on the run
But I won't let them take me alive, so I don't sleep
'Cuz, geah, I'm in too deep
