It Ain't gonna save me
It Ain't gonna save me, no how

It Ain't gonna save me
It Ain't gonna save me, no how

It Ain't gonna save me
It Ain't gonna save me, no how

It Ain't gonna save me
It Ain't gonna save me, no how

I took a walk the other day and thought about how things used to be and then a cloud came into sky it shed on me and I don't know why, Ever since that day I've never been the same tired and lonely with no one to blame and in this bedroom is where I sit cause I don't really don't give a shit

It Ain't gonna save me
It Ain't gonna save me, no how
