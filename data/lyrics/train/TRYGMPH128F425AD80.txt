Watch my life
Pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't want to waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah...
'Cause I want you
And I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger
Like a burning

To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken
And I'm fading

I'm half the man I thought I would be:
But you can have what's left of me
I've been dying inside
Little by little

No where to go
But going out of my mind
...
