I saw a proline sticker just other day
Another mental fool with no right to procreate
Elbows bumping, tempers growing
Veins bulge in my neck and eyes
We're just a bunch of animals
That fuck to survive

Make room, make room
Spread the fuck right out
Make room, make room
For the hand of doom

I built a wall around myself
From a world that's on the brink
There's a problem with my armor
'Cause there's just too many chinks

Cyanide the water supply
Take a drink and watch 'em die
Release ebola in the air
Swell and bleed out everywhere
Sarin gas for you to smell
Take a train ride, next stop hell

A Y2K census and we're all filled up
Like a thick head of beer overflowing its cup
A culling of humans, a matter of space
...
