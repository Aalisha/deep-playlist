Hey, yo, gimme that microphone an' I'ma handle it
Don't even worry 'bout it, we about to handle it
Alkaholiks in this bitch, about to handle it
Pass that weed, lil' mama, I can handle it

Back that ass up, bitch, I can handle it
Pass my drink, lil' nigga, I can handle it
Don't even worry 'bout it, we about to handle it
It's Likwit crew, nigga, we straight from Los Angeles

It's the L, the I, the K, the Ss
We still the West's freshest 'cause we started from the essence
Look, Ma, no hands, they gave us microphone stands
So I can stand with two bottles while I dance with the fans

Dance with me, press against me 'cause I'm reachin' out to grab it
Slappin' asses 'cause CaTashtrophe's an Alkie chick magnet
I'm a beauty pageant judge with a glass full of buds
It's one fifty nine, they're tryin' to shut down the club

Last call for alcohol, unless you meet us at the after hours
Pull up to the front, yeah, baby girl, the house is ours
Don't bug, spillin' shit on my rug
I'm a Rollo with a motto, safe sex, soft drugs

Thugs in my mansion askin' why the fuck is candles lit
I'm about to kick these niggaz out but I can handle it
