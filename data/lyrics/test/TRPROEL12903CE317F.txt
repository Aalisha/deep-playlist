Put down the gun, put down the gun
Put down the gun, put down the gun

Put down the gun, put down the gun
Put down the gun, put down the gun

Put down the gun, put down the gun
Put down the gun, put down the gun

Put down the gun
Put it down

"Shut up," he said
"Let me speak for a minute or two or three
Now you're gonna stop interrupting me"
So what ya gonna do?
'Cause looking in his face shows a life revealing years of pain
So we'll drop down, let go all because he said so

Boys - with shiny violent killing
Toys - it's all a bit too real now
Noise - this cycle will continue
Boys

Put down the gun, put down the gun
Put down the gun, put down the gun
