tell you like it is with a kiss
baby when it drips from your lips
tell you like it is its like this
don't be such a slave to your brother

baby get shaky after school oooh ooh there you ooh there you baby go crazy break the rules oooh ooh there you ooh there you go go go go go go ohoh there you go!

tell you like it is with a kiss
