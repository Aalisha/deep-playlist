Remember hallways, you're waiting always
To see behind the door
You never seen her, you're gonna meet her
The first time so unsure
She smiles your way through a window
You smile right back, she runs away
You wish little girls would sit still
Just a little bit longer, longer

And she's still a mystery to me
I thought I'd grow up gracefully
