I just want to get some satisfaction
I just can't stand this kind of situation, yeah
I just want to get some good satisfaction,
Yeah oh yeah

Whoa my people can't you see
We were brought down here down here
Down there in captivity

So much sorrow and whoa so much pain
This I know every day things won't be the
Same
