If you see something that looks like a star
And it's shooting up out of the ground
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar

And you just can't escape from the sound
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
We were children once, playing with toys

And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high-heeled boys

The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams

But today you just read that the man was shot dead
...
