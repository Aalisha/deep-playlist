Half a day from nowhere,
Hurrying to get there
Ninety miles an hour
In two Plymouth wagons
The Avis lady gave us a smile

Tom's getting uptight
Max'll will make it all right
Ken's asleep in back
Artie's reading a map
That's takin' us where we're heading to
We should be there soon

There's a sign up ahead
Wash my face and get fed
And that voice in my head
Keeps sayin' I'm lonely
But I'm only payin' my dues
Holiday Inn Blues
