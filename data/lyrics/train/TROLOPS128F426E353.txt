Heaven knows, the devil's told
Everything on you is getting out of control
I see your fist raised up and clinched
I know you better than this

Don't hold your breath
Just get as far away as you can possibly get
I know you better than you
I'm takin' my time cause I got nothing to do

Wait a minute something's wrong
I know it won't take long
Let's burn a hole into the sky
And take a look into God's eyes

I know it don't seem right
But it won't take all night
...
