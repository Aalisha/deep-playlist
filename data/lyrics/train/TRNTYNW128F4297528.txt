Hey little soldier you ain't ready for war"

"Show you how to do this"

"Amateur"

Y'all know who the fuck I be
I be the P to the A can't forget the C
And if you spell it with a K then you got it right
PackFM and I'm here to rock the house tonight

Welcome to the rap world [NIGGA!] population me
Been in the building since back to when it was in the place to be
Stopped doing shit for love so you can start the hating please
Once I leave these fucking agencies they drop their rates and fees
'Cos the game just ain't the same if I ain't playing it
If it's hot I've done said it so don't bother saying it
And if it ain't nice don't say nothing at all
I'm looking forward to some instrumental albums from y'all
This is a message for ya'll getting in to a brawl
I got a strong arm I slam dunk a medicine ball
You can carry on, but don't get carried away
