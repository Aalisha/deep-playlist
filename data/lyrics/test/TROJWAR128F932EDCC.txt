He tied a feather to the hook for to get you to look
And by the time you know what took you, you already took
He's got a line in the water
He's a fisher of men

He put the thorns on the rose for to get you to bleed
And by the time you know what stuck you, the pain's in deep
He's got a line in the water
He's a fisher of men

He's got a lot on the line
He's a fisher of men

He's a fisher of men
