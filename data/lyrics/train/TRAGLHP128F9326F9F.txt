Here we go axemen, here we go
At the pep rally, I stole the show
Wearing our purple and our whites
Hey, look around there's so much white

Do you wanna live this teenage dream?
The punk white privileged scene
Oh quarterback, I'll steal your axe
And cut it out of here

'Cause I'm out of my head
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my life tonight

I'm going out there
And I'm going fast
And I'm going hard

And I'm going crazy
Do you wanna watch?
Do you wanna come?

'Cause I'm out of my head
I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my life tonight
