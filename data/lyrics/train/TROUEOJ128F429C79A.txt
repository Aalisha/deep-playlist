Big wheels on rims, I'm flexin'
New chain around my neck, I'm flexin'
Got dough, you can check, I'm flexin'
Matter of fact, I'm big boy flexin'

Big wheels on rims, I'm flexin'
New chain around my neck, I'm flexin'
Got dough, you can check, I'm flexin'
Matter of fact, I'm big boy flexin'

Big car, big shoes and a big booty ***
One hand on my wheel just to see my jewelry glitz
[Incomprehensible] *** on my fingas and wrist
Never would've thought I'd live like this

Drive Toyota and a Honda and no other in the streets
Like D4L, 'Betcha Can't Do It Like Me'
I'm a [Incomprehensible]
They will tell you how it is, this is Shop Boyz summer

Big wheels on rims, I'm flexin'
New chain around my neck, I'm flexin'
Got dough, you can check, I'm flexin'
Matter of fact, I'm big boy flexin'

Big wheels on rims, I'm flexin'
New chain around my neck, I'm flexin'
Got dough, you can check, I'm flexin'
Matter of fact, I'm big boy flexin'
