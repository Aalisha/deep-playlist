This is more or less the lyric to Singing Cowboy from the Live/Studio album which differs slightly from the versions on Four Sail and Reel To Real.

Singing Cowboy, Gotta Lasso In You Your Hand
Will You Ever Understand
It's A, It's A Do Or Die Boy
You Know Your Life is up to You

So When You Say Goodbye Don't You Cry
Cos Look out Kid I'm Coming After You
Singing Cowboy
Got A Gun Around Your Waist
Wanna Shoot a little taste
at me and my boy
Just What's Gotten Into You
You Gonna Shoot Me Through
