You knew me
Even as a child I heard
You call me closer
Cleary like a song I've always known
You would play for me

Like the breaking of the dawn
Everyday I long for more of You

Where would I be without Your love
Where would I be without Your hand
On my life

Lifted
Through the valleys
Through the pain
I know You're with me
...
