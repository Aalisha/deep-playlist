(Verse One)
Aiyyo, I got a slight problem I smoke weed too much
Knees buckle the -uck up when I'm splittin my dutch
Back up back up! Ain't nobody hittin for free
It's just E Doubl-E, Keith Murray, and me
It cost twenty if you're down with it
Aiyyo son I ride around with my hooptie tinted
to ride around blitted
Cause I be feenin for that pookie
I smoke the good shhh, save the backyard boogie for all groupies
And I be, smokin up the hotel lobby
Between mo' sheets than the Isleys, I'm high G
I'm holdin it down for the B-Rrrah-I-C
K, blaze, tell you to get bluhh politely
(Hit the funky if you're riding around gettin blitz)
