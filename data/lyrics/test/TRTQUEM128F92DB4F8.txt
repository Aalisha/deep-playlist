I swear I'm coming for you, I'm coming to prove
that I am stronger and faster than you could ever imagine
You knew this would happen
But still you chose to do just what they told you to do
And now I'm coming for you to leave you black and blue
I swear I'll show you something knew
I'm gonna do what I have to do to you

You best not catch me in the street
You best not come at me or you're beat
To this day you can't see me
You best not catch me in the street
If you fucking come at me you're beat
To this day you can't see me
