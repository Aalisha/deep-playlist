Being in love is a beautiful, beautiful thing-oh

And he makes me say--
oooo oooo oooo oooo
oooo oooo oooo oooo
yeah yeah yeah yeah (come on)
oooo oooo oooo oooo (yeah yeah)
oooo oooo oooo oooo

[Verse 1]
I gotta guy who's got me feeling like a butterfly, oh
So beautiful and he loves me so
He's the kind that will never
Let me go

[B-Section]
And I wanna just clap, clap, clap my hands yall (Cause I feel all right)
I wanna dance in the rain
Tell the world about my real thing
