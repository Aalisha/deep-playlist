Oh my God, I think I'm having a rap attack.

Somebody get a doctor!
Quick, man

She's having an attack!

She said 'rap attack', man, not 'heart attack'

Oh, you mean she's alright then?

Of course, man

You never heard of a Mr. Magic Rap Attack?
Where is this guy from, man?

Oh, I heard of a heart attack or a big mac attack
But what's a rap attack?

Come here, man, I see I'ma have to explain it to you like this
See, a rap attack means.

Deejays jammin in the street
MC's rappin to the beat
The people downstairs sayin they can't sleep
Cause the people upstairs are stompin their feet
