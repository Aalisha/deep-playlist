Yeah I'm alright
I'll deal with the Sticks and Stones yeah
City's quiet tonight
It better be or else I'll show it
A fucking good fight
I feel like the city deserves shit
For taking a life
A talent that I tried to nurture
It's a sick sick place with no antibiotic
We tried to calm it down but it carries on chaotic.
Its a big brick now through the window of his office,
Taking from the wall that the Kids bounced on it

When they are gone,
You know the memory lives on
Im in a situation at a BBQ raising money for their funerals
