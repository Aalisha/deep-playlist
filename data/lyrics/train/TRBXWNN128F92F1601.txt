Crack of dawn I hit the road
Set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack

The foreman says, "I'm late again"
He can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that

I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the home fires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain

She keeps the home fires burning
Ooh, and it's her warm loving
That keeps me returning again and again
...
