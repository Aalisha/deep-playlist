Candlelight and all things bright come into our room
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room
Now now the winter glows

See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room
Now now the winter glows
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you
