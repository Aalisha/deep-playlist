Na na na na na na
His mercies endureth for me
Wooy
Let's rise and shine and give Jah the glory
His mercy endureth for me
Make me free like a bird in a tree
Let's sing and shout his praises forever
So the world can see
Give thanks and praise to his majesty
Knowing that he is the conquering lion
And he can set you free
Jah children open your eyes and see
The meek shall inherit the earth
And the wicked shall get his reward
Promise to give you the world
But don't listen dem boys they a fraud
They'll never get away
no no no, no no no
And if you're weary, tired and heavy laden
Your burden you know he will bear
Jah will protect you so have no fear
