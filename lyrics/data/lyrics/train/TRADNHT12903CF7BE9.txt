And so far we had someone
That doesn't work for everyone.
But I'm thinking this could be a one,
If we put our minds to it.

And I came round today,
So I had so much to say;
And I know you hate seeing me this way,
But I'm having fun.

You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
