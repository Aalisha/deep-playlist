Get on your feet,
Nap time is over
With the quickness
Can I get a witness
Like Jehovah
AMEN
Keep it up til I say when now
Im busting out the playpen

(ERA!)
Of J Gueverra
(VERA!)
Sparking revolutions like the one ton imera
The thought of getting played from the hands of the creator
Locusts devouring
All the hocus pocus
...
