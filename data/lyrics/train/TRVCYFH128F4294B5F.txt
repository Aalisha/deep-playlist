I've got a gal here in this town
Don't want nobody to bother but me
I've got a gal here in this town
Don't want nobody to bother but me

'Cause she's strickly, tailor made
Boy, she ain't no hand me down
Catch you messin' with her, boy
I'll sho' shoot ya down

Now, keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
You know she don't belong to you

Oh, keep yo' hands off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

She got some little bitty hands
An them great big legs
She sho' look good
'Cause everybody says it

But keep yo' hands off her
...
