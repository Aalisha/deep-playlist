Give me a kiss, give me a kiss
I want to find out what I missed
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me at a time like this.

Posters in blue look just like you
A snapshot on a magazine
Now all the rage, turn back the page
At one time you were just like me
Here in...

Teenland oh oh oh
Teenland oh oh oh
