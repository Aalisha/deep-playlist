(VERSE 1)
Take away my prime from the mouth of the lion
Savage jaws are the price we pay
Take away the lies, let me see with my own eyes
Walk along the narrow way

(BRIDGE 1)
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh! What a waste! (Oh! What a waste!)
Your sword is no use when you're standing face to face
(Standing... there face to face)
Oh! What a waste!
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)
A mystic human race
Your sword no use to you when standing face to face
(Standing... there face to face)
They say

(CHORUS 1)
Hey fool watch out!
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
Hey fool watch out!
