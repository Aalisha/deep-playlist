Let's take this back two thousand five
Drinks are pouring, girls so fine
So many dimes, got dollars signs
And there she goes right on the spot
Got a taste so sweet I swear this beat
Will make you wanna drop

She wears a new dress everyday
No, she won't stop making the crowd scream
I can't hear anything, but hey, hey
It's Miss L.A. again, again

Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down, I want more

I wrote her a song
Not Delilah, not Kelsey
Had 'em both in my palm
