Have you ever walked alone at night
Like a man against the world?
No one takes your side
A boat against the tide.
When your faith is shaken
You start to break
And your heart can't find the words.
Tossed upon the sand

I give you a man against the world.
All the people cheer till the end is near
And the hero takes a fall.
Then they'll drag you through the mud.
