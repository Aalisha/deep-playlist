Hurry on home, all the love is gone
Hurry on home for me
This village has a voice, it's ringing through my ears
Hurry on home for me

Too many faces I almost defeated
I never fell this far
But now that I see through the thin air in here, I see
That you just don't care

And I'm just the talk of the town
Famous for fooling around
But honey don't corner me in
Till I can reign in here
...
