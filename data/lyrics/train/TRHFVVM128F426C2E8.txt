And I found my head uncrowned and all life's sweet nectar flowing down
the cracks and seams wasted on some petty little prayers
And I
reached up for despair but I was well below that cherished stage and
all
my mangled hopes all song unsung
Chorus:
I fear I've wasted all my sun
I fear I've wasted all my time
Everything is faded
Smiles are fabricated now
I fear I've wasted all my sun
...
