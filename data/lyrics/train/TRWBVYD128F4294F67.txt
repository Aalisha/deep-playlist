Well, I was thinking that I shoulda
But I didn't ever leave you but baby, I'm leavin' tonight
And theres a trucker drinking coffee in the station
Who can give me a ride

Well, I was thinking about a heading down to
Mobile, Alabama and that was just last Saturday night
Well, I can leave you if I wanna, little baby
And I'm gonna tonight

'Cause I got a bucket full of tears and a hard luck story
Theres a bad moon rising behind
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you
...
