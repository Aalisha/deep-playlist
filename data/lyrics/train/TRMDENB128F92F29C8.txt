[Verse 1]
Whoever thought Paul Barman would change the game?
I started rhyming when the radio was unbearably lame
Rappaz R. N. Dainja
"Depression is closely followed
By delusions of grandeur." (--Karen Horney)

While reading the Rubaiyat
And make babies in bunny slippers
With the JBs rockin' the Honey Drippers

Cock Mobster

A cornucopia of warm fallopia
Cock Mobster
My dandy voice makes the most
Anti-choice granny's panties moist
