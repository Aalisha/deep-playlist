I try to reason and tell myself you'll return
But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone
You were mine for only a minute
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it

You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind
You're not gonna stay
But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby
I lost you, baby, you were gone
