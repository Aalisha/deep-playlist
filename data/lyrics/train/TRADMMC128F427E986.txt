all stars
scooby doo soundtrack
things that go bump in the night
there's a chill in the air
ya hear a creak on the stair
a knock on your door
is there anybody out
they're out to get u
to catch u and make u
swear your vows
howling and prowling
your shivering quivering
swear your vows

you cannot run
and you cannot hide
ya you gotta face it baby
things bump in the night
wherever you run and wherever you hide ya you gotta face it baby
things go bump bump bump in the night


tell me whos spooking you
is there a scooby doo
...
