My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of thieves in the night
Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd
Open your arms, I want to be found

Maybe I'm calling your name in the night
Open our eyes, we'll feel with our sight

A want is a lack but also desire
A need can be nothing but should be held higher
A need is a want wearing disguise
It can be confused if fueled by desire
