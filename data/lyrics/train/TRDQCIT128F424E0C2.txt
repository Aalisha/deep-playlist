Got a fist full of ice
Got a head full of speed
Got a fist full of ice
Got a head full of speed
I hear the sound of destruction
I smell a rose of seduction

Got a fist full of ice baby
Got a head full of speed
Just gimme what I want now
Just gimme what I need

I don't fear anyone
Stray dog fighting
haters run
