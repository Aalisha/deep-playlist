i am sorry that i set my sights
on the things i read
something meant for your husband
maybe you left it under the bed

once upon a love those words blew free and secret
the pages lay around
drifted to the hands of the publisher
and the greedy generations on down

burn all the letters
(someone is always watching)
the government's on the phone
(whether openly or secretly)
burn all the letters
(now breathe life)
send them on
(into your story)
to a safer home
(i said burn it to secrecy)
burn all the letters
brand them in you before you go
...
