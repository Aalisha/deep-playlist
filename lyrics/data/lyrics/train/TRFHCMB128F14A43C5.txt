On a perfect day I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible tell me can you weather the storm?

Cause I need some body who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times she will always, always be right there.

Sunny days everybody loves them tell me baby can you stand the rain? Storms will come this we know for sure (this we know for sure) can you stand the rain?

(yeah yeah) Love unconditional I'm not asking just of you
Girl to make it last I'll do whatever needs to be done.
