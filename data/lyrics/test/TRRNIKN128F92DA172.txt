I was born on the back streets
On the rotten side of town
I never had me nothin'
Just people puttin' me down
Living on the dark side
Across the railroad track
Leaving wasn't easy
But I'm never going back

Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
Never surrender
When you're up against the world
Never surrender
Stand up fight them all
