Ain't I'm a dog
Well, I come in this morning 'bout a half past three
My good gal said she was a-leavin' me
I said, now wait a minute, baby, let me help you pack
'Cause when you leave, you know you can't come back
Oh, ain't I'm a dog
Yeah, ain't I'm a dog
(Ain't I'm a dog)
Oh, yes, now ain't I'm a dog
(Ain't I'm a dog)
Yeah, ain't I'm a dog, I'm always steppin' around
(Chuck chuck, chuck chuck a boom)
Well, I tell her myself that I'ma gonna be good
And do all the things that a good man should
A good lookin' woman starts a-walkin' my way
I tell myself there's another day
