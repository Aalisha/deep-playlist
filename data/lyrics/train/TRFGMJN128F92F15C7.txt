If you don't take me to Paris on a lover's getaway, it's alright, it's alright
If I'd rather wear your t-shirt than a sexy negligee, it's alright, It's alright
Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
It's kinda nice to know that it

Doesn't have to be perfect
Maybe every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly
Love can be rough around the edges, tattered at the seams
Honey, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me

If your mother doesn't like the way I treat her baby boy, it's alright, it's alright
