It's not the same without him here
Twenty years of him dead and gone
This Vodka does a memory clear
Though it's too hard to imagine what these tears are for

A walking poster boy for all that's good
He got swallowed by the cracks before he understood
She likes to think he loved her but it hurts so bad
'Cause now she knows she's wrong

It always seemed to strike her strange
His working late until the morning, spending so much cash
And the sweet smell of his angel's hair
...
