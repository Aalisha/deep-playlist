Little boy on the first day of school
Got some crayons and started to draw
He drew colors all over the paper
For colors was what he saw
And the teacher said. "What you doin' young man?"
"I'm paintin' flowers" he said
"It's not the time for art, young man
And anyway flowers are green and red...
There's a time for everything young man
And a way it should be done
You've got to show concern for everyone else
For you're not the only one

And she said...
Flowers are red young man and
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than they way they always have been seen

But the little boy said...
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in a flower and I see every one
...
