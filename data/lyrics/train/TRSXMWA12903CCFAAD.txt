Were you just being funny
When you cut down my tree?
I was hanging my hat there
On a bent knee

Were you just being clever?
There's so much I don't know
I'll be tracing my outline
In the sunshine

I got hit with the handle
When you split through my coats
Now I'm searching through empty pockets
They fill me up with your ghost

I'll make a ladder
Climb these words here
Take it higher
Oh, have mercy
