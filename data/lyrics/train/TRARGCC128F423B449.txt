Bahar:
Hey, Mr January, you still here?
Another resolution that I broke this year.
Made it into february-valentines but your flowers already died.

Mandy:
Baby, baby, it's not a love thing.
I'm not mad about it.
Just getting even on it.
Baby, baby, it's not a love thing.
I'm not mad about it.

Chorus:
You think you got me but I got you beat.
Getting nasty first will make the last word taste so sweet.
Gonna burst your bubble, boy, you're going down.
Pop, Pop, the sound... get you back on the rebound.

Mandy:
Baby, listen to what I'm about to say.
Little miss impatience is my middle name.
And if sometimes doesn't fit when I try it on.
