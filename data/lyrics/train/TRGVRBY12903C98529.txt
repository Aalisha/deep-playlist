This song is one of our first songs off the new album. 
It's about punks, skins, straights.
I was walking along the street
Minding my own affair
Suddenly two policemen grabbed me
And I wasn't aware.
They said, "Is your name Matey?"
I said, "Why sure".
He says, "You're the punk
That I've been waiting for.
You're nicked"

Better the devil you know
Confess I guess I was the lesser of the two evils
Convalesce about the stress the test caused
Had me up and on the board,
Now Im chairman of the board
Im coming back for sequels
Do you ever really think you
Nothing on this far-gone son
All these people
Theyre laughing at the shit Ive done
Ive sailed the seven seas to catch a breeze and took it back home in a trunk
Met a matador who said its my woman is more
Terrifying than any red bull that he saw
Set a sail set a rail
Met them Kings and Queens
Theres so many trust
Just the amphetamines
Well her dream wouldve been
That the boys got clean
That her father never got his heart
Caught up in the mans machine
Well it seems even if I got away
Theres always a part of me willing to stay

Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
All weve got to keep us together
Stone, glass, concrete and gravel
Underground travelling
Overcast weather
