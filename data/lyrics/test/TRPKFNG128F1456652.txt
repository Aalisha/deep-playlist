As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes

Traveling somewhere, could be anywhere
There's a coldness in the air but I don't care
We drift deeper life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound
As the rush comes

Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
Embrace me, surround me
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
