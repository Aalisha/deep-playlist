Put on your coat put on your hat
Step out the door find you're tumbling down the steps of life
You want to make a difference but a fact's a fact
You got too many things upon your mind
You want to make it big but you're playing for time
Can't forgive the life you live
And if you had a choice you'd fulfill your wish

Coz just an average man
Do the best I can I go to work everyday
Collect my pay save it all up for another grey day, another great day
What the hell can I say, I can't go back to sleep
All because I wake No what they say, skies are grey Another great day
You know its here to stay
