I met a man with eyes like glass
Whose useful days were gone and passed
He told me in a cardboard tone
How long ago he once had flown

When I was young he did relate

From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...

And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of led
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea
