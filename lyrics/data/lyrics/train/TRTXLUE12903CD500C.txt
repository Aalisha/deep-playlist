As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin' don't say a word 'cos I already heard
What your body's saying to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love I want a slow hand
