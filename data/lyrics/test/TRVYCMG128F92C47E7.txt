Baby girl, like cinnamon, hot for the skin he's in
Oops makes you wanna sin again (sin again)
Defense is startin to break, it's more then you can take,
wanna getcha, getcha then your heart'll break.
He's got no shame, he's got your name,
and your number, baby now you start to wonder,
what's in store, what the hell,
that spell that he ge ge gotcha under.

Playin a role, he don't care what he stole.
He's a gentleman lover, getch you under cover.
He'll try to prove that his love is for you,
just when you think he's changed his tune...

He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha
Break anotha heartbeat (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha
break you're heartbeat (eh!)

He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha
Break anotha heartbeat (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha (eh!)
He'll break anotha
break you're heartbeat (eh!)
