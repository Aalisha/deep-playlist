Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
When the judge's constipation go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone
