On the legs of lightning
The storm rears in defeat
Rising in vain once more with the sea
Grey hand's reaching
Cold under the swell
Withered in the forge of our unbelief

All gods breed
All gods die
All gods will pay

We'll exorcise
All of these fathers of lies
Burned holes for eyes
Behold the pyre of gods

Uncrusaders, heretics to all faith
...
