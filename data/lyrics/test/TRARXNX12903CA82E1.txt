No more my God, I boast no more
Of all the duties I have done
I quit the hopes I held before
To trust the merits of Thy Son

No more my God
No more my God
No more my God
I boast no more

Now, for the loss, I bear his name
What was my gain, I count my loss
My former pride, I call my shame
And nail my glory to His cross
...
