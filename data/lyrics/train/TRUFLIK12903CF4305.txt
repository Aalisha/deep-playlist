I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
My desperation mirrors your future so bleak.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
I'll gratify my action so to speak.
The massacre of hundreds of innocent humans echoes through me, like the chorus of a symphonic orchestra.
Fear imprinted in their eyes so deeply, deep.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
My desperation mirrors your future so bleak.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
I'll gratify my actions so to speak.
