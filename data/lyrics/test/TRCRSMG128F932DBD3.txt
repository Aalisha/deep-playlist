Cut the ropes, cut the ropes, cut this empty road,
Unplug this factory town,
I'll take my compass down.

Departure boards, double doors, humming exit signs,
The tracks and railway lines, god, I miss your style.
Get up, get out
It's no good now.
Light that lighthouse light,
Through telescopic sight, I'm sailing home tonight.

Are we going to make this last?
