There's a feelin'
Little left of heaven
Shook me when you looked my way
Can't believe it
Legs that run forever
Love to know you better
Any time, any place

Fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' under your spell
Callin', callin'
If you leave me lonely
And you take away
The things that I love
Got a bad emotion
Tangled in the web of your love

Hypnotisin'
My temperature's risin'
...
