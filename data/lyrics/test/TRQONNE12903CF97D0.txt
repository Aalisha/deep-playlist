I see the storm is coming
From a hundred ten
Miles in a shade
And the rain keeps failing down
On a summer night parade
I'm asking
Who is gonna do this
Little girl o' mine
I'm not there
When she needed me to stay

I'm praying
Anytime and any day
I said lady
You gave your light away
Anytime and any day
The tears will fall
For my lady

He's a lonesome renegade
