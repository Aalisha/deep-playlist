You say
I do everything the wrong way
Why don't I do it your way?
Then, maybe some day
I'll be just like you

But I say
I'm gonna do it my way
The I-might-fail-but-I'll-try way
Well, that's been done, but it's OK
I'll do what I wanna do

'Cause I don't want to live your dream
I don't want to live your dream
