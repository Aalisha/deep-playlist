God I wish that I could hide away
And find a wall to bang my brains
I'm living in a fantasy, a nightmare dream….reality
People ride about all day
In metal boxes made away
I wish that they would drop the bomb
And kill these cunts that don't belong


I hate people
I hate the human race
I hate people
I hate your ugly face
I hate people
I hate your fucking mess
I hate people
They hate me

My mother thinks that I am a jerk
Because I hate my bleeding work
Be like your daddy he's sincere
But don't be true ……….or you'll be queer
I'm working at my 9 to 5
with boring cunts that give me jibe
