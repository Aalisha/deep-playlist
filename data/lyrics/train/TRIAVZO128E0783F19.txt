The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about

Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight
'till we turn this mother out than apologize after, laughter
Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again

And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you

You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy

The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more
