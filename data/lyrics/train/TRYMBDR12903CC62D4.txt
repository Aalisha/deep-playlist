Got in a little trouble at the county seat

Lawd, they put me in the jail house for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man

He said forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can

Said, that'll be cash on the barrelhead, son

You can take your choice you're twenty-one
No money down, no credit plan
