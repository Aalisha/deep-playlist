I have seen the compass turning
Round and round my heart
The senses are yearning
For a possible change of heart
That is coming to you

You stand upright

Why the spinal shock, the fusion, the evil
Spill it out on the floor of belief
Come and mend this design
Come and mend this design
With every right we do

I have seen the sun, this sounds crazy
The story 'bout boy in the rain
