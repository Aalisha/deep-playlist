I wish I had a heart
I'd call it tiger
And wrapped in silver thread
I'd tie it to my chest
To bring you home

I wish I had a car
And bits of wire
To tie you to the seat
I'd drive you to the beach
And keep on going

And I know when I've been stung
When I'm trapped inside my bed
Feel my flesh begin to swell
i'm an evil shade of red

I hate the taste of skin
It's terrifying
...
