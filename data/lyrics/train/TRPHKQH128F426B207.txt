Replenish what has been taken
Shepherd of the unholy
Blessed are those who guard their soul
Like a shock to the system

Shortage of violence
7 priests involved
Rape of innocent children
Approval from their god

Flesh of the servant
Sexual secrecy
Molestation of those who trust - in this hypocrisy

Kneel down, abuser of the light,
I'm your destiny
...
