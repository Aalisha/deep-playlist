Yaya, yayaya, yayaya, yayaya
Yo, when the long arm of the law
Is grabbing you, backstabbing you
Policecars passing you, on dark avenues
Mag-lights flashing you, pigs harassing you
Breaking you down, smashing you (smashing you)

On the concrete, you find out you can't compete
With the number one thief on the street
I tried to tell you that back, on the biggest hustle track
It's OK to sell crack, if the cops got your back
And they certainly will, if they're on your payoff
They know that if they fuck around, they're getting laid off
And to the cops, to the average citizens, a clean conscience
compared to a steady income, that's nonsense
That's why I stay getting busted for bullshit charges
More than one time, one time, came around
This what went down
När ja å Tommy var i Burlöv, du kommer ihåg, eller hur bög?
-Jorå schlook, vi hade just fotat pieces
Now we're getting fucked by the long dick of the law
Inflict social diseases cause they use no protection
Judge slam the hammer, D.A. got an erection
Wouldn't even give me a public defender
For such a small case, not paying on the trains
Still they wanna four thousand kronors, from my bank account
I thought that was a too big amount
But the judge didn't had no sympathy on me
All on his mind are I committed (unhearable)
But I wasn't fighting - No war (no waaar)
So why they wanna send a mailman with a ticket to mi door -ah to mi doooor
I was only trying to make a wholecar - A wholecar
The Bigfoot beast wanna arrest dej, and put you behind bars -In just a blur, in just a blur
Free Mumia Abu Jamal

(Check it out ya, yayaya)
Yo, when the long arm of the law
