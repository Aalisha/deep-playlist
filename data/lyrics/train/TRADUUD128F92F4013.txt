(one, two, three, four)
Ill be the bumble bee behind you, baby.
I'll tear up everything inside you, well yeah
And it stings, and it stings
Sun shines through your openings
I'll tear up everything insied you

Hold up dont say,
What i think your gonna say
Take your time 'cause i can wait
Its all on you and i'm not sane.
