An unfortunate journey
Through a bleak sea of
loneliness
I carved through the waves
of grief
In a black vastness of self
doubt

I have never felt so alone
So pitiful and wretched
and low
I'm tried by a terrible wind
The misery and the pains
blow

Fill my vast sails of ruin
Steer me toward a bleak end
A horizon of purples and
reds
The still waters of my
welcome end

The clouds of grey come
overhead
A storm will hunt me down
And rip the guts out of my
body
That I would surely drown

The unforgiving wind
...
