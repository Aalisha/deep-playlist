I've got a girl who's oh, so good
She's got everything
I've got a girl and she is mine
She's got everything
Pretty ringlets in her hair
Pretty clothes that she can wear
What's she got?
Everything
Everything
All other guys just stand and stare
She's got everything
I ain't got a dime but she don't care
