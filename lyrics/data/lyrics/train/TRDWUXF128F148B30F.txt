When will it rain, I feel the heat burning through my shoes
Soft shoulders are getting harder adding to my blues
Can't count the days gone by, can't wish away the stain
On the life behind me from which I came

The day is getting longer
The heat is getting hotter
The sun will show no mercy, my nights are spent in vain
I chose this long road and on it I remain
When will it rain

CHORUS
When will it rain
Can't stand this heat from the road, can't stand the pain
When will it rain
It's burning holes in my shoes, won't you tell me
When will it rain
I think I'm going insane
When will it rain
I'm on the road that will never take me home
When will it rain
