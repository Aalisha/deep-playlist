Try, try, try just a little bit harder
So I can love, love, love him, I tell myself
Well, I'm gonna try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I won't lose, lose, lose him to nobody else.
Hey! Well, I don't care how long it's gonna take you now,
But if it's a dream I don't want No I don't really want it
If it's a dream I don't want nobody to wake me.

Yeah, I'm gonna try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can give, give, give, give him every bit of my soul.
Yeah, I'm gonna try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can show, show, show him love with no control.
