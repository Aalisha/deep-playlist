Remember when somebody
Tried to tell you how to walk
And now they got the balls
To tell us how we should talk

Oh no, glove love ain't cool
I must agree
So get outta my face
You ain't got nothing on me

Some say they do
Some say they don't, I take it in stride
And I can never get enough
If I don't got to swallow my pride

I heard it all before and then
She told me, "Gimme some slack"
And then she smiled at me and gave me
The shirt right off her back

And that's when I took advantage of the situation

Don't stop
Rockin' your socks off
Don't stop
Knockin' their blocks off
Don't stop
Gettin' your rocks off

Don't stop
Takin' a hit, boy
Don't stop
Shakin' your fist, boy
Don't stop
...
