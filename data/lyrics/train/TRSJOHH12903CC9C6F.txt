It's pressure, the pleasures measure
The pressure is overbearing
Is it me myself that's caring
For every double-minded joy

And I admit that when I submit to you
I feel so unreal when I'm still
When I'm waiting for you to reveal
And from myself, I seem so far away

And I admit that when I submit to you
I can see all of the selfish things I do

I'm further, further from myself
When I'm next to you, when I run to you
I'm further, further from myself
When I'm next to you, when I run to you
