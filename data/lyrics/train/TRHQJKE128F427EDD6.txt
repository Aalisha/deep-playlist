Weathered sign on the marquee
An old film playing at the show
He could tell by the clouds up top
And old northern was about to blow

So he hopped in his pick-up truck
Steered it on down the road
There he picked up his dark-haired beauty
Drove on down nice and slow, singing

This is my girl
This is my world
This is my girl
This is my world

A lovers' tune on the stereo
Cool breeze blowin' through her hair
He whispers to her soft and low
