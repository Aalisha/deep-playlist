Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby, my heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy
...
