Couple of young girls
Went sailing down on A1A
To the arms of Florida
Sailing down the highway
Singing their heads off
Protected by the Holy Ghost
Flying in from the ocean
Driving with their eyes closed

The night wants to kiss you
Deep and be on his way
Pretend that he don't know you
The very next day
Isn't it hard sometimes?
Isn't it lonely?
I'll still hang around here
There's nothing to hold me

You slide down into the sea
Twelve hours on you feet
...
