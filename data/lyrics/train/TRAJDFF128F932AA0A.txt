City jungle x8

≈Åozina:
Somebody's watching me
I hear them whispers all around
I need to find my love
but what I hear is just weird sounds... (just weird sounds)
Somebody screams (scream)
Some people fight some people run
I need to find my love... (find my love)
But what I hear it just weird sounds
I hear some #%!@'s in my head

City jungle x4

Now am I mad
I think I saw her once or twice
But she's not there any more
Though I won't forget her eyes... (forget her eyes)
Them whispers still in me
...
