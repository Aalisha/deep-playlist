A heart of gold, a new beginning
The greatest gifts you gave to me
You changed the way I live
And said I had so much to give
Opened my eyes to things I couln't see

And all the dreams that you created
were just like wishing on a star
I could look into your eyes
'Cause I've got them memorized
And I'll remember them, no matter where you are

I know that life keeps moving on and on
I know I'll never love this way again
But in my heart I know I must be strong
...
