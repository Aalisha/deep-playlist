Tell me can I get a witness here
Listen up while the music's pumpin'
Come on everybody gather 'round
Tell me what He's done in your life
If you wanna make a difference here
If you're ready to belive in something
Then let me hear you say "Oh"
We know He'll be with us wherever we go
And we're standing here as one I know

We come together
To lift His praises tonight
And when we do
You know we're doing right
Don't make no difference
Where we're coming from
We believe in the Son
And that's what makes us one
...
