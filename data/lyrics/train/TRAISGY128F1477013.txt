Even now in heaven
There were angels carrying savage weapons

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)

Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)

Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

Does our ruin benefit to earth?
Does it help the grass to grow? The sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you too?
Have you'd passed through this night?

Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...(hide, hide...)

Where you're going you're not coming back from
