It's getting cold, it's getting dark and the nights are longer everyday
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away
And we've been waiting here so long that we've forgotten, what it's like
To run into the fire, looking straight into the, straight into the light

Your heart is trying to rock but it can barely beat at all
You're soul is trying to run but all your body does is crawl
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

I wanna tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back
We're tearing down the highway and we're breaking away, breaking away
Breaking away, breaking away from the pack
Breaking away from the pack

And if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on your pedal and you're ready to roll
And even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on your pedal and you're ready to roll
Speed, it's all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know

You and me we're going nowhere slowly
And we gotta get away from the past
There's nothing wrong with going nowhere baby
But we should be going nowhere fast

Everybody's going nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
