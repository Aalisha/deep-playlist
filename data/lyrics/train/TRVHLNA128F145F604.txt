This is the life you saved, laid out before you
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now
Nothing can change the way I feel about you, no
Better we go on our separate ways
Nothing is left but the endless days
Nothing to cry but your name

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair, I will be there for you, I will be there

Maybe this time next year we'll be together
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies
