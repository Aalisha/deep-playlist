Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm fallin' on the ground
How do you hide, how do you hide your love?

Now look here, baby, it sure looks sweet
In the sleep time, out in the street
Why do you hide, why do you hide your love?
Why do you hide, baby, why do you hide your love?

Alright oh
Yeah
