Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumblebee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry?
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusing
You can win when you're losing
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
...
