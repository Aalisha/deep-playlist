The fox went out on a chilly night
He prayed for the moon to give him light
for he'd many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o
He'd many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-o

He ran till he came to the farmers pen
the ducks and the geese were kept therein
He said a couple of you are gonna grease my chin, before I
leave this town-o, town-o, town-o
a couple of you are going to grease my chin before I
leave this town-o
