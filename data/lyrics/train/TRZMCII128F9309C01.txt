In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some of his parts he didn't see
Like scars in a no-man's soul
Their making me so small
Not the shout of a hundred enemies
That making deep fear inside me
But when sun sets and the gold arrives
We'll crush his soul in two, in the darkness of night

he will ride across land and time
to find a way through this endless night
there's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
...
