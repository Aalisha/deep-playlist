If you like to be a jitterbug,
first thing you must do is get a jug
put whisky whine and gin within and shake it all up,
and then begin
grab a cup and start to toss
you are drinkin jittersauce
dont you worry you just mug
and then you'll be a jitterbug

Hear this fat boy blowing his horn?
he's been a bug since the day he was born
his favorite jittersauce is rye
we'll drink it till the day he dies
toot your whistle and ring your bell
ol butchy wutchy time or tell
dont you worry you just mug
you'll always be a jitterbug

these four boys playin saxiphone
...
