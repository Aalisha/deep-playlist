So few words
So few words

We are movin' round to the hour
Force from the power
Thunder reigns down in a mass mind shower
Levellin' vibes unravellin' scribes
Take a venomous sting that's unsettlin'
But consequences awaits me around the corner
Reminiscent of my twistin' fate
All down to the fact it's a hard life
Travel on with the sense of a telling adventure
So as I wait for the opportune time to create
Soul energy that will then enable me to realise
Analyse all aspect of man-made decision
The vision the many ways
Wrong turn right, right turn... left
Ain't no way back straight ahead along track
Counteract react higher pace embrace
...
