In my eyes you'll see,
the way it used to be
Take a look and see
the light still shines in me

In My Eyes

In my eyes you'll see,
the way it used to be
Take a look and see
the light still shines in me

There's a part of me
that I forgot to be
Take a look and see
the light still shines in me

Take a look and see
the light still shines in me
(2x)
