I know this makes no sense
I'm going to try to explain
All that you're feeling
To try to unlock your pain
And I beg forgiveness
If that's what it takes
Or has all this been wasted?

Cause yesterday was good
But yesterday is gone
Everything I said
It always took too long

And I broke all my promises
So easy
And I broke all my promises
So easy
And that's just not enough

Everything I did
Ended up so wrong
Everything I made
Never lasted long
Everything I did
Ended up so wrong
Everything I made
Never lasted long
...
