I got a place that I like to slip off to
When everything starts closin' in
And I got some ways that the world don't agree with
Yeah some folks would call it a sin
But I work like a dog and I'm good at my job
And I live for a one-day weekend
So I'm takin' off and I might stay a week
Hell I may never come back again

CHORUS 1: I need a breather, a sweet senorita
Writin' my name in the sand
I need a break from this job and this angry boss man
Some coconut lotion, a chair by the ocean
...
