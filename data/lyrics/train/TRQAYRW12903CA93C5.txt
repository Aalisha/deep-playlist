[Hook]
She's callin me on my phone
Tellin me, she's feelin freaky
Her body's in need of me
Ya'll know player's get Jones
So, if you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me

[Skillz]
Her body's feelin freaky
She calls me when she needs me
She can't wait to please me
I don't need you to believe me
I'm not her man or lover
We understand each other
It's somethin bout the cover
We always usin rubber
