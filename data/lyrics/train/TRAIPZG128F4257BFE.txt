I can tell by the way you've been yelling her name
That it's more than a friendly game
With a smile and a "I'm gonna fight to the death" expression in her eye
You think I'm so dramatic;
Just imagining again
You come to her defence
Insisting that she's innocent
Well excuse me for wanting to be
The one and only lock that fits your key
Oh you believe there's nothing up her sleeve
Oh baby, well just wait and see

You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes
She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

Take a minute to see it from my side of things
Don't you think you would feel the same?
