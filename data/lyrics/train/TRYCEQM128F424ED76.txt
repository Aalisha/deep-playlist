As I was walking out of class
The other day at school
I saw you
Don't
think I've ever seen you
'Round here before
You must be new
What's
your name? Where are you from?
Our conversation's just begun
Maybe we can
talk more after school
I know that we just met but maybe
You'd like to
let me
Go out with you

I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I
wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with
you
