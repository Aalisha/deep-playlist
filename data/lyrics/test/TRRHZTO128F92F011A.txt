Maybe I give up too easy
Maybe I don't fight enough
Maybe my heart is afraid of falling in love

Maybe I'm too scared to find out
What it feels like to hurt
Maybe I worry, I'll land with my face in the dirt

But if I don't try, I won't know
These walls that surround me, they're strong and they're tall
I could slip and fall with no one to catch me at all
