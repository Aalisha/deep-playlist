That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
I've got those icy, icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

That same old tingle I feel inside
And then that elevator starts it's ride
And down and down I go, all around I go
Like a leaf that's caught in a tide

Well, I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
...
