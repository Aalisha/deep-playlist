Two a.m. with the lost and the lonely
Walkin' past the kids, comin' back from the party
Smiles on their faces, you remember so well how it was
Nights in the back of that buick that you got runnin'
Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'


Chorus:


Work so hard to do what is right
Believed in what you're doin',
But so many fights
Trusted too many, believed too much,
Workin' your life to the bone


There's a wolf at your door,
He wants your money, wants your soul
A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more
...
