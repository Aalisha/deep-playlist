Wise man he says "I'm a treat you like you wanted".
Foolish man says "I'm a treat you like I want to".
Evil you spread now is gonna come right back,
come right back and haunt you.
Love that you share now,
it will guide and protect you.
Guide and protect you.

Met a policeman, said he was a soldier.
Told me to get out of his face and hit the road ya.
But see I don't need me no army 'cause I don't want no fight.
But I'm a stand up for the difference between wrong and right.
