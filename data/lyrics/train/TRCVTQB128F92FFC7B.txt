Im tired and im reckless and i cant go home
(cant go home)
Im useless and regretfull theres no where to go
(no where to go)
i am lonley and and i notice stuff is nothing just to show it

open your arms here i come
it takes more to stick together
and i never meant to make you cry
acting like your perfect
everything was worth it
still all along to lived a lie

and i know you knew baby
that i know the lady's going out with other guys
acting like your perfect
acting like your worth it
all you ever did was pray for guys
and you think that he will call you back

Im tired and im reckless and i cant go home
(cant go home)
Im useless and regretfull theres no where to go
(no where to go)
i am lonley and and i notice stuff is nothing just to show it
open your arms here i come
