We rode in the morning
Casablanca to the west
On the Atlas mountain foothills leading down to Marrakesh
For Mohammed and Morocco
We had taken up our guns
For the ashes of our fathers and the children of our sons
For the ashes of our fathers and the children of our sons

We were sharpening the blades
We were riding to act upon the promise we had made
With the fist and the dagger
with the rifle and and the lance
We will suffer no intrusion from the infidels of France
