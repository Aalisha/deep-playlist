[Chorus:]
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's not feeling good, then say no
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's feeling good to ya, say yes
If it's not feeling good, then say no

Listen, tonight it's not about me, it's you
Whatever you wanna do
Your wish is my command
(Your wish is my, your wish is my command)
