Hey hey hey Mr. Hangman,
Go get your rope

Your daughters weren't careful,
I fear that I am a slippery slope
Now even if I lay my head down at night
After a day I got perfectly right

She won't know...
She won't know...
She won't know...

So pray little Kay, loves God on a good day
And you can't blame your mother
She's trying not to see you as her worst mistake
And I wish that I could tell you right now (I love you)
But it looks like I won't be around
So you won't know
You won't know
You won't know
...
