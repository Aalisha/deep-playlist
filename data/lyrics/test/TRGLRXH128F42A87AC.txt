Push the button if you feel okay
Then you can finally get in
I'm really happy that you found the way
'Cause everybody loves Berlin

Left-hand is heaven
And right is hell
Riding this roller-coaster
Up and down, up again

Refrain:
Sweet sensation
Turn me upside down
Flying with a fascinating charm
Time runs backwards as the night
