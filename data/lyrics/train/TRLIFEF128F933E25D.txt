Here come old flat top, he come grooving up slowly
He's got joo joo eye balls, he want holy roller
He's got hair down to his knees
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoe shine, he's got toe jam football
He's got monkey fingers, he shoot Coca Cola
He says, 'I know you, you know me'
