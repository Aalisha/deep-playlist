Right, right
Girl, I know what you're thinking
You need some answers in your heart tonight
Girl, I'm here, let's make it different
Ease the pressure, sweeten up your life
Gonna let your hair down
Gonna let your guard down
Gonna let me show you
Everything you've been missing
Gonna let it all go
Girl, you gotta let it flow
Don't let the door close
I know what can get you better
You need some sugar
You're only human, baby
Let me bring it on to you tonight
I'll be your sugar
I'm gonna make it easy
Smooth it out and make you feel so right
Right, right
