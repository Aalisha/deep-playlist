Went to bed as the sun rose
Woke up this morning in yesterday's clothes
Up all night, sharing a secret
You're on a promise and I'm gonna keep it
Unplug the alarm or at least press reset
There's no way I'm getting up yet

Just another five, another five minutes
That train's gone and we're not in it
My heart can't take the strain
Give me thirty minutes and we'll blame it on the

When we get there, no one will know
We didn't wash and slept in our clothes
...
