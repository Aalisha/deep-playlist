Written by toni braxton, keri lewis

Santa, please, will you help me
'cause I'm all alone with my christmas tree...
See, my honey's on his way, his flight's delayed
Can you bring him on your sleigh?
'cause time is going

Slowly dragging me along...
Santa, please bring my man home...

Santa, please, will you help me
'cause I'm all alone and so unhappy...
...
