Everybody listen up 'cause I'm about to give my speak on
Fools be trippin' when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin' round town, puttin' it down
Without no protection, funny erection
When it's time for selection, what's your direction?
Before you make a choice you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game
Then let me explain now
Aisha slept wit' Mark and Mark slept wit' Tina
And Tina slept wit' Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit' Loopy and Loopy slept wit' Rob
'Cause he was rollin' on beeds and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit' Lisa who slept wit' Steve and Steve was positive H.I.V.
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
You betta cool your ass off 'cause it's too damn hot
Oh oh, it's too hot
(Too hot)
Too hot, lady
(Too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run out for shade
It's too hot
(Too hot)
Too hot, homie
(Too hot)
Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made
You're doin' everything momma told you not to do
Now you're tryin' to walk away 'cause you know it's true
Your sister can't explain and your mother's ashamed
To admit you both had the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
'Cause the matches in your purse say 'Holiday Inn'
