I see them linin up to howl at the moon
Singin Wonderwall out of tune
Wasn't an unusual sight
It's any town on any given Saturday night
You'll see 'em prowlin in a pack for a fight
And his hairy hand's enough to give a brother a fright
Turned to me and asked me what my problem was
Then jumped around and smacked me bang across my head because
I wasn't wearin a white shirt that looked like his
Didn't go to the disco to swing my fists
Or I don't know maybe it wasn't the clothes
I haven't got a monobrow or an Elastoplast across my nose
I wasn't doin all the things he do
I was mindin my own business with a drink or two
Still he's gotta come and misbehave
After seven drinks the creature's risen from the grave

Strange transformations
Happen after midnight across the nation
Yeah we all enjoy a drink or two
But why they gotta do the things they do?
And if you don't believe in Jekyll and Hyde
You gotta go the horrorshow they're shootin outside
