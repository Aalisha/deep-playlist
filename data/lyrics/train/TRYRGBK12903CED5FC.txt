I can remember all the times I tried to tell you
Just what was on my mind
But I couldn't find the words to say

I'm so confused by the thought
Of you and me together
And I'm afraid you might not feel the same

Even if you did, would it change everything?
And we could try but maybe it's not meant to be

Oh, what if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about?
What if, what if? What if, what if? What if, what if?

What if we fail?
What if, what if it doesn't work out?
What if, what if thinking about
What do we do when all breaks down?

Now I don't know where to go and who to turn to
