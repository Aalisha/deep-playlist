When the lights gone out and the food run out
all we have is just the music
when the lights gone out and the food run out
all we have is just the music

A battery tape playing in the street
my only relief
all we have is just the music

No matter what the crisis
it keep the spirit lively
just as you feeling blue
well I'll be there for you

When the lights gone out and the food run out
all we have is just the music
when the lights gone out and the food run out
all we have is just the music

Pretty girls dance in the street
my only relief
all we have is just the music
...
