I believe in my baby
Our love will always be (I believe in my baby)
I believe in my baby (ah yeah)
Our love will always be, yeah yeah yeah (say it, say it, say it again)

Now here come to me
Just when I thought
That no one had no kind of love for me
My achin heart was restless
Hopelessly decieved
You came along and made it
Easy to believe
In love again

I believe in my baby (ah yeah)
Our love will always be (say it again)
I believe in my baby

Arms of an angel
Shield me with protection
And you show me that you care
I say it loud and proud
