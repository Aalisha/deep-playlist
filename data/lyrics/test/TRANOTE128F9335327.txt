fall in the sizzle of a blackened sea
get loose get juiced get pumped
crawl in the riddle that becomes routine
get ripped get pissed get crunk
rocked in a little and you self-esteem
get high and try a ton
card in the middle of a magazine
get lit get hit get drunk
lied to the middle of everything you'd be
no sight what's right at all
slide into livin someone else's scheme
tonight you fight you fall
...
