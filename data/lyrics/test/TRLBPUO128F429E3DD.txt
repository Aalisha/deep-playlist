Lawd-a-mercy
No big deal, no big deal
Guy can't hear him gonna feel
Gwan like him head and him chest must a mek outta steel
Black Talon a chop down dem shield

Bwoy run come up inna me Magnum bwoy
Stand up in front me shotgun bwoy
Disrespect Miss Ivy last son
And yuh life disappear
A no warn me no warn dem and
A no tell me no tell dem
If dem diss Waterhouse man dem inna problem
And me gun nah spare dem, Bwoy

Talk until diss yuh gun inna me hand get ill
and start kill, bwoy
Oonu diss man from Rockfort, Southside, and Shooters Hill
Never stop til now,
Oonu diss man from Waterhouse, Seaview, and from Mandeville
Never stop til,
Yuh go diss man from Walton, Backto and Warika Hill
? ghost we kill
Bwoy blood fi spill

Lawd-a-mercy Bwoy,

Run come up inna me Magnum bwoy
Stand up in front me shotgun bwoy
Disrespect Miss Ivy last son
And yuh life disappear, same place
...
