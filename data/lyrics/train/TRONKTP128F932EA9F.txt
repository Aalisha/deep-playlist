Dressed in black he walks alone, a shadow in the night
Each time he walks by my window
Can't hold the tears from my eyes
We're still so much in love, why can't they realize?
That every time he looks at me I long to feel his lips on mine
I live on just the memory of him caressing me
So soft, so warm, so soft, so warm
