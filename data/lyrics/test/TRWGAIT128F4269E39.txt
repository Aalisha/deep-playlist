From old Montana down to Alabam I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town
[ guitar ]
Well hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is doin' me right
