sunshine, goodbye

she was lovely give her back
so damn lovely i want her back

woke up this morning
kicked in the door
door to the world
war on the world
it's time to make them see
time to make them plead
i'm gonna claw the open sore until it starts to bleed

she was lovely give her back
so damn lovely i want her the way she used to be
