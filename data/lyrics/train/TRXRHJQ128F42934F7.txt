There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me

Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name

And there goes your paralyzin' eyes
...
