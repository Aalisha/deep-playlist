There was this empty shell,
and I called it my life.
sometimes it felt like hell,
but it was easy to survive.

time was like a drain,
that didn't flush me down.
there was no room for pain,
and not one chance to drown.

I want to cut off all my ties,
I need to break through all the ice.
I want it to evaporate,
and cease to be a surrogate.

I want to raise a thunderstorm.
I want to bring down all the rain.
I want to be the flood that cleans.
