I am the one of battles reason
I left this world my mothers corpse
I am the eyes and heart of treason
My lullabye the screams of horse
I am the haunting and the hurting
I read the walls of memory
I am the fist in the face of glory
I grow and my fire with me

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

I am the incarnation of all ages
I've seen it all & of reason
Some of you may trust in me
