No Hiding Place

Hi hottie!
What you are doing?
I want talking the reason...

There's a look into your eyes
It's not to my surprise
That you are lonely girl, yeah
But I listen to the street
I see that you're so wick
It's in your heart, oh yeah

All you can show your pretty smile behind the tears
That's on your face
But you can run, you can run, you can run, you can run,
But there's no hiding place, oh yeh

As you standing in that room
I see the lonely group
Shows on your face, yeah
I want see your smile
The light of your face
Don't let the worry turn you around
Turn you around, turn you around, turn you around,

As you can see a pretty smile that's on my face
A girl smile, oh, oh, oh girl
