What love can do
What love can do

I'm losing sleep over you
Look what you've done to me
Not saying you ain't the truth
This love's no fantasy

Sometimes I'm so sick of you
I need some therapy
Just like an addict on you
Making no recovery

So should I stay, should I go
Do I do, do I don't
Will I will, will I won't
Do like my momma told me

That's what love can do
Now I know
Everything just ain't good for you
Said I'm feeling like a fool, a fool

It's got me so confused
Oh, baby
Maybe that's just what love can do
Love can do, what love can do

See you sweep me off my feet
