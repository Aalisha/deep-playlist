Ooh, hoo, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Let me be the clock for the time of your life, oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time

I'm a cuckoo I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hopin', hopin' that you

Will let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah, babe
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, let it begin

'Cause every moment we're apart is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me, told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now
