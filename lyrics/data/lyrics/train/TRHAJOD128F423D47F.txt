Death by chocolate is myth, yeah yeah
This I know because I lived, oh
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl, this is only right now

And death by crying doesn't exist, oh
Though the headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode but you reach the end of the road
And you little tree, I'm certain you will grow

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return
...
