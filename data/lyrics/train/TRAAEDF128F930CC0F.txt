Let's all raise a glass to the rock stars of the past
Those that made it, those that faded
Those that never even made the grade
Those that we thought would never last
Singers come and go and stars fade away
They vanish in the haze and they're never seen again
But the music just keeps playing on
They can't stop the music
They can't stop the music
They can't stop the music playing on
I've been half a million places
