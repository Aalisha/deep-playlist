Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street
Well the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth

My name is Brody I'm from Melbourne
Fitzroy Melbourne Fitzroy Melbourne
I grew up on Bell St. then on Bennett St.
My mum kicked out my dad for battery
Found a way... she found a way
She found a way out of spiritual penury
Working single mother in an urban struggle
Blames herself now cause I grew up troubled
It hit me I got everything I need (x2)
