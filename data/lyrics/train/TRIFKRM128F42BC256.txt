Now even though I was only a young buck, I was still trying to kick it
Having a gang of fun and much too young to be wicked
'Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars
It was either double ride the peg nuts or hop on the handle bars

And then we went and bought a gang of balloons
And had a water balloon fight that lasted until the night
Then after that we played some hide and go get it
With the neighborhood home girls, dumb enough to be with it

All in fun and games and keeping it cool
But my my, when you're kicking it, time flys by
'Cause every hour's a minute and every minute's a sec
And if I came home late my moms would ring my neck, yeah

But I regret not the whoopings I got
'Cause to be able to play the next day was okay
On a mission to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees
Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze

Summer breeze, flowing like the wind
Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here
Summer breeze, flowing like the wind
Boy you need to know that you got a friend and I'll always be here

Now I'm growing some fuzz, getting older like 17 or 18
And the only thing I know is to stay clean
T-shirt, short pants, Nike's on spotless
I was even old enough to buy me a cutlass
