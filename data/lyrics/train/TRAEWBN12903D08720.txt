Whispering our goodbyes
Waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby
In the summer rain
I can hear him saying:
"Nothing will change,
come dance with me baby
in the summer rain"

I remember the rain on his skin
And his kisses hotter than the San An winds
Whispering our goodbyes
Waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby
In the summer rain
I remember laughing till we almost cried
There at the station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

Oh my love its you that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
...
