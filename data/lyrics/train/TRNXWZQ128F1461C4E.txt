She sleeps with the moonlight under her head
And the stars to keep her warm
Far from the noise and the world below
She comes to me in my dreams like a love song
And I awake only to hear her go

Somewhere along the way I lost the melody
And I don't want the birds to sing, sing it to me

'Cause I love to hate the feeling
Don't wanna deal with the morning after
What can I say to keep it down?
What can I say to keep it down?
What can I say to keep your love around me?

She walks with me on frozen stone, ever so lightly
