i don't know what you're looking for
but it's a waste of time
i can't take it anymore
not a second time

girl you've got to stand up
and tell me what i'm doing wrong
i say you've got to stand up
and tell me what i'm doing wrong

baby can you hear me
i can't reach your mind
i want you near me baby all the time
it should be easy
well, it never is with you, baby

i don't know what you're looking for
...
