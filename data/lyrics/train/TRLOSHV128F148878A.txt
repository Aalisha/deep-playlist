One foot in and one foot out
I'm up for grabs, my future's in doubt
No more runnin round and playin this game
It's time for me to make a stand for your name

Enough, nuff, enough is enough
No more white lies it's time to hang tough
Enough, nuff, Enough is enough
No more foolin with compromise. No No No
