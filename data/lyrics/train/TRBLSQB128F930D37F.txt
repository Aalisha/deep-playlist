See the gun high velocity
Levelled to my heart
Magazine filled with hollow points
Bullets invented to slaughter
They activate the trigger
I get fired to the wall
Pain is pungent stops my life
Hear the last bell toll

Tired and red the ways I gonna die
Tired and red squirm, to plead to dry
Tired and red confirm by oath the death
Tired and red to my last breath
