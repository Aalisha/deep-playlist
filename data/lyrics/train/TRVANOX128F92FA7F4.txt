As high as the moon, so high were my spirits
When you sang out my name
And comin' from you it was enough just to hear it
Oh, it rang like the bells did today

But even the sturdiest ground
Can shift and can tremble and let us fall down

Kindly unspoken, you showed your emotion
And silence speaks louder than words, oh
It's lucky I'm clever, if I didn't know better
I'd believe only that which I'd heard
