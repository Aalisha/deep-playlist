"Slinky Chinese
Slinky violence"

"Mister Wu no longer has a laundry
Sad to say the business was a flop"

Chinatown Friday night
The weekend is alright
Dragon dance the yellow streets
Gambling dens and sour sweet

Neon signs inside of my head
Better thought and never said
As long as I don't get too close
And I don't offend my hosts

No way out on Gerrard Street
Dragon's heart begins to beat
If this night could last all day
Order you and take away

At this corner we must part
Say goodnight where Soho starts
...
