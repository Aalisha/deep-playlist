Did anybody hear that
There's a string that just broken my heart
I can feel it
And the sound of it tears me apart
Play it again
Cause I don't recognize this song anymore
Can you make it sound like it did before?

It's the same old melody
And I can't stand what you do to me
Why you keep strummin' on the strings of my heart?
It beats like a timpani
But you stole that away from me
I should've known it right from the start
(Oh baby)

All I know is I don't wanna hurt no more
All I know is this song needs a different chord
Cause theres so many times that I feel like we've been hit before
I stay crying when you walk out the door
I hear a sad, sad symphony (So that the strings cry)
A sad, sad symphony (So that the strings cry)
It's like a sad, sad symphony (So that the strings cry)
