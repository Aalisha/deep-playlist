Kiss all your saviors goodbye
Offer them up to the dead
No kidding you know who's right
And whose got a price on their head

No doubt I'd sell you all out
For a pocket full of silver and gold
Way back when, when they made me one of them

Don't you know they're gonna' save my soul

I can't hang around with you like this my friend
Our time has come to an end
