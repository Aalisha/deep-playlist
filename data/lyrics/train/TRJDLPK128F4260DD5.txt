Cryptic words meander 
Now there is a song beneath the song 
One day you'll learn 
You'll soon discern its true meaning 
An interesting detachment 
A listless poem of love sincere 
Desire, despair 
Overlapping melodies 

And it's not a love, it's not a love 
It's not a love, it's not a love song 
...
