You can hide in my arms
if the Sky unleashes his fury
for He's betrayed
in your heart lays my sight
for all the things
I've searched and looked for...
My end belongs to your beginning
my death will follow your blossom
my eyes will seek your hands forever
Oh thou, pale tulip of mine

"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
...
