Mother
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker
They left me broken, bleeding
Son of
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch
Who tried to show me death's door

Everything's eliminated
Everything is dedicated
Tried to leave this life I hated
Living it was overrated

Love song for the dear departed
Headstone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
More flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

Acid
Obituaries rain down
...
