Every time it rains I listen to the sky
I wonder what's so great about sunshine
So everybody lives and everybody dies
And no one's gonna love you like I do
(when it was getting dark
I didn't need a match
I never need a light to see you
You thought I'd disappear but
I was always here, oh
I could never get that far from you, though)
I misunderstand
And been misunderstood
Love me cause you can and
Not because you should

Every time it rains
I know it's good to be alive
