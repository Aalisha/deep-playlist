A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of booze
A little bit of me
And a little bit of you
A little bit country
A little bit of blues
A little slice of heaven
And a little piece of you... Come on

Alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass
Alcohaulin' ass

A little bit thirsty
A little bit used
...
