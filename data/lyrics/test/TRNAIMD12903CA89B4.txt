"This is the place where stars are born" - MC Shan
"And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin" - MC Lyte
The big city of dreams, feel pity for fiends
Gritty shifty in schemes, pretty shitty it seems
But we walkin on the gold mine, lovin this place
Ace, Babu, Coalmine, up in your face
Along with - introducin Bekay on the mic
I stare right at Flatbush Ave when I'm prayin at night
Some pack gats, leavin other cats blasted
And even the white chicks be rockin fat asses
Always hot, not just when the summer here
Coney Island cyclonin it, or jumpin on the wonder wheel
Fiends on the floor look for crack 'til they knees break
Or Puff could be a dick and make you walk here for cheesecake
Ain't no war, but we rock camouflauge
Ridin bikes, one on the pegs and one up on the handlebars
If you poppin shit y'all kids is just hatin
On the home of Biggie Smalls and the original Nathan's
Go door to door, see we more than sorta raw
