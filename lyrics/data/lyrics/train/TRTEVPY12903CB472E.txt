I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go my roamin' mind told me that's so
How I wish that we were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelin' and a livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I can still recall the wheatfields near St. Paul
