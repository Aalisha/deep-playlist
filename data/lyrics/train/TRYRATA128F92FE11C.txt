Tuck it in or take it out for what
You cannot see with them eyes
A tired hand, her naked hand, putting me to sleep

It won't be long, your glow
Has left me dry and my abstinence has been
Postponed by my comfort in denial

And the worst lie it may be (that hope said)
She'd be the last one to leave

Always close now sense it clear
...
