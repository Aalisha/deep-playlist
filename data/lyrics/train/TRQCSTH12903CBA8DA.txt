Everybody knows you've been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
You keep a steppin' out of line and messin' with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now, you better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
