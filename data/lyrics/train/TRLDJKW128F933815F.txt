Little boy blue, please come blow your horn
Little boy blue, please come blow your horn
My baby, she gone an' left me
She left me all alone

Now, the sheep's is in the meadow
An' the cow's is in the corn
I've got a girl in Chicago, she loves to hear me
Blow my lonesome horn

Little boy blue
Please come blow your horn
My baby, she gone an left me
