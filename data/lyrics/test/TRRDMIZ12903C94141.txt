Okay, okay
Boyz N Da Hood
Yo let's go
Smoke sum, smoke sum
Let's ride, ay, let's ride, a, let's ride, yo
Well, even though you look good 2night
Ay, we gona keep it in da hood 2nite, in da hood 2night
And we can ride in whateva you like
But we gonna keep it in da hood 2night, in da hood 2night
Being on da ice and don't forget da dice
Ay, we gonna keep it in da hood 2night, in da hood 2night
Whateva we doin' we doin' it right
But we gonna keep it in da hood 2night, in da hood 2night
Ya now 2night we gonna keep the G from my fokes
Dick is a wife beata, plus a peace in da holster
I see da feirce, so I polster the polster
They see me showin' love to young gig and sosa
But it's all propa, ain't no bail hoppas
See a bunch of young gangstas so they wanna stop us
'Cuz we block hoppas, plus we cop droppas
By the day but the night we just cock roppas
Tryin' to catch a dime, cat nights and fat
Let's go get they hair right like a fitted hat
I ain't 'bout to spend a dime unless I get it back
Now you monkey niggaz tell me how real iz dat?
