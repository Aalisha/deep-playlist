I can't take it anymore
I hate to see that people get chased away
Just because of their sense of style
I can't take it anymore
Everyone is unique in their own way

I can't take it anymore
We all have the right to choose
I can't take it anymore
Everyone has the right to be, who they want

We don't need no more bloodshed
End all sickness tonight
We don't need no hate or anger
Burn your hate inside
And I demand more respect for everyone
...
