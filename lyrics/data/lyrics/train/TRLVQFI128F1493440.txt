You can't tell me that the stars wont come out at night
No, you can't tell me that the sun will refuse to shine
There's nothing you can say or do that will destroy my peace of mind
I've tried God for myself and he's with me every time

You can't tell me that the doctors have the final say
No, you can't tell me that the Lord wont make a way
There's nothing you can say or do that will take away my faith
Ever since I tried the Lord nothing can take his place

I know too much about him
And there's nothing to make me doubt him
Just as sure as I have life, oh, you can't change my mind
Oh you can't tell me nothing, cause I know God for myself
