Babygirl what's your name cause I like
No I don't have a girl I'm so trife
She's probably at the crib being a good wife
Without a clue that I'm coming to you tonight
She told me if I ever sneak she'd know
But she doesn't even know where I go
So like a fool to please my ego
I knocked her down like Roy Jones body blow

She'd layed it on me vicious no what I mean
Then granted me 3 wishes now see
I don't want my girl to know where we be and
I don't want you to rock with nobody but me and
for my last wish I want to know what the red
light blinking is behind thoses blinds
She taped the whole thing and sent it to my girl
I'm Karma vingence is mine

K A R M A
Everything about her comes back around
K A R M A
Everything you do will find you somehow
K A R M A
On the card she left me was her name
K A R M A
Could be settleing your score today

Two weeks later I met this guy drinking
