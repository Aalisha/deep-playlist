There is a darkness to these jaded days
Maybe it's a seasonal affected disorder
Or maybe we're just sad
There is photosynthesis
We crane our necks for sunlight
There's a different sun for everyone

And it's bigger than me, this sun is bigger
Yeah it's bigger than me, this sun is bigger
So much more to eat, this sun is bigger
To be bigger than me, this sun is bigger

There is a vacuum
There are boys with toys
These toys of coldness
And a smart arse
