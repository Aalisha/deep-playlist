It's a dead world...
And it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! don't give up!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
Cause they don't understand!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do?
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
Pow! we're on the move! resist worldwide!
Cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure -
We're gonna take over!
Radical! terrorize! and I'm not gonna tell you lies!
