How does it feel, what do you do
When he's all alone with you
Do you kiss him, hold his hand
Who's the woman who's the man

Is it twisted it is sick
Mother nature's little trick
I don't have to feel no shame
In God's image I am made

Your brother doesn't understand
How you could love another man
Your poor father thinks we're cursed
It's the same thing in reverse

It's the same thing in reverse
Nothing better nothing worse
It's the same thing in reverse
It's the same thing it's the same thing
