Get into this moment, it won't get to you
Well are you in or are you out?
Keep a little composure when the walls come down
Well, are you in? I hope your in

And oh, you know this place will look so much better when its broken
And oh, I hope, we all trust your decision is the right one

Sharpen your eyes
Never leave this house alone
Get up, get up and stand your ground
