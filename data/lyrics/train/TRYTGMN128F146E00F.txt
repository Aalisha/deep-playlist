VERSE 1
L.A. is the place to be and if it ain't as shocking as it used to be
take the bullet out your head, put it back in the gun get your finger on the trigger

VERSE 2
Welcome everybody to the city of sound
they feast on your fears to turn the city around
all they want to do is get up on your action... let em go

CHORUS
My brothers are all proud rockers... wild and aloof... trippin on acid
My sisters are all stone studders... wired to the roof... and rolling on adam

VERSE 3
Baby you live like a suicide
Hell, somebody's gotta stand up and die

Won't ya, figure i'd live down in Hollywood, never liked no fraud who
wear his money for food for fifteen minute freaks, to fan the flannel flame... Cuz they use you man!
