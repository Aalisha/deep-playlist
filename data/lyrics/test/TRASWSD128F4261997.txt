War of the replicants
Dawn of the predators
Perilous
Puffing on the tusk of an Elephant
Walk with a swagger
Talk with some venomous grammar
More heavy than Gabba
View gamma eye
Hands on the hammer right
Into the night kitchin
Cookin' up with my sex kitten
Hooking up with the next vixen
And believe me she's a vision of exquisite physical condition
Put her in a difficult position
Take a break, break a branch off for a little intermission
Now let me build and burn silver birch
Milk the Earth fill my purse like the Bilderbergs
Curse my circumstance
I crave nature
Live like Rasta, move to Jamaica
Waiting for the day that Asaviour buys karakoo(?)
Could your lame clan coming through with that bag of loot
Puffin' sag aloo with my aggy crew
My bad attitude got me this far
What you wanna do?
