You hear me talkin', you know I'm from the O A K
I tell it like it is and that's the only way
I'm the M, the A, the C, the K
I write my rhymes everyday

Now, all you one-rap rappers, what are you doin'?
I got so many raps, so just go right through 'em
My name is Short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic, I do it all the time

Now, could you be like me? I hate to say it
It's like comparin' Mickey D's and Quick Ways
You only got 3 stores, I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl

But I'm such a dog, I never call the freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things, the candy paints
Got her sprung on my diamond rings

She could live like a queen if she was Miss Too Short
Have two babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nothin' from me
I ain't fakin' it freak, I'm just makin' the beat
