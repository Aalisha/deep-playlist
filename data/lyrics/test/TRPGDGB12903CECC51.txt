I've been looking for you, baby
Anywhere that I can find
And I was searching for your sweet name
Cause you never left my mind
I've been on the Altavista
I went twice on the Yahoo
And everywhere I go,
there is always a clue,
always something about you that may help me get my hands on you

like
It's your birthday tomorrow
but you're not getting anything you know
It's your birthday tomorrow
...
