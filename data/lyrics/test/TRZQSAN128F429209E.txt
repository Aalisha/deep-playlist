I am your poison candygram
The love that's meant to fade away
Vade retro, alter ego, move aside, I'm choking on this life
I think I tolerate your hate, as long as you're afraid
All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day

Under the moon I hold a wake for a promise torn
Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me
Once again my shadow will enter your life
Could I let you wait out the night

Mother always said "my son, do the noble thing"
You have to finish what you started, no matter what
Now, sit, watch and learn
"It's not how long you live, but what your morals say"

Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word
Don't say a word
It won't be long now, love, like mist I slowly fill the room

I place a black candle on your chest
