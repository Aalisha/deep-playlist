I just heard a plane
Fly over my place
Say that magic word
And take me far away

Maybe somewhere with rain
And an easier pace
A place with nothing due
Just me and you

Hey hey
Come on you know we gotta let go
Hey, hey
I wanna ride high
Come out and play

Won't stop until we blow the world away
Hold on tight baby lets fly to the moon tonight
Hey hey
