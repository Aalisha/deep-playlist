Nobody know how to tie the simple knots that I know
Getting weak in the knees and your bruises are beginning to show
The only way she knows how to take it is blow by blow
Strapped to the rack with a slap on the ass should make her eyes glow

I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose lip talking jockey with a whip and track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talking cause I get what I go after

Where, where there's a whip there's a way
I'm gonna tighten up the slack in your chains
Where, where there's a whip there's a way
