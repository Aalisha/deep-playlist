Deatholution
Return to primeval mud
When the S turns the C
WeÂ’re suffering in blood
And lose all humanity
Stumble over the screens
People without sanity speak with primordial screams
New act of Discovery

The deatholution begins
Spreading out like a virus
Realeased from all our sins
Destroy us

Deatholution
