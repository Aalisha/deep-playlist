When the pain starts to hurt
The fire inside starts to burn
Now without self-control
Look down deep in your soul
Tainted black from your hate
The future you can't escape
Slithering in the filth
Everday is the same
Feel the rope, nice and tight
No is no one left to blame
Tie the rope, around your neck
Mind insane, life's a wreck
Reach the point of no return
...
