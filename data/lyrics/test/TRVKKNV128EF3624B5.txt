[...I think underground is
whatever, your mood or your feelings might be at the time
So long as it's the truth... truth... truth...]

Verse One:

I could tell the pimped-est story
About street homicide, and make it sound gory
Cause you know, shit be happenin everyday
And then on the weekends twice as much shit comes into play
So I better watch my back or
I might get caught up, in a fuckin crack war
So I use the back door, cause the front ain't safe
Seven different brothers got stuck and I don't wanna be the
eighth
Don't make no sense
Walkin through my own neighborhood I feel tense
Don't wanna carry no gun
Cause the cops be stoppin us, and pattin us down just for fun
So, the only protection I got
Is my smitties, but how many kids get shot
Fuckin that throw up your hands shit
And fight like a man but he don't get to land shit
Not one punch, the only hit
Was when his head hit the concrete, got knocked clean off his
feet
Got a lot of blood on they shoes
But they got that Rolex, and jumped in the cruise
...
