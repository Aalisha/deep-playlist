Have you heard about my screams
Cause I like a drink
And I haven't touched one in weeks
Can the blind see through the eyes
Of a dog or is it just attention I seek
Have you ever known it to be
Because I know you're warming to me
And I know you're waiting you're always ready
You keep your mouth in your backside baby
And you're using it daily in my defense
You wear the devil in your shoes lately
