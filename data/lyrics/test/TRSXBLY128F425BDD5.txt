With a little bit of gold and a pager
(repeat)

Cool Kids
Cool Kids
Yup!
Uh...

Pedal down the foothills, wheelies on the front (for real Chuck?)
Not for play homebro, I made those in those
I skate those in these
I take dough and wear em like I made those even if I don't 'cause oh
I'll take those like dat (uh)
Put em in my napsack, snap the top latch
Four finger ring on my belt buckle strap
Gotta hold up my jeans 'cause they fallin off my ass
...
