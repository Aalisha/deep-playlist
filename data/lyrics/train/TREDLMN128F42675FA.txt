Tough times ahead of me
Tough times behind
I fight for my life, I fight till I die
I fight to save my mind
It's justified violence
It burns from within
Sometimes a man must fight
It's not always a sin
It's not a sin!
Justified violence
Justified violence!
An innocent victim becomes the pun,
hat thriving fools in search of some fun
It's not fun to fight ten to one
