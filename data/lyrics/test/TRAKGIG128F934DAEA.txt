I aw your wild dancing shadow in the rain
A new world and my heart was drenched in champagne
The stars were shining
And the earth smelt sweet
Your footsteps in the sand
That sand touched my feet

You move me
Your the object of my desire
You move me
My spiritual satisfier
You move me
With a kisses burning like fire
You take me higher and higher and higher

You take me higher and higher and higher
...
