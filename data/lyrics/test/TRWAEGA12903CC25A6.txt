Winter in here ain't as cold as they say
We have nature, yes, we know the way
Accomodation in the lap of the nature
Can give you a moving response,
If you have the time...

Violate the law of the wild, see her lose her temper
Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

Build the campfire in a place you know safe
And then see that you put it out right
Can you see trail of garbage in there
...
