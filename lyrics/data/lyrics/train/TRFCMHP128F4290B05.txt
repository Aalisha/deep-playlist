(Chorus x4)
I gonna make
I'm gonna make my money (money)

From the time that I was only seventeen
I knew I loved to write, I knew I loved to sing, I've seen
I've seen about my friends and all the gangsta things we did, we did
Back in those days there was some who always said
You'll never make it no, you'll never get ahead of time
I guess I'm going for mine, contrary to what they said and I did
this is just to let you know

(Chorus x4)
I gonna make
I'm gonna make my money (money)
