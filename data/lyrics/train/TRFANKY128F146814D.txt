If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
No, if you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Hey, hey, hey, you better leave my woman alone

If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)
Hey, you better leave my woman alone

I know you got plenty money
