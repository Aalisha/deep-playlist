Well... it's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

A teenage boogie (hey hey)
A teenage boogie (ho ho)
A high schooly boogie (hey hey)
A hillbilly boogie (ho ho)
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)

Saturday night about eight o'clock
This old place begins to reel and rock
Everybody gathers from miles around
To hear them sing as they shuffle on down
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
