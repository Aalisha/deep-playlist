She said: "Don't take too big a breath."
She said: "Don't breathe in too deep, you might choke over the words you don't swallow."
She said: "Don't take too big a step."
She said: "Don't run too fast, you might trip over the path that you follow."

I get my way, I get my way.
Your complaints can't explain it.
I get my way... 

I don't need your direction. (I'm catchin' up to you.)
And I see my imperfections. (They're creeping up on me.)
And I don't need your direction. (I'm catchin' up to you.)
Don't turn down the bed, 'cause I'm not comin' home.
