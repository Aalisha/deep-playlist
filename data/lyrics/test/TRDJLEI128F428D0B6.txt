(Kix Brooks/Chris Waters)

I started my day with Corona
Hopin' it'd help me get over
The night that you left
But it didn't help
So I moved on to tequila
Built a pyramid up to the ceiling
Ten glasses high
But I can still hear you sayin' goodbye

It's gonna take more than a margarita
More than a shooter
To blow your memory away
I still need ya
I'm hurtin' without you
Even when I'm feelin' no pain
