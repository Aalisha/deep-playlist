Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine
Gonna have me a holiday
Poor man's party, rich man's daughter
Gettin' hotter and hotter

She's pushin' way too hard
I don't want any part of her way
Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine
Gonna have me a holiday

It's a holiday... It's a holiday

Mama mama please, no more jaguars
I don't want to be a pop star
Mama mama please, no more deckhands
...
