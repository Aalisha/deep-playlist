One to another
Do you remember me?
I feel so small
Well are you list'in to tonight
So temporary
The things that I have seen
I ran so far
Will you take me back again

Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me

Entertaining angels
By the time I fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me

One to another
The feelings in between
I won't let go
...
