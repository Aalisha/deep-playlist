And now you're searching for that new messiah,
it's your greatest passion,
to set 'em up and knock 'em down,
put him on a pedistal, idolitrary,
and it's regularly,
it all yours to their envy,
cause you hold a higher key of senses,
they are drawn like magnets,
to a genius it's confirmed

set him up and knock him down,
and your taste is so accountable,
but this is no great loss,
and sharing never was a choice,
...
