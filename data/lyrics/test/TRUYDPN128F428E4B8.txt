I know, you feel like a whore,
Working for a dream that isn't even yours.
Pleasing everybody but yourself
Would you rather be, somewhere else with someone else?

There's no reason to stay together,
Cause it's a pain and no pleasure, oh oh oh oh oh

It would feel so good to say goodbye,
When I'm with you I wanna die.
And all that time was such a waste,
I never wanna see your face,
I just want to get the fuck away.

We are falling apart,
Lost our soul and we lost our hearts.
We can't be shamed of being smart we are
...
