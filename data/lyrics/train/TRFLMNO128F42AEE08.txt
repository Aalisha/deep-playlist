(Chorus)
I make big money I drive big cars everybody know me
I make big money I drive big cars everybody know me
I make big money I drive big cars everybody know me
I make big money I drive big cars everybody know me cause ima superstar

Sean Paul
I slide everyday bitch im just waiting on my drop top
Purchased it wit cash money straight up off tha lot doc
This aint from no chop shop, damn near spent my whole wat
Call me for murda cause im fixin to make they heart stop
Nigga ima playa get a wit 'em at tha next bloack
Keep on working nigga keep on punchin in these clocks
Keep on steppin clost to me I swear you might get shot dawg
Its Sean Paul remember Shake Em Off
Was only 17 when they first broke me off
And eva since den ive been working stackin bread
