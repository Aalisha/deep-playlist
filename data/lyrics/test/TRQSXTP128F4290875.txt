Yo, I swear, I swear I miss the times when you would tie me to a chair 
and tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear, 
she would have me to herself she didnt want nobody else but I... 
See that was at the time (until). 
I see her kissing some other guy underneath the bridge, 
I never thought she would've done a thing like this, 
so i'm sorry make your way towards the door and never show your face again biatch. 

(Dappy) 

So who do you think I am. 
Who do you think you are. 
What the f**ks this, 
whats he doing here? 
These are my parts. 
Tell him to duck home. 
I swear Ill get him stripped down to his boxers 
chilling in C town, 
got no libary in oxford. 
Tell me what do you see in a dude like this. 
He can't even look me in the eyes, 
I can see straight through him he's just a bitch. 
Do you feel him cause hes rich, 
or do you leave me cos i'm broke, 
you was only with me yesterday your still bustin' my coat. 
You know im a sicko, 
sicko like my local pubs owner what was stanley suck and ball 
screwdriver straight camden hearted soldier i'm a thug 
yeah I thought that you loved me, 
I mean these days you see me and you don't even hug me. 

(Dappy) 

Now you and I, 
yeah we shared something special are you out of your mind? 

(Tulisa) 

Boy i'm really sorry give me one more try, 
cause everything you do got me going and I just can't lose this. 

(Dappy) 

Yeah I swear, I swear I miss the times when you would tie me to a chair, 
and tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear. 
She would have me to herself she didnt want nobody else but I... 
See that was at the time (until). 
I see her kissing some other guy underneath the bridge, 
I never thought she would've done a thing like this, 
so i'm sorry make your way towards the door and never show your face again biatch.
