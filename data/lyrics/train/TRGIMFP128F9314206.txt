In a desert
You’re standing
A silhouette
In motion

On the glory afternoons in June I need you
Just like raindrops (Just like raindrops)
You’ll feel so good upon my lips
Just like raindrops (Just like raindrops)
Even though you’re a million miles away

There’s a space out there
And then when we can move

On the glory afternoons in June I need you
Just like raindrops (Just like raindrops)
...
