Don't let your troubles make you cry
Don't waste a moment wonderin' why
When everything goes wrong
You have to go on and do it or die

Do it or die now stand your ground
Don't let your bad breaks go gettin' you down
Even when times get rough and you've had enough
You still gotta try

Do it no matter what the people say
