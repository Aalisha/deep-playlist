I'll pretend that I want you for what is on the inside
But when I get inside I'll just want to get out
I'm your first and last deposit through sickness and in hell
I never promised you a garden, you'll just water me down

I can't believe that you are for real
I don't care as long as you're mine

When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"
When I said "we" you know I meant "me"
And when I said "sweet" I meant "dirty"

I'm unsafe, I'm unsafe
I won't repent so
I memorize the words to the porno movies
It's the only thing I wanna believe
I memorize the words to the porno movies
