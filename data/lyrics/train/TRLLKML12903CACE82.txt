Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand

You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Whenever you're around

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
