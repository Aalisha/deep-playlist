Drank the dark wine of the New York night
My shattered mind across the borderline
Spent the night in someone else's arms

Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love

On a subway train before the dawn
The ride was short but my thoughts were long
Couldn't figure what got in to me

Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
