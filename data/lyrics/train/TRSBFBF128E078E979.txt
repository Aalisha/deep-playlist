You stand before me,
now we stare eye to eye.
Before another second click's away,
one of us will die.
You reach for your metal
as I reach for mine.
The sound of bullets flying through the air
is followed by a cry.

And they're cryin'

What will we do?
What will we say?
When it's the end of this game that we play
will we crumble into the dust my friend?
