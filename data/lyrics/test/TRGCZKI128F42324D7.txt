You cross the room to me
put a little bit of paper in my hand then leave
and as the door goes bang
there's a little bit inside me that hopes it is blank

but as the words you wrote are burning in my head they keep on turning
they say hold me tight,
cos im loosing all the energy to fight
yeh hold me tight,
...
