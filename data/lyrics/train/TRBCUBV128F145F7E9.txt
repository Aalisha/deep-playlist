Everyone laughed at her joke
As if they never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused
But every word that she spoke was a bore

And maybe it's because they had seen
The previews on the TV screen
Well this part is good and that's well understood
So you should laugh if you know what I mean

But it's all relative even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team
