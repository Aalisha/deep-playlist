Keith Sweat, Busta Rhymes
Ridin' with the Flipmode on fire now
I love to stand up in corners
With thugs, holdin' it down
Or be in golf courses

Sippin' on somethin' poly and contract
Love to floss heavy with shine for that ass
I love to hit and drop bombs right on top of that ass, wassup
I like to watch my whole crew break bread

We thug marraige, select chicks
Give me this head, stack for my crew
Not whips, it's just some of the wild shit
That I be lovin' to do, wassup

Girl it's gettin' 'round
Heard you wanna get down
Find out for yourself
How I really put it down

And maybe since you're curious
Take a ride and find out what
I do to make you fall deep in love
It's the things I do

The things I do, girl
Diamonds, I wear, dubs
Bentley, I drive
And the things I do
When we're makin' love

The things I do, girl
Diamonds, I wear, dubs
Bentley, I drive
And the things I do
When we're makin' love

One night is all I need to make you see
Two nights why don't you come home with me?
And I'll give you everything your body needs
Mya, Mya, Mya, Mya, I want you to see
