I was raised up on the Bible
With a picture of Jesus on the wall
I could hear my momma prayin?

My daddy was a deacon
Taught Sunday school for twenty years
And I remember all the stories
Of how the Lord would soon appear

He washed all my sins away
It makes me who I am, who I am today

I'm a believer, I? m never gonna be ashamed
I'm a believer, the good Lord He knows my name
