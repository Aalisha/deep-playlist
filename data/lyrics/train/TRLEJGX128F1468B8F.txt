Straight outta the metro rhythm central I'm innovative at thee
cause I go slow moe but never slow poke but never joke dope but never
coke spits a riddle like flim loose with my lyrics like double jointed
limbs I twist and I bend common episodes past freak mode the monstrous
bass beneath my pace be like morse code slash beep slash beep scanners
zero in to the system in your jeep I'm out there with Kool Keith and
Ced-Gee and De La inventors of my third seeing eye with futuristic
vision I'm not among loony nut cakes on a mission I gets in where I
fit in cause life's too short so you could all label me weirdo but yo
I know it's talent ...
