is it the life i wanted
when i was a little girl
to be here tonight
with you
dressed in white
i know, no
i'm a nurse in the disco
i'm a nurse in the disco
in white, i know
pretending to be a star
in the disco
in the disco
i'm a nurse in the disco
i'm a nurse in the disco
disco, disco, disco... disco
