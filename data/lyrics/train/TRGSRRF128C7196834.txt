You are the sunshine of my life, another Shakespeare of your time
You're like a ribbon in the sky, you are a poet's endless rhyme
You take me to a higher ground and then you knock me off my feet
Lately I been thinking 'bout ya, 'cause you been creeping in my dreams

You inspire me, the way you make me feel inside is amazing
Your honesty, your artistry is engaging
You are everything I hope to be

You have touched my soul, I want you to know
You are my hero
You got so much soul, to put it plain and simple
You are wonderful

I am your woman in red, I am girl blue, yeah
I am the black orchid, I am a golden lady too, yeah
You bring the music of your mind, to elevate human kind
That's why I'm sharing my emotions with inner visions I explode

You inspire me the way you make me feel inside is amazing
Your honesty, your artistry is engaging
You are everything I hope to be, yeah
