by Eric Clapton and Rick Danko

I don't want to be the one to say I'm sorry.
I don't want to be the one to take the blame.
I don't want to be the one to throw it over.
I don't want to be the one to feel ashamed.

I don't want to be the one who thinks of nothing.
I don't want to be the one to tell you what you have seen.
