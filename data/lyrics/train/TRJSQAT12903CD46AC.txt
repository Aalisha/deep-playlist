Now you've heard the
Story of the Hot Rod race
When the Fords and the

That story is true
I'm here to say cause
I was driving that Model A

She's got a Lincoln motor
And it's really souped up
That Model A body
Makes it look like a pup

It's got eight cylinders
And uses them all
With an overdrive
That just won't stall

Got a 4-barrel carb
And a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears
You can really get lost

It's got safety tubes
And I'm not scared
The brakes are good
And the tires are fair

We left San Pedro
Late one night
The moon and the stars
Was shining bright

Everything went fine
Up at Grapevine Hill
We was passing cars like
They was standing still

Then all of a sudden
Like the flick of an eye
A Cadillac sedan
Passed us by
