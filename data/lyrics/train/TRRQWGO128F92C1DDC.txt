I've been caged by you for such a long, long time
Had your own fun, take your way to fill my mind
We'll no one seen me guarding myself
So I kept me here, within my shell
And it took so long, for me to see
How demolishing you were to me

Look at me now
I'm stronger than before
'Cause I've found the strength within myself to close the door
And I close the door for you to ever come inside again
I've tried so hard to keep me sheltered from your kind of men

I've been blind and foolish but I was just a girl
