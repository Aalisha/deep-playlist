A darkened soul captive of the spell 
Bloody seizures festering in pain 
Bombing angels the reign of blood 'til death 
Camoflauged in the stench of human misery 
Chanting the prayer of no return 
Called by a whisper soon shrouded in blood 
Obdurate feelings a black heart will thrive 
Fumigated in a war for one's lust 
...
