Take these dogs away from me

Your life's a mystery
Mine is an open book
If I could read your mind
I think I'd take a look

I'm not scared, baby
I don't care

What have you got to hide?
What do you need to prove?
You're always telling lies
And that's the only truth

I don't care, baby
I'm not scared

Tonight, the streets are full of actors
I don't know why
Oh, take these dogs away from me
Before they, they bite
