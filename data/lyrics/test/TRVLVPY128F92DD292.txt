Here she comes
The girl with everything
Never needed nothing until you
Here I am
Committing every sin
Knowing that there's nothing I won't do

Cause I'm easy to love, easy to love
Just get to know me
Once I get going I just can't stop
Easy to love, easy love...

Sometimes I want to shed my skin
Show what's going on yeah
Deep inside
Right now I'm gonna let you in
