Trip doors kicked all around me, there
is no escaping
I slowly suffocate, I'm breathing
poisoned air

The Living dead are outside feasting
on your souls
infected followers now marching in
their path

Sudden explosion and the walls
collape before me
no longer prisoner, I have been
released

Headed towards chaos,
armaggedon closing in
...
