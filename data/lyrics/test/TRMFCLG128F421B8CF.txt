Called back in time by the ancient winds
Can't you recall all the memories?
Walking the lost way of those who lived
In loneliness

Think of the joy and the endless days
One step aside and the skies were grey
Is this a life or just a game to lose or win?

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
There will come then a time to understand...
Deep inside

Blessed by the rain falling from above
Could you imagine where life would take you
Now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad?

Still, don't you go, got to make a choice
