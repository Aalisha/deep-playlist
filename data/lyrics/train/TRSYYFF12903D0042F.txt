Deterioration accelerates
My kin a prisoner
Now the reaper awaits
A demon encased
Inside of human skin
A profiteer that feeds
A plague of addiction
There's no option, There's no recourse
There's no other way
Every meth lab burned
To ashes
Every meth lab burned

Crimson flames
Against the darkened sky
