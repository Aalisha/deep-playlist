It's hard to be
It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Can't you see
When I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy

Something inside of me... When she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel... Just gotta let her know

When I'm alone with her
And she's in my arms I'm in heaven

It's all I see
In my dreams, we'll be happy together
