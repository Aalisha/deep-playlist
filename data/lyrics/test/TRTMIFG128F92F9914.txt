Journey back to the darkside, back into the womb
Back to where the spirits move like vapor from the tomb
The centre of the cyclone blowing out the sun
Break the shackles of your union to the light

I might've had a brother, as I was born they dragged him under
To the other side of twilight, he's waiting for me now
Nativity was lost on me, I didn't ask, I couldn't see
What created me? What and where and how?

Welcome home – it's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home – we've opened up the gates
Welcome home – to your brothers and sisters
Welcome home – to an accident of birth
