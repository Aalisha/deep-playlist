Dear Lisa, I'm sorry you've lived with my folly
Suppose you're wondering where I am, so am I, wondering where I am

I saw that church grand isn't it, someone believes in it, someone was buried there
Someone was carried there hoping to healed, that's why I left, it's exactly how I feel

I remain sincerely yours
...
