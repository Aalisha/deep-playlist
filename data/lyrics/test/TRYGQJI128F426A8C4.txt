led to the slaughter by those who were there to protect
nailed to the cross then put on display to dissect
dignity stripped like flesh being ripped from the bone
sentence: death by mongrels to which you are thrown

here comes the pack
come to attack
blood in their eyes
no compromise
thrown to the wolves
left there to die

hiding from shadows that chase by the light of the moon
...
