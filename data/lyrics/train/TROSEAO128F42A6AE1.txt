Ooh, I wanna be girl, let me be

I wanna be everythin' your man's not
And I'm gonna give you
Every little thing I got
'Cause you are more than a man needs
That's why I say you're truly my destiny

I'm gonna get cha
If it takes until forever
No you don't feel me
If forever turns into never
I'll let you know my love
Is just as strong
And for you never just ain't that long

I wanna be the smile
You put on your face
I wanna be your hands
When you say your grace
I wanna be whatever
Is your favorite place, oh
I just wanna be close

I wanna be the hat you put on your head
I wanna be the sheets
You put on your bed
I wanna be the skirt
Wrapped around your legs
Oh, I just wanna be close

And even if the day turns into night
I will love you by candlelight
And even if the water starts to run over
...
