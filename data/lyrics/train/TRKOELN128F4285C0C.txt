High up in the sky the sun glows
It's early on the beach and who knows
The scenery could get very hot today

I come here 'cause I like the water sports
I come here 'cause I'm getting good reports
But most of all it's wave babies, I gotta see

Wave babies, when they're lying on the sand
Wave babies and I want them in my hand
In my hand
