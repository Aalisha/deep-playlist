Pink neon lights
Glow in the skyline
It's our night
Let's play 'til daylight
Do this right
'Cause it's the last time

From dusk 'til dawn
Now we are ready
Take this on
The beat's so heavy
Do this right
'Cause it's the last time

Don't think about a single thing
We know what this night's gonna bring

We're spinning round (before the night fades)
Spinning round (before the day breaks)
