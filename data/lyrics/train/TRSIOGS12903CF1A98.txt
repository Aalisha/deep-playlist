Princess of Hell - Give it to me
Princess of Hell - It's my decay
Princess of Hell - For your body to smell

These lyrics are simple to understand
There's nothing more for me to say
Into the pleasure of pure feeling
We all think the same you look like me

I was the first - I am not the last
So face the dead - let's start it fast
Survive the mighty flash of thrash

Amps are roaring - power chords clash
Our razor blade edge - hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds - for the metal blizzard
Wring your axe - to bomb the hall
Blood on my strings - until I fall
