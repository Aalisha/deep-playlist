(K-Rino:)
I don't know where I'm at, or who I am
I'm being asked if I recognize certain places and faces, scriptures and diagrams
Evaluations, to see where my mind is
They said I'd understand in due time, but I don't know what time is
They bring a woman in, to visit me
And she descriptively begins to give to me, vivid periods of my history
I'm trying to figure out, who this could be
A mystery at all persistively, right now I don't even exist to me
She kisses me, like she been missing me
Then instantly the doctor gives her paper, with twenty words on a list to me
For hours, he tried to empower me
And out of the twenty nineteen I couldn't place, but one was jumping out at me
I don't feel crazy, I'm very sane
I'm trying to gain recollection, the doctor matches pictures up to every name
I try to concentrate to remember, but nothing comes
I overheard the doctor, tell the same lady I'm suffering from amnesia

(Hook: x2)
My world, ain't the same
Don't know who I am, I don't know my name
Can't remember my life, I can't remember my ways
Can't remember my nights, can't remember my days

(K-Rino:)
