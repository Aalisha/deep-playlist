By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is save your tears for I'm not worth it
You see?
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam -
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home.

I'm telling you that's my home.

You had a romance did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see?
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam.
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
That's my home.

Oh
...
