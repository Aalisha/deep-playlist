so where are we now
a summer's end autumn breeze
the winter is at your sleeve
the leaves have all gone
the windows are filled with frost
if i don't come home i'm lost
mary mark and john
put on their shoes
and all ran home
and we're all here all alone
now they've gone
there's ice on the pond
the fishes have gone to sleep
the water is cold and deep
...
