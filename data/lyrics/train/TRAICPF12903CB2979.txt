I am the hollow face who controls vile delusion
and bends the souls of men
A kind and gentle voice to lure the Great Unwashed
All hail the age of sin

My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts

I am a fiction but in your heads
I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake
Ignorance shall prevail
