Well I brake for brunettes
Blondes in Corvettes
Redheads that stop on a dime
Now the way I drive
It's a wonder that I ever get anywhere on time
So don't tailgate my pickup truck
Or you might just wind up in a wreck
Now they ain't made the sticker for my bumper just yet
But I brake for brunettes

I let Firestone put me some new tires on
Just a few weeks ago
But man I swear
That wear and tear is already starting to show
Well I oughta just whistle and yell
