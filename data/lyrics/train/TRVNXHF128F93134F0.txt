Planet asia

I heard you went platinum on your first album
But tell me this: why is it now i heard you only sold about 200'000?
Now what's that tellin you?
That your fans was never down
Got you wonderin now
'maybe i shoulda stayed underground?'
But you can't come back, cause real rap fans, they hate you
You over-did your image, now you can't stay true
All glittery and shiny lookin empty on the camera
With nothin to say, dancin with the mic like who.?
Y'all cats done fell off, and we in this for the long term
20 years from now the cali agents still burn
Next to whoever doubt dare the rep through
Planet asia, rasco, cali agents ghetto respect due

Chorus

Never forget where you came from
Never forget where you got your name from
And the game from
The laws of nature won't bless you
You'll be forever unprotected
Rasco, planet asia, yeah, ghetto respected (2x)
