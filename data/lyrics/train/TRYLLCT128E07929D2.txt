I once had a friend
They found him in a car
A hose to the window
And the motor running hot
Seems he couldn't take it
The rhetoric of life
Someone found him naked
With a note right by his side
by his side
Oh by his side

He can't take it back
Neither can I
No, neither can I

Mommy and daddy
I've borrowed the car
to sleep on the floor
I'm sorry so much
For bringing my own living hell to
your door
Thanks for all the flowers
At the ringside seat
...
