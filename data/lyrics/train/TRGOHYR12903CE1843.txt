Can't beat the best ones
A little closer maybe a bit too close
You function you turn out
A flawless performance

Turn your camera away from me
Spill your guts in 8mm
Put your focus where your mouth is
You're the only one who's fading here

Such holidays in the sun don't come without sacrifices
You know it makes more sense
