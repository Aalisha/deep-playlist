Rosie never was one for turning heads
She was just always kinda there
She had a few nice features more or less
No red ribbons in her hair

Since that Jessie's been coming to the diner
Folks are saying that she's never looked finer
She's got a different air

She's taken a shine to him
Becoming the woman that she's never been
And all of guys are wishin' they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now's there a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem - a diamond within
...
