What if I was in your dream?*
Maybe you'd believe.
Maybe it would be real to me.
Crawl
All these miniaturized fantasies when you deserve it all,
And I'd wait but youï¿½d make me wait just grab your hand and say
I don't mind if I have to sit and wait.
Cut diamonds on my teeth,
Skin off my taint.
Feels good so much the soul flows like I said we flow,
I don't mind,
...
