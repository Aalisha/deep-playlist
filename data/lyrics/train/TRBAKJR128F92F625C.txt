I've kind of got used to being cold
I know I was warm one day a long, long time ago
Maybe there's a road that's not this hard

I'd rather not way why I couldn't stay home
But now I get paid never to be alone
Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
Maybe there's a road that's not this hard

The trucks roll by here every night
I know how to come on in a headlight
Maybe there's a road that's not this hard
...
