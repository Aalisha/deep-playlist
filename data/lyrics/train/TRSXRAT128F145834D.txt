Put it down to the fighting
Put it down to the fools who play in the game
I'm picking up second sight
I'm picking up tired ways
But you better believe it
Oh you better believe before it's too late
I'm feeling like letting go
Of living in a dangerous time

It must've been lonely, it must've been cold
...
