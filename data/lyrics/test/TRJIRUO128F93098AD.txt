There's something cold beyond my actions
In front of you I feel lost
And bloodless
Like a piece of glass
Like an independent second
The time has lost each meaning
And I wait outside my dress
Just like
A cold alien injection
I'm feeling inside
My own distortion
Spinning around
My mind's connection
I feel Voices inside
Like an infection
There's something cold beyond my actions
In front of you I feel lost
And bloodless
Like a piece of glass
Tryin' to make a transformation
There is not cure
For what I've been
...
