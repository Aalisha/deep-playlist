Come fly with me tonight
Come carry me away from all these troubles in my life
I've had to face
This time i'll make it right
I've learned from my mistakes and i will never say goodbye to you

[CHORUS:]
So i'll be your promise keeper
Your one believer
As long as i'm alive
And i'll be your one and only
And hold you closely
Until the day i die
