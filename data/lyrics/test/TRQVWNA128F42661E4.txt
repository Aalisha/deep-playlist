Why do you touch me, then turn away
Is there something you're afraid to feel
Boy, if you want me, it's getting late
Come and show me if your love is real

'Cause I heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another friend
About the good things you do for me
I don't believe it 'cause I've never seen it
Now's the right time, prove it to me

I don't know what you've been told
But love has gotta come from the heart
You better shape up

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby

You've got emotions like everyone else
But you've gotta learn to let 'em show
I can't be in love all by myself
It takes two to make love grow

Make your move, I'm waiting for you
Actions speak louder than words

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
