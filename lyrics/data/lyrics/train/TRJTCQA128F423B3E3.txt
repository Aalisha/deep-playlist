Oh child, precious one
Let your life shine like the sun
But you say, "How long till I can come home,
till I can rest in Your arms again?"
And I say, "Not long, but don't miss this life,
and I'll be waiting till then...

Live with the wonder of a child
Pray with your arms thrown open wide
Love with a love that has no end
...
