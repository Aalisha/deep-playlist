There's a sound from the kitchen,
and it's the sound he has heard a thousand times before.
When he hears his mother crying, he runs away and hides inside his room.

But there is no escaping the echo in his fathers voice.
And when the tears are falling,
he falls into his knees and prays;

Just hold me, and love me.
Trash this child of love,
and try your best and save this broken home.
