Heart and soul I come to you
Are we meeting here on cue
Just in time for a love affair?
Like a fool that walked through fire
Just to reach my heart's desire
Baby would you be waiting there?

If this could be the one?
Woh-oh -- lookin' for a love that's everlasting
Wonder if the feeling's strong enough
Tell me are we merely lovers passing
Or an everlasting love?
