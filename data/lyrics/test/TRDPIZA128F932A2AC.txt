Baby, baby, baby
You don't know how many times
I have seen you passin' by
And heard a sweet song

I keep sayin' someday
If I somehow catch your eye
I would tell you everything
That I've been thinkin' of you for so long
For so long

And when the loneliness comes back
You're pushin' it away

Baby, baby, baby
There's this emptiness inside
And it makes me want to hide
Before I start
