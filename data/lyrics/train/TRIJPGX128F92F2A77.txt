I been working all day for me mate on the site
Running around like a blue arsed fly
I been working
And I been working all day for me mate

Every bleeding minute I been on the go
Up and down the ladder like a fiddler's elbow
I been working
I been working all day for me mate

[Chorus]
Wait for tomorrow at half past ten
When I sign on, but until then
I'll be working
I'll be working all day for me mate

Aint' got no cards, don't pay no tax
