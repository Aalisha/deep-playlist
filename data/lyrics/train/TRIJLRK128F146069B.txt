Yeah, yeah (Young Roscoe)

Bridge:

Young Roscoe, that's my name
I ain't no talker, I gotta.
Roscoe bustin on lames to get the scrilla nigga
Roscoe, see me in traffic of this static with my.
Roscoe who dat little nigga weakin at me like?
Young Roscoe

I brought my Head up high, shorty make it pop
Get your legs up high, rest,?
Let me get your number, let me get your bing
Every brizzle on the scene screamin in my limousine
Ooh, Ahh! Scoe Dizzle too fly
Fools want a Bruce die, I'm the one that cruise by
Young with da ill flow and everybody know that
Young Roscoe Tabasco Desoto (c'mon)
I luv it when they jiggle it like J-Lo
Scodie get them bizzle wiggle it like "Hello!"
Why do we die? Hands up to the sky
Roll it up, now we smoke, smoke, smoke it
Show me love when you see me, pass by don't trip
Show me love if I ask you to strip, don't trip
20 inches on my ride, my head? it to the side
Chicken heads wonder who am I (yeah)
C'mon

Hook: 2x
