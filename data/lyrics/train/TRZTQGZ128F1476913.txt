Got no place to go,
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico,
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin,
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in.

We got airplane rides,
We got California drowning out the window side,
We've got big black cars,
And we got stories,
How we slept with all the movie stars.

I may take a holiday in Spain,
Leave my wings behind me,
Drink my worries down the drain,
And fly away to somewhere new.

Hop on my choo-choo,
...
