I feel fine
Don't wake me up yet
O the young and the old they get everything
and it's my turn

I'm here
I'm someone to know
I'm calling the tune but
I'm losing the words

Laughingly I take the fevered applause
of the people by the riverside
I'm walking
Walking on water
God knows why

I'm losing the words
...
