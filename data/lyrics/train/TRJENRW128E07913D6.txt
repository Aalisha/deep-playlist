Standing on a land unknown, interpreting the same
Believing in a chance of hope and see it slowly fade
It's breaking far away, replacing what I'm made of

Looking for a way to show
(That I'm)
Searching for a faith who knows
(That I'm)
Screaming for a place to go

'Cause I'm drowning in the violent seas
Of being force fed society's
Shallow end of misery, please take me away 'cause I can't stay
Looking for a way to show that I'm okay
