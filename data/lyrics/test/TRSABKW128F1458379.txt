Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day she sends
Everything is free

I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make this mess
When I was Mary's prayer?

Suddenly the Heavens roared
Suddenly the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew

So when you find somebody you keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say, save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Mary's
Leave a light on in Heaven for me
