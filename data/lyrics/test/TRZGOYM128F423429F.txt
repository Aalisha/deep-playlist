If you stay, stay darling
(Stay in my corner)
You make me so proud, stay darling
Please, stay
(Stay in my corner)

To the world I'd cry my love
How I love you
Honey, I love you, I really love you
(Stay, stay, stay, stay)
Please, please, please stay darling
(Stay in my corner)

And I will never, never let you down
Just say you'll stay
(Stay in my corner)
'Cause I'll need you always around
...
