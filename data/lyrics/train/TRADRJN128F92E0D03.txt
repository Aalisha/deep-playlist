I was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
I was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
The way you treat me, baby
Gonna drive old me insane

You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
