Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl

Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Save her love and
Kisses just for you

Well, the very first
Time I fell in love
Got my heart broken there

People would say
When I passed their way
There's a hurt young man
Going there, going there
An unhappy lad going there

Well, one day my mother
Called me to her side
Son, why are you so blue
Mother, I've lost
The girl that I love
