If I could I would be smoke
And I'd float myself out of here
And I'd go wherever you are
And I'd never have to be too far from here
And I'd linger in your fingers
A transparent shade of gray
And watch as you watch me
Slowly fade away
Into the night
Where are you when I need you by my side

Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Get lost in a moment
Wasting time trading smiles
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Come on won't you waste my time
...
