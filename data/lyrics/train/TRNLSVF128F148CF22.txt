Blue eyes, brown hair
Yeah, that's my past standing there
Turning every head in here tonight
That smile, that laugh, everyone is staring at
That's the one thing that stands between

And I'm looking at one right now
Heartaches written all over this one
One I can't get around
Where's a door when you need one
I know a wall when I see one
