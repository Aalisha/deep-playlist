Come on and break down and show us who you are
Memorable first impressions only get you far
When you stay true, from beginning to end
Flexing all your morals, your environment will bend back
As you bend crooked

Come on and break down, fake persona's from your art
I used to hang on every verse when my days would get hard
Flash forward, to present day and time,
A fraud, a hoax, a method actor reading scripted lines back 
Why'd you take that path?
There's no way back

We are the spark
That once would ignite a pilot light, burning deep in your heart
The start of making yourself out to be bigger than you really are

Conscience is calling,
C-Come and shut it up.
Yeah, I know life gets rough sometimes
Big dollars take the pressure off of hard times
But gluttony's a sin, and hunger will not let you win 
If you don't get a grip, use some self will to control it
...
