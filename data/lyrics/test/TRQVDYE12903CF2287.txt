So loaded with anger, so filled with rage
Time for revolution
You are out for blood.
Crush the power
You will never feel free in this slavery system.

We are digging our own graves
In the gutter we will stay
Until we heed out in war,
Against the global powers we will reign.

Cut of the power by their knees
Grab your knives and bring the ropes
Tie them up, shoot their veins full with the shit they are selling
Tear apart their smiling faces and burn them alive.
