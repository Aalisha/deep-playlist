Can't tell my future,
And i can't tell my past.
Can't tell my future,
And i can't tell my past.
Lord, it seems like every minute,
Sure gonna be my last.

The minutes seems like hours,
And hours seems like days.
The minutes seems like hours,
And hours seems like days.
And it seems like my woman,
Outta stop her lowdown ways.
