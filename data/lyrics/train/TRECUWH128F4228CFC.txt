You gotta do right by me
It's mandatory, baby
Sweeter than your favorite ice cream be
Bask in my glory, baby

Don't play no games, that'll ruin things
And make me leave you or mistreat you
And you don't want that
Don't hesitate, I can make you great
Like Cleopatra Jones I could set you straight

I'm the real thing in stereo
I got a little highs, I got a little lows
Follow this melodic flow
I can make it shine, I can make it glow

I'm the real thing in stereo
I got a little highs, I got a little lows
Follow this melodic flow
I can make it shine, I can make it glow

I'm more than a toy for your satisfaction
