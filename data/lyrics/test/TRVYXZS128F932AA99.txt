You say you're hard
you're soft as lard
Think you're a man?
Soft as flan!
You think you're tough?
You're mallow fluff
You talk about
so whip the the ruler out

So...

Can you measure up?
Can you measure up?
Can you measure up?
GET THE RULER OUT!

Can you measure up?
Can you measure up?
Can you measure up?
GET THE RULER OUT!
