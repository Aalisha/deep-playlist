All we need is some time for love
All we need is some time

People have explored now
Dark side of the silver moon
Ice is found in Africa

Rich men, you have bored
Just to send the satellite
Are you satisfied

Me, I've got a car
It's only worth a have to me
But I'm full of fantasy

Will you come along
Take my hand and you will see
All alone, you and me, we are free

REFRAIN:
Time for love
We're dreaming the night away
Time for love
Let's do it again
Time for love
We're kissing our tears away
More and more, it's time

Time for love
We're dreaming the night away
Time for love
Let's do it again
Time for love
...
