Chorus:
She's a tamale drunk on corvsier
She wanna party after the party
She wanna private dance with somebody
Cause her body gotta a mind of its own 'own.oh oh oh own.
Nah nah nah nah na na na na na'.

Just the way how she move her body
You can tell that shes a tamale
Hips moving like a ferrari
You can tell that shes a tamale
(Repeat)

Verse 1:
As soon as she walked thru the door aha aha
And back her thing up on the floor aha aha
Its getting hot it's a bout to blow
Tell the firetruck to bring the hose
Showing off her belly skin
Looking sexy with naval ring
