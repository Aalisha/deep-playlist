On and on
Write a song that saves the world and don't be wrong
Sing it up to god until she sings along
Tell me how to walk the line
Tell me how to lead the blind
with my shoes untied

On and on we whisper
Tell me how to scream
I've been screaming like a dreamer
Who cannot fall back to sleep
Tell me bout the road you're on
and maybe we could meet
Tell me bout the road your
On and on and on we whisper

And all this time
...
