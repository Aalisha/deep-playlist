S Club
Get down tonight, uh come on, yeah
uh, get down tonight, uh huh
everybody get down tonight, come on

S Club (there ain't no party like an S Club Party, oh)
Gonna show you how (everybody get down tonight)
S Club (there ain't no party like an S Club Party, oh)
Gonna take you high (shake your body from side to side)

Finally Friday night
Feeling kinda good, looking alright
Gotta get moving, can't be late
Gotta get grooving, just can't wait (hey)
Get the feeling (get the feeling)
Push the ceiling (push the ceiling)
Player hater (player hater)
Get ready everybody cuz here we go

S Club (there ain't no party like an S Club Party, oh)
Gonna show you how (everybody get down tonight)
S Club (there ain't no party like an S Club Party, oh)
Gonna take you high (shake your body from side to side)
