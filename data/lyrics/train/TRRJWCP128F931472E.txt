it's a casual goodbye, goodbye
off the mountainside
seen but not for long, too long
as our lights look down the road

casual we ride, we ride
to the mid day light
casual we drive, we drive
off the mountainside
and the ground, it's closing down
out run it
it's a casual goodbye off the mountainside
seen but not for too long, too long
as our lights look down the road
casual we ride through the big blue sky
...
