Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find out what you've got is gone
Make sure you know what you know when you know it
Or before you know it you'll be all alone

Take care when you do what you do if you do it
If you don't you won't have your baby long
Be glad you've got what you've got when you've got it
Or you're gonna find that what you've got is gone
