I love you more than life
I'd give you all I have you know
I need you next to me

Like the touch of a star
You came to my life
Giving me happiness
With the warmth of the sun
You blessed me inside
Giving me radiance
Oh you know it's true (you know it's true)
My miracle is you

I love you more than life
I'd give you all I have you know
I need you next to me
You always give me love
You're sent from up above you know
I need you next to me
