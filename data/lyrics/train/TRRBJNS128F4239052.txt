[INTRO:]
Beware for the Shottas dem strap
rastaman ah tell di youths dem fill low di Glock
Beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care(no ooo)

Its a shame to see brothers killing themselves
Wasting energy, should be uplifting themselves
Who's di enemy putting shots on the shelf
What we need is brain-food and belly-food for our health

So don't get caught up in a petty passion
Be careful of dem guns and ammunition
And let us make a change in meditation
Cause we could use the strength for cultivation(my lord!)

[Chorus:]
Beware for the Shotta dem strap
Rastaman ah tell di youths dem nuh rat-ta-ta-tat
Beware now dat cause heart attach and dem nuh care and dem wi shot yuh inna yuh poop-poop-poop
