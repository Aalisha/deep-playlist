It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better, better

You're feeling all alone
Your pain is very real
It seems to be no way out
Just look above and deep inside
You can survive

It's gonna get better
Don't give up now please
It's gonna get better
Just stick around

Weeping may endure for a night
But joy will come
There's hope so will you stay
It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better
