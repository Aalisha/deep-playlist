Relief just for the night,
We are resist our will to fight.
Break forth and cry aloud
By flocks and hoards we need you now.

Strike them with terror,
Let the nations know their only men.
We'll reap what we sow,
So let the harvest begin.

For all that we've lost
We'll regain we'll relay the message,
With fear and oppression.

Why do you hide yourself
The wicked hunts down the weak,
Who are caught in the traps of devices.
