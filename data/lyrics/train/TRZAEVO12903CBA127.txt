I'm gonna curse this city if it robs me
Im gonna curse this city if it robs me one more time
before it even knew me it forgot me
I'm gonna curse this city if it robs me one more time

yeah All around the world today
Power is the measure oh no
Power is the only drug they don't want you to remember oh no
All around the world power gets no pressure oh no
Power is the only drug you never got no lectures on

And hope showed up one day
Then all the people say
The time, the time has come
Alright let's give it a name and oh
Listen all my friends
Who's gospel is who's pain
From the Hudson to the Rhine
Every place every time

I'm gonna curse this city if it robs me
Im gonna curse this city if it robs me one more time
before it even knew me it forgot me
I'm gonna curse this city if it robs me one more time

Yeah all around the world today
Power is the measure oh no
Power is the only drug they don't want you to remember oh no
If you really want to rise get your work done on someone else's time
