Overbearing woman makin' it so hard for me
Now you've laid it down for all to see, yeah
Can I ask a question, do you think that you can take a blow?
This is why I always come and go, yeah

Careful of words that get caught in your throat
Face the music, take it like a man
Givin' it to me anyway that you can, yeah

Everybody's feeling
Everything you've got to feel
