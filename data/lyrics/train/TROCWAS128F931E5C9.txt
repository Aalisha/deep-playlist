Missin'
Yearnin'
Tossin'
Turnin'
Fiendin'
For her STILL
Waitin'
Shakin'
Hatin'
Havin'
Flashbacks
Askin'
Why me
Blindly
Walkin'
Hopin'
Prayin'
That she
Finds me
Sees me
Needs me
Wants me
STILL

By her side
STILL

I've been fine
But tonight was tough(oh)
Heard our song (yeah)
My heart had enough
Finish my drink
Hug my friends
They all look concerned
I smiled at them
I say that I'm fine
But that is a lie
Wanna hide behind
She is on my mind
Outside is cold
And damn these cabs
I need one really bad
But they all pass
Memories
They just creep back in (yeah)
I zone out on (yeah)
Remember whens'
Cab cuts through and I hop on in
Just drive man, drive
Is all I say to him
