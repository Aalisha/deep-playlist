Whose prison break is the most impressive?
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go Tim Robbins in Jacob's Ladder.
Such patience, such verve and poise,
But wait a minute, shit, that's the wrong film.
Morgan Freeman would roll in his grave, if he were dead,
Which he nearly was, if you believe the hysterical gung-ho Technicolor crapfest
That is Sky News, or Murdoch live, or whatever the hell the devil calls himself.
Sky News, or Murdoch live, or whatever the hell the devil calls himself.
I preferred him when he was red and blatant, that guy.
I liked him better when he swooped around the land indiscriminately,
Bending wills and souls with glee,
Hurrying kids to their graves at sea.
Magnetically debasing the casts of the earth
In a terrible, wonderful focus of horrors,
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet,
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet,
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet,
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet.

I'm on a mercy mission to prove to my new love
