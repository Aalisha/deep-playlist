First time I saw her
I wanted to do more than just hold her
I wanted to bend her and fold her
So I lent over and I told her
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Phones ringing all weekend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend

We want to be lapsed catholics
We've got the contraception
But we haven't got the knack yet
