I am a TV savage (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
I am a TV savage (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
I am a TV savage (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
(She is a TV artist)
Like Ronnie Reagan, Sue Ellan, Casanova
Boticelli in a time, never, never Queen Diana, Rockerfeller
(She is a TV artist) and she don't wanna go to the TV
I am a TV artist (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
I am a TV savage (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
I am a true magician (and you don't wanna go to the TV)
Beams, see the beams, see the beams, see the beams in the TV
Beams, see the beams, see the beams, see the beams in the TV
I am an athlete picture (never lie, never lie, never never lie)
