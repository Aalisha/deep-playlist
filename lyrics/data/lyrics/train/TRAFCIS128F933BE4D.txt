When I try to describe how I feel when you hold me
I get butterflies lullabies, it's hard to explain
Like the sent of a rose or the sound of the rain
It's too precious and too wonderful to give it a name
Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words
I cannot take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart?
It's on the tip of my tongue
