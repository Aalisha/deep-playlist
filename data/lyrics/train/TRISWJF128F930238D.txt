Spent the last year staring at the sea
Message in a bottle, kept coming back to me
Picked it up and threw it hard
Landed in my neighbors yard
Life is but a dream
I'm just waiting here in nowhere land
Waiting for someone to be
Counting pictures on my wall
Waiting for my curtain call
Somewhere is waiting for me
Oh my darling, catch me if I fall
Here in nowhere land
...
