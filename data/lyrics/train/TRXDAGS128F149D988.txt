It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it long before we ever knew
Now I just can't believe you're in my life
Heaven's smiling down on me as I look at you tonight

I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doing when he joined these two hearts
I hold everything when I hold you in my arms
I've got all I'll ever need
