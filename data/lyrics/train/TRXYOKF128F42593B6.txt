Ooh, ooh it's party time
It's time to get you off my mind
Forget the life I left behind
And all those dreams that won't come true

Ooh, ooh its party time
It's time for laugh and pass the wine
It's early and I'm feelin' fine, I'll soon be over you

Darlin' ever since the day
Yes it's time to go our separate ways
I've been searchin' for a way to be
For doing you so wrong
