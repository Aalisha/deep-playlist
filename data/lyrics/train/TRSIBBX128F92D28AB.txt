Have you ever heard a thunder bolt voice your name?
Lets all just reach our hands into the dark,
And feel what reaches back!
I stopped subscribing to you a long time ago,
But I still see you, every fucking month!

Don't get the octopus upset,
It may eat itself!
If only we could grow back our privileges.
Tunnel vision. (If only I could touch your face again! )
I am not sleeping;
I'm only resting my eyes,
I'm only resting my eyes!

I didn't think that air could scream in resistance,
Until you, approached me protesting your advancement,
Don't walk any closer, don't you dare, walk any closer!
I forgot who you were...
