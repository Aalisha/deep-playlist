Born into sin with an apple in my hand
A devil of a kid, I made an early stand
Educated, medicated ain't part of my scene
I'm gettin' out tonight, I'm feelin' real mean

I've got a lover downtown
She never give me the shove
Only her love
From heaven above
I've been in and out, good to bad
Best to the worst
Sure I've been cursed
But it's a life
Woo! Mmm yeah

Hot tricks uptown, east side my crowd
Screamin' in the night with the fireflies
Oh, don't you know Gypsy Joe's got a heart of gold
With a jingle in the pocket and stars in his eyes,
yeah!

Well I'm a first class hot top
Struttin' my stuff
Turnin' 'em on
Turnin' 'em down
I could have been a millionaire
Or a senator's son
But I'm a bum
I'm havin' some fun
...
