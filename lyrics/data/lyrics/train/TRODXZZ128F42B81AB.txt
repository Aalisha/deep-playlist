She was 14 and he was 24
Shorty claimed she never had sex before
He's driving Benz and got a lot of dough
He takes her to the movies and buys her Nike's yo
And makes sure she think that she got it all
Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

It makes me wanna cry
Cause the shorty's being treated just like a woman
It makes me wanna cry
Cause her parents ain't even trying to confront him
It makes me wanna cry
Black people we need to show our children a little loving
It makes me wanna cry
Get back in the church read your Bibles get out the struggle
It makes me wanna cry (ooh ooh)
