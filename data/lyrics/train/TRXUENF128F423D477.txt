I'm being dragged down, down by the hand
The hand of a golden giant man
He's crushing my knuckles and splitting my skin
He says,? He'll let go if only I'd ask it of him?

He says,? Girl, it's your call, you wanna fly
You wanna fall", so I shout
"I wanna get away from you as fast as I can"
I tell my feet to move it, I hope they have a plan

These little black sandals are walking me away
These little black sandals are heading the right way
These little black sandals are walking me away
These little black sandals saved my life today
