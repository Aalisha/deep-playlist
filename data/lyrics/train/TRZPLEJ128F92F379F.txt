Chorus:
Girl I apologize for everything ive said and done
I know them lonely nights up in the crib they wasnt fun
If only I could just turn back the hands of time
I would do it just to make you mine (just for you)
I would treat every precious kiss like it was the last (for you)
Hold your body so tender like it was made of glass (for you)
Drop a million dollars down into a wishing well
Only for you baby only for you
Verse 1:
Im not a perfect man ive said that many times
You take away your love you take away the rhyme
Then im just left with nothing at all
I might have money ball but if you aint here to call my baby
Then im just left with nothing oh girl ive made mistakes
But see I learned my lesson sometimes thats what it takes
For people to see that something is good
I didnt do all i could but not thats so understood
Chorus:
Girl I apologize for everything ive said and done
