(Hunter)Well the times are gettin' hard
For you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin'All over God's world
You can't remember when
You got your last meal
And you don't know
Just how a woman feels
You didn't know what
Rock-n-roll was
Until you met my drummer
On a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands
Across your state line
Now it's the middle of the night
On the open road
And the heater don't work
And it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired
...
