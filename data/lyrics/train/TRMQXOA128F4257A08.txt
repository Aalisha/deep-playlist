Love you like mad!

When am with you girl
Im down with anything
I like the things that we do 
If you know what I mean

They way you turn me on
To the early morn

When we're all alone
We can make it right
Its like that everyday and every night
You touched my heart my body and soul

Ill be, everything that you want me to be
Ill do, everything that you want me to do
Ill say everything that you want me to say

I wana love you like this
I wana love you like that
I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad

I wana love you like this
I wana love you like that
I wana be your everything tonight 
I wana love you like mad
