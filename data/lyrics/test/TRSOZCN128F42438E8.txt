No I didn't write the book on love
But I try my best to read it everyday
To learn the way to a good girls heart
By being a gentleman

So, I am lookin' high and low
To find a way to make you love me
So won't you please tell me
What can I say to make you love me girl?

Playin' games of hide and seek
The answer keeps evading me
I don't know where to look and to find
The answer, oh wee baby

I am lookin' high and low
To find a way to make you love me
So won't you please tell me
...
