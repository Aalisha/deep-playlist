Jungle brothers on the run y'all, jungle brothers on the run, (x2)
Jbeez on the run, jbeez on the run.(x2)

Come on
Oh, I run so much, you would think I'm a bandit. (why? )
You know why because I keep standing at it.
Move so much, I often lose my shadow.
Don't know where, but I know I got to go.
Meet somebody at a quarter to eight.
I'm a scooby do so I don't be late.
If I take my vine,
I'll make it on time,
And if not, they'll be on my behind.
I get there late, but better later than never.
And when I get there, whatever is clever.
I won't be stopped by a chick or a cop
You know what I'm saying?
I know what you're saying.

{chorus}
(i can't stop)
Cause i'm
(on the run)

(i can't stop)
Cause i'm, cause i'm, cause i'm, cause i'm
(on the run)
{end of chorus}
