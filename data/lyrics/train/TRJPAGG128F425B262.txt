Not even once did I turn did I turn it hit me (damn)
Not even once did I turn it hit me (damn)
It seems I keep waiting for something to happen
But nothing ever happens so I wait, nothing
So every time I get up I push up I move up
I'll get slammed down sewn down slammed down
And I don't want to be held by your stitches
And now I'm ripping up tearing out left the only standing witness
Damn what's up yeah what's up
