No more lonely nights I'm with you
And I'm holding you tight
The wasted nights you sat and dreamed of her
'Coz she ain't coming back
When your days and nights get colder
You can think of me, you can imagine what's right
'Coz I'll be the only one
'Coz baby this love could be right

It might as well be me
To take all the hurt and pain inside
It might as well be me
Let the sound of my voice soothe you inside
Oh it might as well, might as well be me
Me
