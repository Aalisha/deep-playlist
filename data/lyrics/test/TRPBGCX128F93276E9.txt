Juicy, Juicy gotta good idea now, she been thinkin' all night,
Tryin' to talk me into makin' a deal now, she don't like tears in a fight,
Juicy, Juicy gotta work in out yeah, she wears a killer girdle,
Some other things are comin' out of her mouth oooh, she gotta lotta hurt.
I told her I don't wanna kiss no heiney, which didn't work,
But you can only get that shit so shiny, when you polish a turd.
