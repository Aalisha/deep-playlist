A note by the door, simply explains, it's all that remains
It's no wonder why I have not slept in days
Dust on the floor, piled up from the years, all those scars and souvenirs
Now that you're gone it's easy to see
But so hard to believe

By the way, you left without saying goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is you and me, you and me
