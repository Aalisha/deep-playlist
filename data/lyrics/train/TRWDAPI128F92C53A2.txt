Marilyn's queen of the scene
In a humble abode, by the bowling green
Marilyn, she collects names
With picture profile, computer games to hang on

In the modern world, pretty boys and girls
We've been hangin' on forever
By the radio with the afterglow
Mama told you, "Now or never"

Vampires out in the sun
Gothic girls, she's the pregnant one
Her Indian paw doesn't work
He's a trust fund straight edge soda jerk, so bang on
...
