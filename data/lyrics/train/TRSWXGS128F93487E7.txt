Keep an eye out for your soul, girl
Don't let them devils take it away
All that glitters is not gold, girl
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play

Keep an out for your soul, girl
Cause ain't nothing getting rid of the stain
The hills are dark, the hills are cold, girl
They're soaked in blood, they're draped in pain

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

Her heels clicking on the black asphalt
Her beauty's a pistol and a passport
I couldn't tell her nothin, look what her titties and her ass bought
You never asked what that cost, tell her that she can't afford it
Next thing you know she gotta have it, she can't avoid it
Champagne dreams, caviar wishes
Barely eighteen with bad intentions
Baby take heed, don't just laugh
And stress the fact I'm in the music business
Accuse me of using bitches
You're probably right, that guarantees it's the truth I'm spittin'
Trust nobody, question everything
The only thing certain is death eventually
