You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah
You know I tried, you know I tried, yeah, yeah
You know I tried, yeah you know I rally tried baby
So listen, I tried

Oh girl what I don't understand is why you wanna trip so hard?
'Cause you know I got a good full time job
And when on the road making doe
You can get anything you want from me

But what you don't understand is
That you said you'd hold me down
But now you're running around town talking 'bout I ain't shit
But baby girl I did my best
