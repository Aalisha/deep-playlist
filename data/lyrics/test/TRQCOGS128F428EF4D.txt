You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You are all of love my love
You are everything for me

You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You caught me with your charms
When you held me in your arms

Oh lonely life
I hear your heartbeat deep in the night
I need you so, now that I can't let you go
Dim all the lights and let me hold you so tight
The night is yours and mine, you're looking fine
