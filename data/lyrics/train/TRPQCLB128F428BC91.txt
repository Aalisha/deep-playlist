You wanna go where the rivers flow with liquor,
Baby, I'm a Mountain Man.
Where the wine works fine, but the herb works quicker,
Baby, I'm a Mountain Man.
Where the fish all fight and the girls are all tight,
Down where we pick that banjo and drink all night,
Baby, I'm a Mountain Man, Yeah Baby, I'm a Mountain Man.

I got nothing against where the land is flat.
You gotta grow that corn somewhere,
And you can bring it up to where I'm at.
I got 50 pounds of yeast, and some copper and wine,
We can turn that corn into something that, Lord, is fine.
Baby, I'm a Mountain Man, Yeah Baby, I'm a Mountain Man.

You wanna go where the rivers flow with liquor,
