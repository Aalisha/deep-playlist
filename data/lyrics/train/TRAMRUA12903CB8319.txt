Inside my own inner space
There's not a soul in the whole place to see or ask me why
And with my senses in shreds
There I go to pick up the loose threads
Away from your hungry eyes

And in that infinite place
You'll see a smile on my blank face
Becuase you can't get there
It's not just being alone
It's more like a view that I've half known
From hills but I don't know where

Imagination
Living mental isolation
Imagination
