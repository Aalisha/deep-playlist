I feel like pumpin' it up
Feel like pumpin' it up
We are here to pump you
Pump you up
Like hot air in a balloon, pump you up
We are here to pump you up
Me and her chose up to ride on my ten speed
Much to my dismay damn tire was flat
Country girl reached up on my Subaru
My one tire is flat too
I got a spare, don't got no jack
Oooooh
Pump it up
Oooooh
Koo koo kachoo
