In a race that never ends, never starts
We're going nowhere fast
We're heading for some trouble up ahead

Give your mind to the music, open up
Don't keep it locked inside
All in all you know what right from wrong

Who's got more money, who's getting in free
Well, who needs to be any better than the next man
Better than the next man, better than the next man

Peace of mind
