Watching the sun
Watching it come
Watching it come up
Over the rooftops
Cloudy and warm
Maybe a storm
You can never quite tell
From the morning
And it's going to be a day
There is really no way to say
No to the morning
Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to say
But come on morning
Waiting for mail
Maybe a tail
...
