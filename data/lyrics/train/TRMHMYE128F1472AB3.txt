While you carve up the children
I'll be combing the sand
Searching for bones and teeth
And soft little things
Held in soft little hands

You make me feel like a woman
I'll make you feel like a man
We'll make them all feel like bitches
While we have them eating from our hands

((I know something you don't know))

We'll be calling a roll call
For people weak in the knees
And then we'll call them all liars
Because we do as we damn well please
