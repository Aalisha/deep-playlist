I think I caught your fever
I felt it right away
I had the urge to tell you
But I still shyed away
& since you never told me
Then how was I to know
That you felt like me
To the third degree
& you didn't wanna let me go

The closer that you get to me
The more I wanna make you see
That you'll never find a love like mine
I think about you all the time
The closer that I get to you
The less I feel I have to prove
That you'll never find a love like mine
I really need you in my life
Closer
