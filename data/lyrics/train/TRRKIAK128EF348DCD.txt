Watch the seconds turn to hours
See the sunshine turn to shadows
It could be so easy
If I just had time
Baby please believe me
You're always on my mind
We could work it out
If we just had time

Can't stop the wheels are turning
Can't stop the fire from burning
Can't give when I should say
Can't take to try somebody
Can't stop the wheels from turning
