There are things that happen
To certain people when they're finally dead
Many never end up resting in their deserved casket bed
Cadavers in the wrong hands
Can come up for grabs
Join the countless corpses
On the mortuary auction slabs
The dead become a hot commodity, ready to sell
Merchandise on a market straight from hell
Price tags
Replace morgue tags

Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
...
