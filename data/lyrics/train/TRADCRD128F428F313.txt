I can spell it in your eyes
i can feel it in my hands
i can taste it in your mouth
i can hear it in my head
make it happen
make it happen
I can spell it in your eyes
i can feel it in my hands
i can taste it in your mouth
i can hear it in my head
make it happen
make it happen
Cocoa pops in the story
and i'm here all alone
asked for what i'm missing
drinking words on the telephone
Cocoa pops in the story
and i'm here all alone
asked for what i'm missing
drinking words on the telephone
