Getting lost up in the music
Getting lost up in the music

Give me one more lie that's all I need
One of those alibis you feed to me
'Cause that's my motivation, boy, that's the key
Every time my heart breaks, more energy

Tell me how them girls don't mean a thing
And how you only have them eyes for me
Then buy me some more flowers when you get caught
Another empty promise fresh out the box

You think I'm drowning in my sorrow
You'll be forgotten by tomorrow

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here
 (Getting lost up in the music)
Dancing off my tears
 (Getting lost up in the music)

Thank you for the heartbreak
I guess all that I needed was some heartbreak
Or I wouldn't be here
 (Getting lost up in the music)
Dancing off my tears
 (If I stop then I might lose it)
