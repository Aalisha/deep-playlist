The wheels of life are turning
I feel I'm rolling down this track
And I know down deep inside my heart
I can't look back

And though it's hard discerning
All of the fiction from the fact
You have led me to this truth
And we have made a pact

And as we go through highs and lows
And all that's in between
It's good to know we're not alone on this
big scream machine
...
