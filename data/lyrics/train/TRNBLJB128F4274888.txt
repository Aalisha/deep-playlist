You could be a good girl,
He could be a great guy,
Same rules apply.
Do or Die.

You could love her one day,
Hate him on the next day.
No one really knows when or why, Baby.

You had a hard day at work,
She had a hard day too.
And now you both have an attitude, yeah.
But just remember that you both love each other very much.
So go ahead and make up.

Chorus
No matter how hard you try.
There ain’t no gettin’ by the hard times.
It’s always gonna be somethin’.
No matter how positive you live,
Or how much love you give.
I’m telling you…
It’s always gonna be somethin’.
Always one thing after another,
Just keep livin’ you’ll discover.
You can’t let it stress you out.
It’s just a part of life.
I’m tellin’ you…
It’s always gonna be somethin’.
