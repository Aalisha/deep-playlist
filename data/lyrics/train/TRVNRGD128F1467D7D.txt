I heard a girl in a dress
Say her face was a mess
I heard there's no reason why
I heard that now's the time to buy

On planet earth
I'll probably stay
On planet earth
It's a place to live your life

Where pleasure follows pain
People go insane, fly around in planes
Pray that it won't rain, drive around in cars
Get drunk in local bars, dream of being stars
Well I lived all my life on planet earth
