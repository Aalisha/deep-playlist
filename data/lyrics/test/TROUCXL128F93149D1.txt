Seven years beyond 2000 years we’re just cruising.
This is music that’s been travelling light-years to brace your beards.
We’re just cruising.

I’m just thinking to myself.
You know there is no one here to help.
I try thinking a plan up by my own.
But I could never fix this all alone 
(We’re just cruising).
If you never do a thing 
(We’re just cruising).
There is always something you can bring 
(We’re just cruising).
If you can’t look at the king 
(We’re just cruising).
That’s right, we’re just cruising through.

You give a lot of love, but you don’t know why.
The revolution stops if you walk on by.
You give a lot of love, it will get you high.
But talk is not enough, you believe the lie.

You give a lot of love, but you don’t know why.
The revolution stops if you walk on by.
You give a lot of love, it will get you high.
