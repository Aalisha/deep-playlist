Have they put out all the fires yet
now the celebration's done.
I hope you'll come to see me
before the summer's gone.
My mind still lives in your time ÃŠ
my spirit's up and down.
I tried to find some old friends
but nobody's around.

Can't understand it
I got my signals crossed.
I thought I could do it
but already I've had enough.

The buildings they're so graceful here
they barely touch the sky.
Sometimes it's so quiet
you can hear your neighbours cry.
