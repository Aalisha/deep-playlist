Thousands of united states soldiers descended upon the tiny nation of Vietnam
they did not know what lay ahead but selflessly laid down their lives.
Fighting on foreign soil we carry out our duty no matter what we see or hear.
Question our right to be here reassured by empowered men
that we were acting nobly for the good of the common man.
Fighting a war against oppression in a hostile land.
Watching as friends lay dead and dying saving who we can.
A nation tears itself apart half a world away.
Ungrateful for the sacrifices we bore ON THEIR BEHALF.
We bled the ground deep red.
Died too young embraced our death.
