When I'm driving in my car, I don't care about any thing
When I'm speeding in my car, I don't care about anyone
Man and machine, machine and man
We're always together they can't understand
Give anything for her velvet seats
Do anything just to hear her squeal
Man and machine, machine and man
We're always together they can't understand
My foot's on the pedal, such a crazy thing
