Baby, here I am
I'm a girl on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I've got some good old loving
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
You got to come back for more

Girls and things will come by the dozen
That ain't nothing but drugstore loving
Pretty little thing
Let me light your candle
Cause, baby, I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Actions speak louder than words
And I'm a girl with a great experience
I know you got another girl
But I can love you better than she can
