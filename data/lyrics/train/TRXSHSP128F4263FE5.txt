Give me your heart and I will make you a promise
Give me your soul and I will be by your side
Forever girl and forever girl
Give me the time and I will savour each moment
Give me the chance to share the pain with the pleasure
Forever girl and forever girl

So how can love be mistaken for a one night love affair
Oh Yeah
So how can love be mistaken
Can't you see girl that it's more than just a one night stand to me
more than just a one night stand (Yeah Yeah)
more than just a one night stand (Yeah Yeah)

You got the look that bring the man out of me
You got the smile that lights the world full of darkness
Forever girl
And Forever girl
