Newtown where everybody goes around sniffing televisena
Or taking footballina
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown

Gimme another fix
Gimme another fix
If not I'll go sick
If not I'll go sick
I'll be sick

Morning papers will bring you something flash
Make your bones shake and keep busy your mind
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown
Newtown

Gimme another fix
