Oh, oh
I’m not missing you

Been through just about everything that I could go through
When it comes to relationships
Don’t know what I was missing or why I ain’t listen
When I told myself that was it

Now here I go, hurt again
'Cause of my curiosity
Now that it’s over
What else could it be decisive it is

I made a promise never to settle
Why didn’t I keep it?
'Cause I hated the heartbreak
Crying and cheating, the fooling around

But I’m not missing you
I’m not going through the motions
Waiting and hoping you call me
I’m not missing you
You might have had me open
But I must be going because

I got life to do
I know I’m usually hanging on
I used to hate to see you gone
But this time it’s different
I don’t even feel the distance
I’m not missing, I’m not missing you

It’s a shame in a way
'Cause I feel that I may not
Ever find the right one for me
Did I leave him, is he right in front of my face oh

Will my true love ever be?
