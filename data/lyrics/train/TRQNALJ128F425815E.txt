GO!

Residing pack of goods, smoking nighty-nine
were having laughs, and the time of our life
to mock the hell yea, life on the road
I'll fucking blow your hands off, before the first show

Punk Rock Ambulance! get me down
Punk Rock Ambulance! we start to frown
Punk Rock Ambulance! get him up quick
Punk Rock Ambulance! the colonies sick,
give him a brake, the terry struck, where the spector spits

burning pots n'pans up on the grass,
in New York City, where the stewarts can kiss my ass,
and now were off to, mainward to south
and now were soon to become, and let the four drive

Punk Rock Ambulance! get me down
Punk Rock Ambulance! we start to frown
...
