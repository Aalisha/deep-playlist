Head

Thank you for the way you try to say
There must be another kind of day
Thank you for the almost sudden attempt
It is so right.

Thank you for this lovely sort of play
Emily is just a name to say
Thank you for the almost sudden attempt
It seems so right.

And then we will believe there's just something for me
