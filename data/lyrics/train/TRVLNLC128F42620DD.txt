Well, when I was young
My momma read me nursery rhymes beside my bed
And though they sounded mighty fine
They made no sense to me

And now that I am all grown up
It seems my nights have changed as such
So I went out and made me up
A nursery rhyme for me

It goes barlight, bar bright
First bar that I see tonight
Wish I may, wish I might
Find someone to hold me tight

Hey diddle diddle, a man with a fiddle
And the girls sing along with the tunes
Just a one more dance 'til you turn off the lights
And you can shut down this saloon

You know, I never understood
...
