Well, anywhere I go it's you, I'm not done with you
Tell me what you wanna do, never been afraid of you
Just because you walk around, everyone you're talking down
Don't you even make a sound, I will drop you to the ground

Hey you, better watch with the stare
I see you coming undone
Come on, come on, come on and get some

Hey you, better watch with the stare
I see you coming undone
Come on, come on, come on and get some

Come on and get some
Come on and get some

Well, I lie day by day to the point that I might stray
Never seen this side of me, let the anger out of me
Just because I've been reserved, playing things you've never heard
Doesn't mean I'm not aware, if you push I'll take you there
