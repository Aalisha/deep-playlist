[Solo: Shermann]

There's a little old man
standing by my window
There's a little old man
hiding in the shadows

The uninvited guest, could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again

There's a little old man
I'd say he looks like Misery
There's a little old man
I could really use his company

The uninvited guest, could never have been a friend
