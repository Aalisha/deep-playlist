Miracle Man
You're Miracle Man

Save me from the outside
Save me from the hurt
Save me from this cold inside and
Save me from myself

What you see when you're looking at me
Take me out, take me out of captivity
Got my head, my dreams, my dead my screams
Started up the engin of the afterlife machine

I've got your head and your covenant of dreams (I've got your head)
I've got your dead and a collection of your screams

Not your ordinary bout with madness
I'm in love with the infinite sadness
Can you see clear to save me, save me
From myself, save me
