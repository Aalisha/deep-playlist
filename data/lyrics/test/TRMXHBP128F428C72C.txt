Oh yea yes
OOh
can i talk to you
for a minute
There's something on my mind
that i wanna say

Oh Reality is, taking control of me cause i know, baby
I Know that you loving me
Oh loving you boy
I wanna contradict my word
I belong with you, I do truly wanna know(wanna know)

When you hear me taking, watcha think
When you looking into my eyes, watcha see
I know you ain't tryna to be my man
Watcha think about us bein friends, making plans
To be everything we wanna be, making ours dreams turn reality
I'm digging everything you appear to be
