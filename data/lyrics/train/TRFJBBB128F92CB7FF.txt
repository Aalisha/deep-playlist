Lately love, keeps keeping me waking up
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss, wanna hold you so tight
Ooh, but I wonder, love, whether you know or not?
When you just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me
But you fly away almost everyday
You work a lot, you never stop to love

Stop, I love you, stop, stop
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate
The love we got, stop
Say you're coming home
Gotta stop to love, yeah

You say, my love has always been
On your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?

Too many empty nights
Could make almost any guy
