Your daddy beat you up
Your daddy beat you down
Your daddy put your mama in the hospital
Your daddy left town... he broke your heart
Your mama drank too much
Your mama hit you in the face
You had to make excuses for the bruises to all your friends
You had to live in disgrace... She broke your heart
Daddy came in your room at night
He took whatever he want
Your daddy was your first time
And your mama never tried to stop him... they
broke your heart
My mama beat me up
My mama beat me down
My brother raped my sister
My family threw me out... they broke my heart
America is the place where the kids got broken hearts
America is the place where the kids got twisted minds
bent on self destruction
