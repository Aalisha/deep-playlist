Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
We living in the positive
And I know Good will conquer evil
Jah is here amidst the battle
And I know Love will overcome hatred
Oh uh yeah
We living in the positive
Oh children
Let not your hearts be troubled
Wipe away your tears and fears
Cause I know Love
Will conquer evil
Who uh yeeaahh!

And even through my darkest nights - oy
Fear not, Jah is on my side, to protect I
And even though the odds
Are against I
Lord oh Lord, Lord yeeahh!
Fear not, though my chances are slim
Yet my hopes are so high

We living in the positive
And I know good will conquer evil
...
