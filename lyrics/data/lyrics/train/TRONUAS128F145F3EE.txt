Love can't be measured with diamonds and gold
Before you spend your money I oughta let you know
If you wanna get to me, try the little things

Don't need that mansion on top of the hill
Too many rooms with nothing to fill
You can't furnish me with the little things

Rub my back, make me laugh
Hold me while I dream
All it takes to make my day
Is to tell me you love me, little things
