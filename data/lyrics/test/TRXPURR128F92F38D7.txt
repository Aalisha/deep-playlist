So many obstacles
(so many obstacles)
Gettin in the way
(gettin in the way)
So many obstacles in the way
That keep interupting what i truely want to say
We've become the closest friends
And by no means do i want that to ever end
The problem is
The last man that had your heart well he's an old friend of mine
Even if he's not on ya mind
Steppin to you that way just seems so out of line
But if we step past this transition
There is so much we'll be missing in our lives
Such as you and I
