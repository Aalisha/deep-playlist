Days had come, winters had gone,
and we gambolled like siblings in paradise.
I was your knight, holding you tight
as a brother when I saw your crying eyes.
Time went by, and we had to say goodbye.

Staring up to the clouds above,
children so little and sad.
Hoping the saints could help one day,
lead us together again.
Holding the key to the alley of dreams still in hands.

Time telling me to say farewell,
but I knew that I would fight hell,
and I know we will!
Go, for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free
for no more farewell!

Time telling me to say farewell,
but I knew that I would fight hell,
and I know we will!
Go, for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free
for no more farewell!

Stepbrother, tell me where have you been
when they brought me to this godforsaken place?
Sign of the cross, they took me away
for healing with herbs by the way of grace.
Now I wait for the day to feed the flames.
