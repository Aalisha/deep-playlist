Sleeping with your eyes wide open but closed inside,
Where light and darkness both are blinding,
The novella you write painted with the brush of night,
That never has a happy ending.

Decisions will make you or break you,
Don't let them pull away.

Made a wish upon a falling star,
Ran so fast you don't know where you are,
Wake up friend,
It's just one life,
It's not too late,
Your ride is far from over!
