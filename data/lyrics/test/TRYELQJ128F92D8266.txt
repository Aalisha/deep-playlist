Talking loud, she's talking clear
But no one really wants to hear
No one really wants to know
And her loneliness still grows
Was it shame or was it fear
When his devil's face appeared?

And the wall between them grows
The wall between them grows
Tonight, velvet night

He met her on the school yard
Funny man behind the fence
Started with a real deception
