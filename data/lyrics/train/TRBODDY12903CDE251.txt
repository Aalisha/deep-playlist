A crumbling empire
Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization
A society ripped to shreds

No semblance of order
Into the world which I abjure
Where the bloody blade is forged
Am I the cause of the cure?

Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight

(Downfall)
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sown
