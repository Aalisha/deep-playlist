A la la la la la la la la la la
Oohh, oooh yeah

You walk up to me and say 'Feel like I know ya, baby'
And then take a sip of your cherry coke
Now, now who drinks a cherry coke
Maybe your nervous
I see that bead of sweat dancing on your cheek
Your words are like cheap champagne (cheap champagne)
I get the point but its much too sweet

I'm so tired of the dance
This carousel of superficial conversation gets me nowhere

So you can see my bra, underneath my shirt
Watch the wind, underneath my skirt
But that ain't the picture it's just a part
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart

See my eyes, don't see what I see
Touch my tongue, don't know what tastes good to me
Its the human condition that keeps us apart
Everybody's got a story that could break your heart
Yeah everybody's got a story that could break your heart

Lalalalalalalananana

Now who can read the mind of the redheaded girl next door
Or the taxi driver who just dropped you off
...
