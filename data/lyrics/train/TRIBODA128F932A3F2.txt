Never could believe the things you do to me
Never could believe the way you are
Every day I bless the day that you got through to me
'Cause baby, I believe that you're a star

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)
Let's do it again
