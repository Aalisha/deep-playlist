ha-ha ha-ha Laugh out loud ha-ha hahaha laugh out loud

The day I left my mother and my father and my sister
looking for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
found it so-o-o bori-ing
You see my life revolved around a longa terma lover
Music was his name had no time for any other
intrests This was my whole life

"You can't sing
If you want to make a living
Stop dreaming"
as a little girl
I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling oh help me sing it now
1-2 whats a girl to do i said
3-4 i'm gonna laugh some more c'mon
5-6 i'm getting a stich
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
1-2 whats a girl to do i said
3-4 i'm gonna laugh some more c'mon
5-6 i'm a getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
Now times have changed, I find myself involved with another
