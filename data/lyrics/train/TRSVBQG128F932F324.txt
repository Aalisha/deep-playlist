We follow the tail lights out of the city
Moving in a river of red
As the colors fade away from the dusky sunset
We roll for the darkness ahead

We are old, we are young, we are in this together
Vagabonds and children, prisoners forever
With pulses a-raging and eyes full of wonder
Kicking out behind us again

Night time, city beat, the radio is calling
The lost and lonely in vain
Out here we are running for the wide open spaces
The road smell after the rain
...
