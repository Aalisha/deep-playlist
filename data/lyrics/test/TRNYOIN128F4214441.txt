5 a.m., rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest and time to play
15, the mother is a runaway

No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold
So her child can eat

What is happening
To this world we live in
In our home and other lands

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
