She took a fall it was crucial
Counted her out before they gave her a chance
{To get up}
The underdog, same as usual
Everyones watching and the pressure, it just won't let up
Tell me, I wantcha to, I wantcha to think that I
{Drowning in myself}
But baby no
{Noo}
After what I've been through
Lesson learned, story told, I know that

[Chorus 1:]
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
See that, now I know, nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
Takin' back my self control
Nothing is impossible

[Chorus 2: x2]
Nothings Impossible
Impossible
