Take me to the heart of the city
Where the people are pretty
And the music is loud

Late at night I feel connected
The lights are bright, it's so electric with you
When I'm with you

Kiss me like you do in my dreams
Make me feel like I was seventeen
Don't stop it now 'cause I like it
Don't think about it, don't deny me

Kiss me now, don't let me go
Make me feel like Marilyn Monroe
Don't stop it now 'cause I like it
Don't think about it, don't deny me

Your kiss is sweeter than honey
All over my body
...
