I took a bite out of a mountain range,
Thought my teeth would break, the mountain did...
Let's go, I want to go
All the way to the horizon...

I took a drink out of the ocean and I'm treading water there before I drown
Let's dive, I want to dive
To the bottom of the ocean

Took a ride, I took a ride,
I wouldn't go there without you.
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride,
I wouldn't leave here without you.

I am a mountain.
I am the sea.
You can't take that away from me...
I am a mountain.
I am the sea.
You can't take that away from me...
...
