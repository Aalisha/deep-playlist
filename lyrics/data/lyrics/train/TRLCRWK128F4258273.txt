Russell's new uptight trust-fund princess reigns
Stares down her coke-burned nose and sets new rules
Forbids his listening to punk rock music
Tried to burn his copy of The People's History

His face is blank, bloodless, inexpressive,
All passion drained by the unhallowed leech

Last Call for Russell's Balls
The Demon must be fed
Last Call for Russell's Balls
They're hanging by a thread

Russell says it's true love more like sick games
