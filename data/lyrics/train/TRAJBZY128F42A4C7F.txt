What's up motherfuckers, it's the show stopper Lil Yo dropper
Kappo popper, bout to break them off something proper

Young Capo, bitch you ain't young no mo'
You a old man, why you still riding with Lil Yo
You need to get off Pac dick, and stop that copying shit
Boy you ain't no OG, over there in the bricks
Old hating ass nigga, talking bout you bust on me

I'm the fucking Boss, against all odds
Lil' Zane ass niggaz, y'all some broads and frauds
I'll pull your hoe card, snake skin ass bitch
I don't even know you nigga, so I'm making it quick

All you gay ass niggaz, need to get on your toes
