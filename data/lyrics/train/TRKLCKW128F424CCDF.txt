Remember
Remember this passionate love
So innocent
We lived an immortal life

The pain still lingers
From this weird embrace
We still bear the marks
Of our vows and vices

Come with me
And rejouce in my tears
Let our bodies be one
In this last embrace
And the fruit of this union
Will live for ever

Heartbeats
Remembrance of suffering
This birth will bring
...
