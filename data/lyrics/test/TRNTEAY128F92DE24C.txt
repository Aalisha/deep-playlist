Sergeant,
Sergeant, please
The men around here won't send me no ease
And I'm wild about my lovin', and I like my fun
Oh yeah
If you want me to be a girl of yours, babe
Bring it with you when you come

He ain't no Iceman, no iceman's son
But he can sure keep me cool 'til my iceman comes
And I'm wild about my lovin', and I like my fun
Oh yeah
...
