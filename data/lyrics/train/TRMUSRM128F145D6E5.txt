Your smiles they don't come easy
Like they used to come before
The awkwardness and boredom
Is scattered out across the floor
I can feel your love waxin' and wanin'
And a quick look in your eyes needs no explainin'

I'm out on my own
Livin' alone

I'm an old reluctant gypsy
I don't like campin' anymore
And the dreams and disappointments
Scatter out across the floor
...
