Passed out on the overpass, Sunday best and broken glass
Broken down from the bikes and bars
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight
And tonight will go on forever while we
Walk around this town like we own the streets
And stay awake through summer like we own the heat
Singing Everybody wake up (Wake up)
It's time to get down. (Everybody wake up, it's time to get down)
And when I pass the bottle back to Pete
on the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh

I'm gonna stay eighteen forever (Cut me open)
So we can stay like this forever (Sun poisoned)
And we'll never miss a party (This offer...)
'Cause we keep them going constantly (...Stands forever)
And we'll never have to listen (New haircut)
To anyone about anything (New Bracelet)
'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said (Eyeliner)
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
