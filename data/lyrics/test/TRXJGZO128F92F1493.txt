Stepping off the blue line I revert back to the time
She would stand by the bus terminal
Asking for change reading leftist literature
From the north shore out to the west side
Searching for herself but now on her own dime
Dressed in rags from a resale outlet
Living in a dump she would learn to forget
Thought that she would save the world
A spoiled rotten little girl
An art school dropout/won't fall in-won't fall out
