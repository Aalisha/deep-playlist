Smile-when you face suspect, corrupt, degenerate, merchants of melody
Smile-when you need respect, all you get is nails and poison from lizards tails
Smile-like the smart, sofisticate burnout sisters of hollow high harmonies
Smile-like the jester who knows what's expected, you smile in the face of your enemy
Fire-It's the sense of justice, the flame that light up the truth when time is done

Fire-He can see a spark in the starless night of this cold and heartless town
Fire-So he can put it out, see them everywhere standing by to bring you down
