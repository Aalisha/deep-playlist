We pretend to be afraid
Underneath our twilight
Missing everything we were
Missing something just like

In the passing of our night
Softly reaching out for
A breath of silence within our pride
Pretending just like

Taken in
Taken far away to be as we once were
To be as we once believed in

Not in words
Not in fairytales
Not in silence or in front of you
With nightmares like these
