Love the life you live
Lead the life you love
Love the life you live
Lead the life you love
You should lead the life you love
You should lead the life you love

World is in trouble
Arm a geddon shall show her face
Upon creation
Goodness and mercy
Driven from the minds of the people
Lamentation
Jah Sire deliver me
Jah Sire have mercy
Jah Sire Father send I some
goodness and mercy

It a go murder them a go charge for
A pure chemical industry
Them a run from cultivation
Goodness and mercy
Driven from the minds of the people
Lamentation
Jah Sire deliver me
Jah Sire have mercy
Jah Sire Father send I some
goodness and mercy
Send I some goodness
Send I some goodness and mercy

Love the life you live
Lead the life you love
Love the life you live
Lead the life you love
Lead the life you love

The mountains of Africa
