If God was a woman
with long blond hair
would you kneel at her altar
and offer her prayer
could she be your addiction
could she make you sin
If God was a woman
and you were her man
If God was a woman
would you be impressed
if she showed up in high heels
and a pretty red dress
would you make a donation
or would you draw the line
would you yield to temptation
or savor her wine
If God was a woman
she'd come like an angel
or a devil in disguise
...
