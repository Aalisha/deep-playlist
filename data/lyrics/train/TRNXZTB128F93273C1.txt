[Egg]
You feel it pumping and it's in your face
You feel it pumping and it's in your face
You feel it pumping and it's in your face
I've got a 3-D Super Woofer, now turn up the bass
[Rhys]
All I ever wanted at the age of nine
Was a cassette player that was mine
To play my rap tapes to all my mates
So for Christmas and birthdays I'd waits and waits
Then one day, you know what I was given
Off my cousin who was run over and killed up in Llanishen
A Super Woofer of the 3-D kind
Double cassette and it was all my mine
Sometimes I think they were the best days
Sometimes I think they were the best days
Sometimes I think they were the best days
When I'd spend my time pressing rewind and plays
[Chorus]
3-D Super Woofer, double cassette
Those are the days I will never forget
3-D Super Woofer, auto reverse
That was the chorus, now back to the verse
[Egg]
Clap your hands everybody if you've got what it takes
Cos here's the boombox and these are the tapes
Maxell, Sony, TDK,
I keep them in a box and never throw them away
Stop, play, pause, rewind
I turn it up loud when I'm out of my mind
So fucking big that it can't be stolen
Like a medical experiment your head gets swollen
