I speak my mind, I don't hold it back
That's how I am, and I'm hopin' that's where you at
Like I lay it on the line and that's how it should be
If you're gonna make it, man you've got to agree

I'm a stone cold believer, yes I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man
