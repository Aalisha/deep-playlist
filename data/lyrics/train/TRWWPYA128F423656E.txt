504 BOYZ
Miscellaneous
Everywhere I Go"(feat. Curren$y
[Curren$y]
A lot of niggas is saying they don't like me
Because I flow so tightly, my wrist wear glow so brightly
But I ain't gonna quit, niggas know I go hard
And a dog don't settle for shit
You might see me on the block, but if I see the police
I break out, cause I'm allergic to the cops
I just put up a 7-20's on the drop, I'm fin to take a vacation
With a couple of honies on the yacht
I be the don of this rap shit, and my album going platinum
Y'all niggas is going double plastic
Shit'll get tragic, if one of you fools
Choose to make me use my automatic
Click-clack-blow, Curren$y the Hot Spitter
