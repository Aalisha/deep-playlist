"The Winged Painter is on uptown," I said
"Will you meet me to go, to go, to go"
Washington Square
I'm racing there
To get you at Noon
Oh the Nocturne noon
Isabella on the way there stops me
(I say) I can't stay today
I'm off in flight
Towards Another Light
Rest
Youth
Washington Square
I meet you there
And we go

And he's on the run
He's on the run
From this walking Greeting Card
And Chloe's Kiss
The Wolf Pit
The Wine Harvest
And Phileda's Lesson
We're not his possession
In Winter
Trampled flowers
In Winter
...
