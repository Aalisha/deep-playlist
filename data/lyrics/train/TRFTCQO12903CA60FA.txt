Wonderful, is the feeling that I get
Whenever I'm around you
A river of love, flow oh so deep
You must be, angel sent, descended from above
It's truly a blessing yeah, to have your precious love
To imagine life here without you
Would be impossible, you're like the air I breath
There's

There are no words to explain
The way I'm feeling you
Better than love
We make Heaven
Nothing can compare
To these feelings oh so rare
Better than love
We make Heaven

Beautiful, you are to me girl
You're love is all I need for
It's not hard, for me to give you all I have
