Ahhhh...
The Lord is a monkey
Thanksgiving's coming on the Fourth of July
In the form of a girl with a needle in her eye
Well she come from out west on a nickel worth of gas
Got her mind on her money and her dope up her ass
Outside of Phoenix she was kinda broke down
Burned a cracker-boy rig and she was out of that town.
Ha Ha Ha!
