OH NO (CHICO DEBARGE)
INTRO
OH NO, Da Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da Da Da(REPEAT3 TIMES)
VERSE
Miles away, I wanna take you baby
I wanna take you baby, baby baby
Danger to love, a stranger to the arms of God
A Stranger to the arms of love babe
But you're such an amazing soul, I just had to let you know
You're like seraphim, you're such a precious gem- OH NO
Hook
Help me a brother out, elevate with me baby, tell me what it's all about, woh-Oh NO
You know I wanna be with you, I'm loving everything you do baby,
