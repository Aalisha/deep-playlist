Just let me get it ahh
Just let me get it get it

Let's ride, Let's ride
One time

I don't mean to make you sound cheap
By asking you to be my freak
But what if, see what you start babe
Up and down with mine, babe
Here's my beeper number
Give me a call
Tell you man, that you're goin, to the mall
So we can be alone
So he won't have to know
I keep his coffee warm

We can get sexual, get sexual
Noone has to know
It's you and me, and me
He won't know, she won't know, about us

We can get sexual, get sexual
Just give me a call, get sexual
And we'll be on, alright
On the down low, baby

I can't beleive your serious
