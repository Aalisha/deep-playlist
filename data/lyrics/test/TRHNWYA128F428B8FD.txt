ai no corrida
that's where i am
you sent me there
your dream is my command

ai no corrida
that's where i am
you sent me there
your dream is my command

ai no corrida
that's where i am
you sent me there
your dream is my command

ai no corrida
that's where i am (that's where i am)
you sent me there (you sent me there)
your dream is my command

ai no corrida
that's where i am (that's where i am)
you sent me there (you sent me there)
your dream is my command

(you and nothing else)

i hold you
i touch you
in a maze can't find my way
iÂ ? you
i drink you
im being served you on a tray
you see boy
this is what i go through everyday
is this the way it should feel?

ai no corrida
that's where i am
you sent me there
just you and nothing else
