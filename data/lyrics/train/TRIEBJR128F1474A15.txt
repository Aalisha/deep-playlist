How am I supposed to let go of this feeling?
How am I supposed to erase this image of your sweet face?
When it seems like just yesterday

We made a promise of love that I'm about to break
How do I walk away after all these years?
And all I can give you is a song for your tears

Now we both know the light of our love has been fading
When I come home, tell you about my day
You don't hear a word that I say
