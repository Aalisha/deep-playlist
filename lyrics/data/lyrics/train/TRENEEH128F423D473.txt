You've spent too much time sat in your bedroom
On your PC, are you sure that you couldn't
Have found the time
Swallowed your pride and fitted to jealousy
Well next week, you're trying again
To pull one of your city's men from men
If you not had the internet would you be into them?
I very much doubt so, how would they know so?

What took you so long?
Was there a queue at the post office?
What took you so long?
Was there a dirty double decker stage coach
You just happened to miss

Sometimes I'm bad and sometimes I'm rotten
