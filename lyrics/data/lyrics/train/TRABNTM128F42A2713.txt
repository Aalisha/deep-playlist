Well, I've been thinkin', like you've been drinkin'
But, I know thinkin' is the last thing on your mind.
But, I've been hopin', to get this out in the open.
And hopin' we ain't runnin' out of time.
The book I've been reading says we need to work this out.
We need to talk about our problems, if we got 'em.
I think I've got a drinkin' problem.

I can't hardly get out of bed, I can't hardly clear my head.
Of last night's spinning, smokey memories.
I call in sick to work, I tell 'em my whole body hurts.
