You say it's hard to read me
I make it hard for you
I'm not that easy
It's a strength you can't undo

Your mind ain't playing tricks
And neither am I
Well, this ain't more than kicks
I like your kind, kind

Ooh, you're askin' for trouble
Don't come around again
Ooh, you're askin' for trouble
Don't come around again

I live alone
And I got no more room
And I won't get my peace
Till I'm in my tomb

I'm warnin' you
...
