Listen to old John goin' on and on
About his glory days
But then the ball slips through his finger tips
The seconds tick away
That's one football game he'd love to replay

Then there's Ruby Jean, well, she can really sing
But she's stuck in this bar
She thinks some big wheel out of Nashville
Come and make her a star
Who am I to talk? I'm the worst of them all
