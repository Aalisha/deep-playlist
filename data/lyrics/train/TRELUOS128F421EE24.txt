Come on around to my house mama, ain't nobody there but me
Call me a hotshot rider and a cheater, colored from Tennessee
Take it easy, don't get rough, just wanna tell you that I know my stuff

Come on around to my house mama, ain't nobody home but me
In the evening, ain't nobody home but me
In the morning, ain't nobody there but me

Come on around to my house mama, ain't nobody there but me
That's why you hear me screaming and crying, going back to Tennessee
Can't read and write, can't spell my name, I can really drive your man's heart insane

Come on around to my house mama, ain't nobody home but me
