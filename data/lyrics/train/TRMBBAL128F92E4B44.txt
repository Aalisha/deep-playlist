I woke up this morning
I had a scone and a large house blend
Then a little conversation
With my squirrel and chipmunk friends
I said I'm sick and tired of winter
And I wish that it was spring
Then a little fella named Robin Redbreast began to sing

And he sang:
Ooh child, what you think, the cold winter's gonna last forever?
Ooh child, now's the time for all the people to get together
Outside

'Cause it's the First of May
First of May
Outdoor fucking starts today
So bring your favorite lady
Or at least your favorite lay
Water's not cold, baby, dip in your big toe
Maybe I'll see you in flagrante delicto
Grass below you, sky above
Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called
Fucking outside

I thanked him for the information
