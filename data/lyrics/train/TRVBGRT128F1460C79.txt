(Intro)
Thank You Lord
It's gon' be aight though (ohh)
This one's for you, yeah!
Cadillacs on 22s...22s...22s...
Pimp my voice and mack these beats...
Pray to the Lord...
Mississippi...

(Chorus - repeat 2x)
Cadillacs on 22s
I ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
Pimp my voice and mack these beats and
Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets, hey!

(Verse)
God I know that we pimp

God I know I should talk about you mo' in all my songs
I know these kids are listening
