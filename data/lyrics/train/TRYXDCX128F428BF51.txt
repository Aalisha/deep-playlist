I walked down to the park where I once played
The trees have been uprooted
No grass, just brick, a factory
And a stench that fills the air
And the stream nearby
Where we laughed and cried
Has sadly been polluted
I stand stunned, my body is numb
Nobody seems to care
CRISIS MAN-Crisis of a generation
