What you gonna play now
Get on up, get on up, get on up, get on up

Every geto got a different name, but they all the same
So Coolio loco gonna put you up on game
We got homies who sell straps, homies who sell crack
Homies who sell the bomb chronic sacks thats a fact

'Cause you from the neighborhood, niggas love
Pimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, ganstas and thugs
To unwrap the strap [Incomprehensible] what
The loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck

And broke all of the [Incomprehensible] where the big G's live
The little homie be gettin' out on account
This time he might get stuck attempted
One eight seven and he's a minor with pride

So the D A want him tried as an adult
The big homey just had a son, no joking
I think his baby's mom is smoking 'cause she always broke
And the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy
And everybody and their momma talking 'bout O.J. defense

To the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras
Young niggas fightin' their case with public defenders
Be your own good ride, right, right
These are the geto highlites

To the niggas who smokin' indo chocolate, tired of stress
Niggas, who got warrants out for their arrest
Be your own good ride, right, right
These are the geto highlites

Slap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin'
Dead cats in the street playing craps
Niggas, catchin' dice with they feet
Think they got the funk, that one fool got stoked out
