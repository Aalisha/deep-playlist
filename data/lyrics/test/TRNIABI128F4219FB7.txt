So come on down and try your hand at the oldest game in town
Pull up a chair and don't be scared, youve got to play it round by round
Spin the wheel and take a hit it doesnt matter what you chose
Sou can sink your battle ship but theres a good chance you will loose

A little lady walking down the street
And she was born in a good and nice town
You think youve got what it takes to be her man
So you try about and ask a lady if she would like to meet
