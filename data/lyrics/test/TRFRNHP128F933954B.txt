Rainbow Country
Bob Marley

Hey Mr. Music 
Ya sure sound good to me
I can't refuse it 
What got to be, got to be 

Feel like dancing 
Dance cause we are free 

I got my home
In the promise land 
But I feel at home 
Can you overstand 

Said the road is rocky
sure feels good to me
and if your lucky
together we'd always be

Are you really rideing?
the sun is a risin'
the sign is a risin'
Moon is rising

Are you really rideing?
Are you really rideing?

Are you really rideing?
Are you really rideing?

rainbow country
rainbow country

rainbow country
rainbow country
