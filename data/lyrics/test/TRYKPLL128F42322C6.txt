This is the time, this is the moment we shine, the moment we climb
There's moments in life where we follow, we fly but I'm still trying to find that sky
Looking for a reason to listen to me
Let me just give you some pieces of me
Let me just take out my heart that maybe you'll see that I'm not Superman that I really do bleed
Man I'll give you that thing that repeats in your car
But I'll give you that music to heal every scar
Look to the sky and I pray to the stars, find out that myself I've been trapped in the dark
And I know what it is that I'm here to do
Is this really the person I'm supposed to be?
Trying to give you all my story but I can never find the words cause I don't know me
I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm mad and it's all because of this past
When every kid in your school believes you can do it but really thinks that you're trash
When you got friends that say, "we'll always be there"â€¦ I look around, where you at?
It's like you all got up and left; onto the next
What was my chance to pack?!
Putting in effort but I should've known better but being alone is just nothing but pressure
Through my endeavors I'm piecing this letter to every kid trying to hold it together
This life is just long, and I'm just from the street
Even the strongest of man will fall weak
But with all the pain and the hurt, the tears on your shirt
That's what finding happiness means
And now you probably think I got this all down
But I don't even know what I'm doing right now
When you're giving your best till your last breath
There's a time where you just want to drown
Picked up myself from the cold hard ground
Friends don't believe what I'm doing right now
Teachers telling me to pull all this right down
Got this whole time to turn this whole life around
