Got your hand up all in my shirt
And you know that it hurts
Ball and chain
Ball and chain

Crossing the street you look so fine
Making up everything that's in my mind
You're my ball and chain
Ball and chain

You are the same with your balls and your chains

Bend me over the back of the car seat
Take me down to Easy Street
