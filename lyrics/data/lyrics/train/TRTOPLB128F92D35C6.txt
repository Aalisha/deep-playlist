I feel the earth move
Under my feet.
I feel the sky tumblin' down.
I feel my heart start
To tremblin' whenever you're around.

Ooh, baby, when I see your face,
Mellow as the month of may,
Oh, darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way.

Hey, I feel the earth move
Under my feet.
I feel the sky tumblin' down.
I feel my heart start to tremble
