Clowns caress you
Figures undress your fear
Induced to crime beyond emotion
Shedding tears as big as the ocean

Don't say you didn't hear us callin'
Ooh, ooh, you'll be sorry in the mornin'
When we tell you
Mama had tears in her eyes
She's the only one who never cries

That's the way we destroy a baby
Shut it out, shut it out
That's the way we destroy a baby
Shut it out of your mind
That's the way, that's the way
...
