Hearts of stone, skull and crossbones
We band together
The sound of steel, a noise you can feel
The smell of leather

Suspendered thighs, blackened cat eyes
We love to shout
The power's in the crowd
Cause we all, we all, love it loud
The power's in the crowd - we love it loud

We all need - american metal
