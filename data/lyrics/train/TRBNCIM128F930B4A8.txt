Lonely thoughts from a lonely mind
He fights for recognition
Desperate tries only
Increasing the pressure
Falls blind unseen forever
The children of today
The children of tomorrow
Forced out of a life of their own
We are the sinners of these days
And only bringers of sorrow
We're only bringers of sorrow

Unforgivable sin
