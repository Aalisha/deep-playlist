Verse 1:
Jesus keep me near the cross,
there's a precious fountain;
free to all a healing stream,
flows from Calvary's mountain.

Verse 2:
Near the cross I watch and wait,
hoping and trusting ever;
'til I reach that golden strand,
it's just beyond the river.

Chorus 1:
In the cross,

'til my raptured soul shall find,
one of these days I will find rest,
rest beyond the river.
