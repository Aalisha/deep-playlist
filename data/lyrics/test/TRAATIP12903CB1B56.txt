High on the bell tower
I took my view
Over the downtowns
On the avenues

Where the streets are wide
And the people thrive
And it's further to fall down
'Cause you fly so high

I've never seen such beauty
I've never seen such clear skies
I've never seen such high hopes
I've never seen such tired eyes

And I wish that I could be
Everything you are
Everything you are

Down in the delta
The city wakes
...
