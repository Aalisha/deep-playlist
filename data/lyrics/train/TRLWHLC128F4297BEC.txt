I feel it closing out
The tunnels getting smaller and I'm blacking out
I'm spinning in a capsule world high out in space
I can see you down there
You're as small as hell if it exists
But I don't care
I'm just floating out here

I'm coming in
I'm burning up
I'm feeling fine I can't get enough
I'm flaking out
I'm never giving in
My head is spinning
My head is spinning
