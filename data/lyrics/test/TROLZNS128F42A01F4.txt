(Laura)
He said he loved me
He said he needs me
He said to Keeley he thinks I'm special
He didn't love me
He didn't need me
Got off with Keeley, she thinks shes special


(Reverend)
She used to go out
She used to get dressed up
An all the while
Shes getting more messed up
And she looks out
Through the window pane
As all her friends
Are going out again

She used to smile
She used to go to bars
Now its just rattles
And baby food in jars
Know how shes feeling
Because there ain't no texts
I know she's reeling
They're at the multiplex
