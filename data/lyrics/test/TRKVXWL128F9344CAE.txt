Oh, how I wish that you were here with me,
To listen to the stupid song I sing
Adjectives and nouns for all to hear,
Form an oxymoron to your ear.

For every comma and every quote,
Of every word of every sentence that I wrote,

From my mouth do these words spew,
Every single syllable for you,
As I string the words together, I
Used to see you should be with me tonight.
