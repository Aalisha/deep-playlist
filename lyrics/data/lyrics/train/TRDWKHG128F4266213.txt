Give Me One More Shot: Alabama

Life ain't all that easy I can testify to that
It's been up and down and round and round to get to where I'm at
If you could see how I'm living in this old car I drive
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even wanna stay alive

Chorus:

So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got
