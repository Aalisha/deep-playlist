He's got the green timbs with the fat laces
Yo, yeah, checkin' in, nigga
You say why I call you nigga, think about it
You went from what
From an African, straight to a nigger, you know what I'm saying

We traveling over to what, to what
Negro and then we went to what
Then we went to black
And then it like was on some Afro-American stuff
Afro-Canadian what have you, but guess what

Don't matter what you call yourself
It's what they call you behind your back
Nigga, straight up
Straight up and down, you know what I'm sayin'

A yo, walkin' through the uptown, a black man
(Nigga)
A yo, walkin' down Yonge St., a black man
(Nigga)
A yo, walkin' through Flatbush, a black man
(Nigga)
When the revolution comes I got a finger on the trigga

I was born a regular man of the Earth
With a curse to walk like a soldier since birth
My exterior is shaded in by my melanin
Stereotype of my type is a felon

My people cause static
'Cause automatically now a days we fire automatics
Grammatically adequate my people come equipped
With enough lyrics to move battleships
Blood brother ever since the slave ships

It doesn't matter who I am when I walk by
