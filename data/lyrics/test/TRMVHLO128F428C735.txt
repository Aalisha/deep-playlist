You've got magic inside your finger tips
It's leaking out all over my skin, yeah
Every time that I get close to you
You're makin' me weak with the way you look through those eyes
But all I see is your face

All I need is your touch
Wake me up with your lips
Come at me from up above, yeah, oh, I need you
I remember the way that you move
You're dancin' easily through my dreams
