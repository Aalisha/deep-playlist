Down where this ugly man seeks his sustenance
Down in the blue, midnight flare
A glass hand cuts through the water
Scything into his twisted roots

Then from his eyes spring fireflies
Breathing life into a roaring disguise
Needles and sins, sins and needles
He's gasping for air in the wishing well

Dust to rust, ashes on gashes
Hand around the killing jar
...
