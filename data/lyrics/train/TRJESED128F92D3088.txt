Yeah, I talked out with a friend of mine
Looks like I'm gonna lose your love this time
She says I cheated on you for too long
And don't I realise I ain't that strong
But now the night are so cold and I'm lonely
Lost without all your love
I come crashing down, down, down
Crashing down, down, down
Crashing down, down, down
Like a stone to the ground
Yeah, I come crashing down, down, down
Crashing down, down, down
Now your love ain't around
Yeah, I ain't a child with tears to hide
