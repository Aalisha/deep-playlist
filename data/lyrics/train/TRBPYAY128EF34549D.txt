I know the only way
You said it's not me
I know the only way
You said it can't be
I thought I knew the way
I thought I knew the way

To find a way
The only way it's me
You rise and lost unusual way, you'll see
To find a way
The only thing to me
It's gonna hurt
And by the way it's me

I know the only way
You said it's not me
