Come along, come along,
There's a party tonight.
Have a laugh, sing a song,
Ain't no critic in sight.
Any time of the day,
Yeah it's always alright.
You can bring anyone,
It's an open invite.
If the world's got you down
And you're dealing with pain,
And the pressures of life
Take it's toll on your brain.
Come on into the light,
Come on out of the rain,
If you're looking for something
Where nothing's the same.
