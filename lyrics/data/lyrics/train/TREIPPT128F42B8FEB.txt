Here I am again
Still trying to understand
What you did to me
How can it be
You always disagree

Here I go again
Don't know where this will end
I've seen enough before
I want to be sure
Don't need the hurt no more

Chorus:

See I got to make it
Got to make it through
See I got to make it
Got to make it through
I know what to do
You're always untrue
I got to make it through

Here I stand again
