I had a talk with my woman late last night
And she reassured me everything was alright
And time hung still like a falling rain
Now I know at last that my love is safe
Ah but when I go away my love I leave
Lord I'm but half a man without her by my side
She's this memory that I hold all around
She's this dream that I always hold to believe

I wanna go upon a mountain
