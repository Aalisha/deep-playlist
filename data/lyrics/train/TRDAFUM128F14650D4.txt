Somebody (Somebody like you)

I love the way you groove tonight
I love the way the music's right
There's something in the air tonight
Makes me lose my mind

Don't let the night drift away
Its playing on my mind
Don't let it fade away
Into the lights

Chorus
Somebody like you, somebody like me
You know what to do, cos we've got the key
Life's what you make it so go head and take it right now

Somebody like you, somebody like me
Should never hold back, in what we believe
