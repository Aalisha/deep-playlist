Oh no, where are my hands
They're in my pockets
Away from your hands
And that is where they will stay
Because you are far away
You said you had something to say
But while you were talking, my feet started walking away

Before I knew where I was
I was up short of the motorway
And I kept on walking
And the rain was beating down on my head
And I kept on walking
