Ooh baby, yeah

You can fadeaway, yeah, my love, I will always
Remember your faces, thru fadeaway, sing in

Bless all of your eyes, I realize you're my reason
And I'll cherish the days when our souls will be together

She's my sunshine, she's my moonshine
She's my hot, hot, [Incomprehensible]
She's my lady from Euphrates, devil mother
