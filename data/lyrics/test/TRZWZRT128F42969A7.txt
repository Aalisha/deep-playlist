Every time I'm walkin' down the streets
Some pretty mama stop breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
Ooh, it'll make you lose your mind

I can't walk the streets now, can't consulate my mind
Some no good woman she starts breakin' down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby
