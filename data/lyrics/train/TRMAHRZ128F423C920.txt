Battles burn the wrath of hell
The force cannot be slain
Men and steel we stand as one
To fight on through the pain
Soldiers die the blood runs red
We bear the blackest hates
Metal force now crack the sky
And raise the seven gates

Battle cries the power racks they roar
Blood and death upon the stage of war
Running wild shellshock cracks the beams
Sweat and leather thrashing metal screams
The metal forces!

Haunting mist engulfs the stage
...
