Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get... Gotta get up!
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down

Oh, Oh, baby, baby
Oh, Oh, baby, baby
Oh, Oh, baby, baby
Oh, Oh, baby, baby

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Well, baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even want to waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh... yeah, yeah

Oh, Oh, baby, baby
...
