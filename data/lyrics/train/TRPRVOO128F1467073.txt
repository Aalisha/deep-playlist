Like down in? man oh man
Things be getting stupid
Took everything
Smoked it, looped it
Hundred people speaking
At a hundred miles an hour
At the room at the top
We nearly jumped to the tower
Scenes changing
Nanosecond after nano
We were in a time machine playing the piano
Colors pouring from our heads into the atmosphere
They were going everywhere
Getting there without a care
I swear we weren't enjoying it
See it was out of control man
We were destroying it
I swear we weren't enjoying it
See it was out of control man
We were destroying it
We'll end this demolition with precision
With no more collision
This time we be on our own mission
See we the man
Yeah, got rid of the other kids
And just about only we can live the way we live
We'll take you to the max
Plus a tax and jacks(?)
I'll be back with an? means you can laugh

Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own
(Halleluyah)

Flicking out my blue tounge and catchin' flies
See i was mesmorized by the alphabet
A surprise
So many stories
So enticing
It's like i got out my scizzors
cut em out like?
We got out my scizzors
