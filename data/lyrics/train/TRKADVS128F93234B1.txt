I tell you what we´re gonna do
What you need to know
What you gotta get
To get where you´re wanna go

Never ever missing out
If you run all this place
When you find your style
Everyday´s a holiday

I show you how to work it
(I show you how to work it)
To find nothing is perfect
(To find nothing is perfect)
I know that you deserve it
(I know that you deserve it)

Woho
Woho
Woho
Oh

This is the good life
Take a good look
Have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends
At a fancy restaurant
Living the good life
We have such a good time
Right now

Grab a little gucci bag
And some prada shoes
(Here)
Take my credit card
They're all here to wait on you

Jimmi shoe calls up your name
Seeing you on every wall
When you can´t decide
That´s ok just buy the mall
