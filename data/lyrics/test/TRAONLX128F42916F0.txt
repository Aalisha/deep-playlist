I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free
(So they say)
But it sure is hard to do
Yeah, it sure is hard to do

And I know they say if they don't come back again
Then it's meant to be
(So they say)
But those words ain't pulling me through
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill
Climbin' up a hill

This is the long goodbye, somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
