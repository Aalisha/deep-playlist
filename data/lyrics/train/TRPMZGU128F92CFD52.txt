Take this pain I'm insane
Give all I can to melt away
The words you said split my spine
My mind is raging all the time
One lust burning in the night
Your flesh for me delight
From this day you'll melt away
Did all you could but you'll still pay
I can feel is rising up in me
To take you and do with you what I please
I never lose, always have my way
I will win with you as my prey
