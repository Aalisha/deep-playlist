Holy Moses met the Pharoah
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye
"Let my people go!"...

Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
Yeah, he's just gonna break 'em in half!

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin' in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you
