You know my ringtone (why don't you answer the phone)
If you don't get here (I'm dancing alone)
Get in the fast lane 'cause someone will ask me
If you don't
I hear the music (I'm ready to go)
You better get here ('cause I'm dancing alone)
You better get driving and turn on the siren
Cause you're in the danger zone

You know it's friday
Why don't you call me
You got my number
Hey I'm still waiting
Why don't you call me
Aren't you my boyfriend?
You were supposed to be here
Like an hour ago

I bought this dress for you
I got my legs so smooth
I got my manny paddy went and hot my hair done too
All dressed up and nowhere to go-oh

It's an emergency
I need you here with me
