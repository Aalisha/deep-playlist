(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) Eden
(Na na nanana nana, na na nanana nana na) yeah
Too far gone to turn around, as I make it into town
I said driver, take my suitcase, where's that good time goin' down
Hit the freeway to the skyline, need some faster ecstasy
If she's got a prize, then I've got the money
She said for you the first one's free
And I thought I saw Jesus in the hotel room
As we made love on the balcony
With a drink in my hand, like they said it would be, yeah
So this is Eden, so this is Eden
