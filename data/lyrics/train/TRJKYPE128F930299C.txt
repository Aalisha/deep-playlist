Boy meets girl
You were my dream, my world
But i was blind
You cheated on me from behind
So on my own
I feel so all alone
Though i know it's true
I'm still in love with you

I need a miracle
I wanna be your girl
Give me a chance to see
That you are made for me
I need a miracle
Please let me be your girl
One day you'll see it can happen to me
I need a miracle
