I'd like to take you home and make you happy for the rest of your life, I tell
I'd like to take you home so we both can live as man and wife
And if you'd think for a minute of life with me in it
That would really be fine
I'll tell you right now, that's how it's gotta be.

I'd like to take you home so we can raise a little family, I tell
A boy for you and maybe have a girl or two for me
