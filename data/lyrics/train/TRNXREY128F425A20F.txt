I see you floatin' it constantly
You're making me feel like you
And I could be real, yeah

But then you're flippin' the game
You walk away you turn your back
Baby stop treading on me, baby

'Cause I'm mystified, yeah
And you know I've tried babe
I just can't get through to you, tell me

What you gonna do?
I don't know
What you gonna say?
I ain't sure

Always the same
All the time
Every day
Played my mind

I can't keep wasting my time
On your game

Ain't no doubt about it
Ain't no doubt about it
Ain't no doubt about it
Ain't no, no, no

I've taken all that I can
I've given to you my all
But you don't seem to respond, baby

Oh I can't stand all this waiting
...
