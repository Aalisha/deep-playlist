Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.

And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.
