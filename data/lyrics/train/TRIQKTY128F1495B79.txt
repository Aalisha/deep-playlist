I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are

I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be

Ooh, can it be I stayed away too long?
Oh, did I leave your mind when I was gone
Now, it's not my thing trying to get back
Ooh, this time let me tell you where I'm at

You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
Now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
