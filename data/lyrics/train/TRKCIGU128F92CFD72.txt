Stay, forever who you are
Don't change a thing
Because you are perfect

You sway, gently in the breeze
In between my dreams
It kinda makes me nervous

You're storm, is lightning striking down
To only strike me once
Would still be worth it

[CHORUS:]
In my dreams, you were perfect
When I woke up, you were perfect

Love, as scaring as it is
Tell me, is it real?
If it aint hurting

I break, when sounding of you fades
...
