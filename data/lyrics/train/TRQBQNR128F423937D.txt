morning light interrupt my dreams
on the verge of something i dont want to see
broken light interrupt my dreams
turning into someone i don't want to be
i know that today's just like any other day
but everything's changed

i put my feet on the ground
i hope i'm leaving for the last time now

i must admit i've sinned a bit
i must admit i saw no end to all of it
my eyes pulled wide, time is on my side
this cloud of mine, the weight is gone, gone, gone
