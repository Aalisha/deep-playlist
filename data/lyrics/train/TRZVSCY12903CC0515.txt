Cast your mind back ten years
To the girl who's next to me in school
If I put my hand upon her leg
She'd hit me with a rule

Though tomorrow won't be long
You're gonna have to play it cool
You've been fascinated by her
She could set the place on fire

Run and get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
See the buildings start to really burn
(Ooh) Get the fire brigade
Get the fire brigade
If you jump, you've got to wait your turn

Friends all seem to laugh
