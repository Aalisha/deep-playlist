It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"

Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iiii?)
(I don't seem obvious do I?)

The DJ never has it
J A M C, automatic
(do Iiii?)
If those were Roy's headphones
You bet he'd play "What Goes On"
(do Iiii?)
