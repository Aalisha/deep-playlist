Tryin¡�¯ to figure out just where you are
You tried to play the game of love, didn¡�¯t get too far
You told yourself you¡�¯d be nobody¡�¯s fool
You want a good reason why love is so cruel, baby

Oh, oh, round and round
Love¡�¯s got you goin¡�¯
It¡�¯s turnin¡�¯ you upside down
You play the game, it¡�¯s so insane
Like lost and found
Love¡�¯s got you spinnin¡�¯ all around, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Are you thinkin¡�¯ love has passed you by, oh
Do you feel so alone, sometimes you just sit and cry
Tryin¡�¯ to think if love was meant for you
Oh, you¡�¯re startin¡�¯ to wonder what you¡�¯re gonna do, baby

Oh, oh, round and round
Love¡�¯s got you goin¡�¯
It¡�¯s turnin¡�¯ you upside down
You play the game, it¡�¯s so insane
Like lost and found
Love¡�¯s got you spinnin¡�¯ all around, baby
