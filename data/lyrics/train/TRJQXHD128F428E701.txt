I hope this old train breaks down
then I could take a walk around
and, see what there is to see
time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
walking as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my windows got a view
Well the frame im looking through
seems to have no concern for me now
so for now I

I need this
old train to breakdown
oh please just
let me please breakdown

Well this engine screams out loud
Saying this beat gonna crawl westbound
so I dont even make a sound
Because its gunna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
that i'll never get to meet
...
