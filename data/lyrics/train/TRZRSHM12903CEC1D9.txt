i watch the way you move,
and i count by the way you press your eyes
and by the little things that put you down,
ride the rails to where you are - help me thank you all,
let me fuck you all, and by the way you bitch and masturbate,
the bold ones carry on and on the way your prayer come up
and have fun - the way to carry on

i'm a dog, i know, i'm a dog

it's the only way, it's the corner stay
...
