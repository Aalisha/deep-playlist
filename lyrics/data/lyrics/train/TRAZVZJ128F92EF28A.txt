December 26th, '04.
Dan's dad dropping of the van for the Make Move Tour.
We're meeting up soon with The Warriors.
We're losing money and our lunches on the jeans Matt wore
To the first show. We're on the road.

May 22nd, '06.
Zoli just tried to ignite a Roman candle stick.
We're troubling the stateside with CIS.
A full blown assault on the whole U.S.
Take on the world, and see it all.

Even as we get older
We can do it all over.
Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives.
Looking into the future,
There is more room to move here.
Invincible as we score the music to our own lives.
