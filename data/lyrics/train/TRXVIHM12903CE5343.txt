Back to Hell!

Resurrected from the dead
Vengeance keeps on driving him
You take a bullet in the head
Cut you up, limb by limb
He was betrayed by the force
Behind bars among the thieves
Smashing down the prison doors
Badge of evil never sleeps

He will hunt till Armageddon
Won't stop before the deed is done
Coming for you, coming for me
Time to set the sinners free

In the night, in the moonlight
From the shadows he will avenge
In the night, in the moonlight
...
