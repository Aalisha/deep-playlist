It's a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you solve the riddle you can save your soul
Or chase love's shadows till the rivers run cold.

But hey babe
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Woo hoo...

There's a longing in the people
No one knows just what the outcome will be
You can flee in terror, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream it's just not right.

But hey baby
