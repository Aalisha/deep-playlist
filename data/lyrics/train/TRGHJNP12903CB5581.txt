Royal Vibes - Ky-Mani Marley

She say
And she say
And she sayyea, yea, yea
She say
And she say
And she say

AND SHE SAY
Shes never been loved like this before
Shes never been touched like this before
Shes never felt feelings like this before
Shes in love with me
Yet she say

Shes never been loved like this before
Shes never been touched like this before
Shes never felt feelings like this before
Shes in love with me
And she say


She love me for the royal vibes wha me bring
She love me for the earthful songs da wha me sing
She say she love me for, inna the bed and we make love she hear the angels dem a sing
Yet she say

She love me for this rasta life Im living
She love me for, she love the way ay love mey king
She say she love me for inna dey moments of mey jah ay burn
She love mey gangsta rhythm
Then I say

Gyal I never bring you no harm
