Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand

Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet

I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to

Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
