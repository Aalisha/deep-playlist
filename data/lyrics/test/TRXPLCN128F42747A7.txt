Your love is like a tidal wave, 
Spinning over my head
Drownin' me in your promises, 
Better left unsaid
You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker, dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around, no, no, no
