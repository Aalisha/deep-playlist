I caught you smiling
I know I've seen you here before
How come you're hiding
Hey don't cha wanna hit the floor?

The place is crowded
Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead
(Dancing in the sheets)

Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
