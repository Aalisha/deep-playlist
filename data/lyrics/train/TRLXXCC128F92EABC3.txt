So wide you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
(So low you can't get under it)
So high you can't get over it
(So high you can't get over it)
Da-yee do do do do do do

This is a chance
This is a chance
To dance your way
Out of your constrictions
(Tell suckah!)
Here's a chance to dance our way
out of our constrictions
Gonna be freakin'
Up and down
Hang-up alley way
With the groove our only guide
We shall all be moved
Ready or not here we come
Gettin' down on
the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
gettin' down just for the funk
(Can I get it on the good foot)
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
(Good God)
(bout time I got down one time)
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
Ah ah aye aiii aiiieeeeee
