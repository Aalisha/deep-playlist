You're my soul song
My everything that I do song
My pick me up when I'm blue song
That's why I sing all the time
You're my soul song
That's why I call you my solid gold song
Nothing in the world could ever go wrong
As long as you are mine

Never in the world have I seen anybody like you
In all my time
You give me a feel good feelin' through and through
And it's so fine
I'm up with the sun 'cause I don't wanna waste it
