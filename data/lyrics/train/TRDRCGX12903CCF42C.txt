Baby take off your coat real slow
Baby take off your shoes
Yeah I'll take off your shoes
Baby take off your dress, yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Go over there, girl turn on the light, all the lights, baby
Come back here stand up on that chair
Oh girl you know that's right
Now raise your arms in the air, now shake 'em
