You know I really wanna see you when you know I might not
(And you make me want you more when you hurt me a lot)
I say I really love you and you say that you don't
(And it really turns me on when you say that you won't)

CHORUS
The blues before and after
I get the blues before and after I'm with you
The blues before and after
I get the blues before and after loving you
...
