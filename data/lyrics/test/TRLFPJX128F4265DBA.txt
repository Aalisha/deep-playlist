For his age, he's wise, he's got his mother's eyes
There's gladness in his heart
He's young and he's wild, my only prayer is if I can't be there

Lord, oh Lord, protect my child

As his youth now unfolds, he is centuries old
Just to see him at play, oh, it makes me smile
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny

Lord, oh Lord, protect my child
