Woke up this morning without a face.
I've fooled myself again.
I've sold myself again.
Another wasted day counting shades of gray.
Another fool's attempt to fall from grace.

A casual line.
A sip of wine to sympathize
While you're laughing.
But on the inside
I've lost the insight that just might be the truth...

Old man loneliness is a son of a bitch!
Both hands bound, can't scratch the itch!
CUT OFF ALL LOOSE TIES, and bleed for days!
Who could stand veins with friends like these?

I pick my teeth out of the mud,
And sink the sun.
"What have you done?"
I cut the bandages,
Remove the oxygen.
"Hey man, what's with that stupid grin?"

I cut and bleed myself along.
