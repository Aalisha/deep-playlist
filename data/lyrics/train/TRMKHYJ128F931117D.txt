They swallowed it whole, they went for the gold for the gold
We fall for the same lies, we all have the same shoes to fill

The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone
Some day they will be forgotten and die one by one

The walls, the walls are coming down, 
the here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships, the ships are coming in,
