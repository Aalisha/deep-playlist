To walk amongst the dead
plauged by an undeniable thirst for blood.
Stained by an immortal suffering given to you.

Acceptance from your kind
is only a temporal solution to your misery.
Transcending time haunts your very existence visions
of events are forever imbedded in your mind.

For you are never allowed to sleep eternally.
Countless prey have satisfied your hunger.
Intoxicated with the essence of life
blood tastes so sweet
