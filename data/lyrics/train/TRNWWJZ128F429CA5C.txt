Raine

When I hold you in my arms, I can feel you breathe
When I look into your eyes, makes me believe
In a God, in a place, that brings me hope, gives me faith
Before our time is done, I want to be the one to

Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my Raine

If I ever let you down, I didn't mean to do that
If you need me and I'm not around, I am sorry for that
