He was sittin' at the bar
Sippin' on a regular Coke
We were drinkin' and smokin'
And makin' him the butt of our jokes

We all said,? Man, what happened to you?
Why can't you just have a few?
He said,? I would if I could
But it's probably best that I don't?

'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Then I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud and it gets worse
