At five o'clock she knows I'll soon be home
And she don't worry 'bout me runnin' round
'Cause all of my good times are waitin' right there for me
And she knows where I'll be when the sun goes down

I'm a stand by my woman man
Our world turns around a little gold band
And love leads us through life, hand in hand

I'm a stand by my woman man
