Baby, you know I love you
But you know right now
You know it's just getting to be too much
Ooh yeah, I really don't wanna go

Listen, it was back in '99, I was a real nigga
Took you and your shorty in just to deal witcha
In the beginning, it was rough
'Cause sumtin' was missing that he love
He's always acting up, baby, I've had enough

Don't need no child support 'cause I provided
Bought him anything he wanted you can't deny it
I've always treated him right, he's coming between our love
And what y'all got I can't mess up

Maybe in another life
We can be together
Promise that next time won't leave you ever

Maybe in another life
The sun will shine forever
With you in my life, no more stormy weather

And maybe in another life, yeah
We can be together
Promise that next time won't leave you ever

Maybe in another life
The sun will shine forever
With you in my life, no more stormy weather

I got to walk away, look at the big picture
