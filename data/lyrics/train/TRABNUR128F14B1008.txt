I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars

Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired

Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye

My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?

Now I'm unwhole

You waged your war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you please just give us...
