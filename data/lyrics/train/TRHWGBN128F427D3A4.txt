It's a pointless, small place on a map in outer space.
Every second, everyday you're gone.
I've got a job that I can't keep working on.
Yeah.

I think you are so annoying,
That's why you get so disappointing.
I swear you are so important.
Nothing you do is pointless.
Yeah.

There is no modern mystery,
No mystic chords of memory.
There is no modern mystery,
We're making up our history.

Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah.
Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah.
