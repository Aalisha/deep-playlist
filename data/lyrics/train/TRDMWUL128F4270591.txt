Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face
Don't mind people grinnin' in your face
You just bear this in mind, a true friend is hard to find
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face

You know your mother would talk about you
Your own sisters and your brothers too
They just don't care how you're tryin' to live
They'll talk about you still
