Is it really true what they're saying
Are you really sure there's nobody come for me
When I'm walking home there is no-one
Once there was a house, full of laughter - so warm
Trying to pretend there is someone
Someone who will care when I need it

I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine
Just a drink to take my sorrow
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow
