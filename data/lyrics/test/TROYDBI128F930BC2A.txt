The rainy days have come again
Feel like breakin' down
Feel like breakin' down
Memories of long lost friends
Come and flood my head
All the things we said
Swords and knives and fork and spoons
For the killing feast
Alive or deceased
Spinning round and round my room
Feel like breakin' down
Feel like slowin' down

Come now hold my hand
Walk with me
Talk with me
Life's all good
When I'm alone with you
If I had just one wish
Life remains just the same
Don't change a thing for me
All I can be
...
