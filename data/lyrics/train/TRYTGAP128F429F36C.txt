(Intro)
Uh, from the top Cigar
Odds & Evens, this is for you
Pick any number, it's for you
Cause I beat the odds
And I'm gettin' even
Yeah, I hope you enjoyin' this album
Yeah, I hope you doin' what you do best
And I hope you bangin' your motherfuckin' head right now

(Defari)
Roll yours windows up
Take a ride in a 65 degree Q4-5
Blowin' green stuff, bumpin' mean stuff
Mindin' my own, these squares don't mean much
I'm on Adams, I want some J & J's
Home fries, turkey, sausage, grits, and eggs
A lemonade, now I'm good for the day
Got rehearsal at 12: 00, gotta bring top shelf
So, you know I'm faded when I'm at work
You've been to the shows, that's my best work
Alkaholik pro's - network
Los veteranos, experts
This style's crazy, make your chest hurt
Weak hearts feel a spark from the pepper
I spit like a man that you've never heard
So if you hear this style again, must be a mockingbird
