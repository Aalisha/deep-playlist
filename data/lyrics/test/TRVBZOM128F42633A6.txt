You tell me that you're ready but you just don't know
My eyes are getting heavy and it's starting to show
I'd never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through whatever it's coming to me

â€˜Cause I've been so unlucky I don't know what to say
I'm running out of money, I've been wasting away
I'd never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I'll get through whatever it's coming to me

We fall (We fall down)
If you fall (We fall down)
If you fall down hard I'll be ready to crawl

And

I'm ready
...
