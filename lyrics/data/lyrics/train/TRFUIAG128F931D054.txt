It was on a wedding day
When my heart began to stray
Never thought I'd make such a big mistake
Throw my life away

I've gone days without food
I've went weeks without sleep
I've got cuts I can't close
I've got wounds that won't heal
It's all your fault


My hand's covered in blood
Scars on my skin
I forgot how to feel
My skin is paper thin

We've been through this
Feeling it, keeping it, holdin' it and
We've gone through this
Over and over again
...
