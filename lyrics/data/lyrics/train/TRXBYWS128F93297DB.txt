Contessa, Contessa, oh please leave your hat by the door
Well, I thought I told you, you couldn’t call round anymore
And outside in the street and the rains turning tricks on the day
Contessa, I’ve told you so why do you come anyway?

Well, ten years ago by the motorway bridge with a smile
And your red lacquer shoes, oh you lived inside me for a while
I had an old cow bone that I used to draw hearts in the dust
Oh, Contessa please tell me just what the hell happened to us

‘Cause I’ve gone
Gone, run that road
I’ve gone
Gone, run that road
...
