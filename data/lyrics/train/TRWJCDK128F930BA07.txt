Wassup baby?
this is a night that you'll never forget
of all the things that you desire
I got it right here baby
guess what?
I'm back
I'm back

baby the mood is right and the stars are out tonight
I cant wait til you get home
I got some rose petals leading to the bedroom door
where I'm waiting all alone
with candles lit glass of perignon
wanna make u lose control
girl I'm telling you tonight is yours
all I wanna know is

Do you wanna love me?
Gonna give you reason so you can love me forever babe
I wanna make love babe
Make your temperature rise until you say its too hot babe
Do you wanna feel me?
