This is a song about love
The joy of having it
And the agony of being without it

I've heard it said
That all is fair in love and war
And I can see why
Because when the heart gives a command
The mind, soul and body must obey

This is about a young girl
That got hung up on a married man
In all her life she had been taught
That this is wrong

She tried to shake it loose
But it didn't work
She was in too deep

And soon neighbors began whispering
And that's when her conscience went to work
It got the the point she would walk the floor at night
Searching for a solution

And one of those nights
She remembered she heard somewhere
That open confession is good for the soul
So she went to her mother and confessed
That she was hung up on a married man
