Did I tell you that I love you
Did I tell you what you mean to me
Did I tell you how think of you when I think about eternity, oh my
Did I tell you that I wanna stay in your arms and never turn away
Did I tell you that I love you
Well I want you to know that I do, I do

All that you do for me, I could never once repay
Yet and still you turn around and you do it anyway
I'm always begging, pleading, asking
But now I'm falling on my knees before you saying

Did I tell you that I love you
Did I tell you what you mean to me
Did I tell you how think of you when I think about eternity, oh my
Did I tell you that I wanna stay in your arms and never turn away
Did I tell you that I love you
Well I want you to know that I do, I do

All the time you're blessing me
Yet and still I ask for more
Instead of saying thanks for all the things you've done before
