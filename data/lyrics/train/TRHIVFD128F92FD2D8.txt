Time to play - to cut off your head
Time to die - my cruelty will make you dead
Show your fear, don't escape into madness
Your rotting gutted body
Shall vanish in the maze of Death

An ablazing usurper's dream
Blasphemy to idols made in stone
Throne of might and its unseen Lord
Stars waned by the fright of Him

Shining jewels in his crown
like drops of my sacrificial blood
...
