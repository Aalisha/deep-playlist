(elements...)

As your body is relieved on your spirit
Which has returned to pure energy
You'll become a part. of the elements

[chorus:]
Feel this fire deep inside
Burning strong where you can't hide
Join the elements tonight
And see the light,
When the darkness comes too strong
Don't forget your not alone
Join the elements tonight
