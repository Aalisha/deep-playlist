I can't stop shakin'
The room has a groove and the floor
It's almost earthquakin'
Uhuh

Look what we're makin'
History out on the floor
And it's just awakin'
Uhuh

So get that needle in the core
Scratch that back and gimme more
You know zactly what I came here for
Back it up and do it again

From the middle to the top to the end
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Ba dlu dla dlun dloday
Back to the middle to the front to the end
Za dlu dla dlun dloday
Everybody ba dlun dloday
I don't care if he's a friend
...
