Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Three little children layin' in the bed
Two were sick and the other 'most dead
Sent for the doctor, the doctor said
"Feed those children on shortnin' bread"
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin'
Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread
When those children layin' in the bed
Heard that talk about shortnin' bread
They popped up well and started to sing
