In this life there is no truth
When you search for middle ground
You willfind no absoloutes

In your search for black and white
You'll find that things fall to the shadows

But for this ain't enough
You just have to keep on pushing
Man your life will be real tough

Seen through my eyes

Idealism clings to you
You know the answers out there
