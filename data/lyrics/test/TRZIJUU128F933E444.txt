This is how we try to keep warm
And trust me you'll need it when it's cold
One more thing just so you don't forget
Don't wake him when he's sleeping
Try and hide before he sees you
You can try but I'm that you won't
Don't you cry so that he hears you
I am sure that you won't

And you'll despise yourself for dreaming
Hate yourself for believing
Lie to yourself in obedience
