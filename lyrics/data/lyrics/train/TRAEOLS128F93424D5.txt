You better get a lawyer

When you said that it was time
To change your point of view
Never entered in my mind
That what you meant was
we were through
Jumpin' to conclusions
Is really not my style
And if it's just illusion
It'll vanish in a while
Perhaps the pain and stingin'
Is only in my mind
I can change my thinkin'
But my heart is cryin' ouch

CHORUS:

High Crime
(What you doin' to me)
That you don't love me
...
