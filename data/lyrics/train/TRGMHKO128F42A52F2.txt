Strong, strong as a mountain
One you can count on
That's how my love is for you
Sure as forever, we'll be together

'Til the sky's no longer blue
I know it won't always be easy
When we need to be strong
Baby, believe me

I'll do whatever it takes
To hold on to your love
Swim every ocean
If that's not enough

Walk to the ends of the earth
