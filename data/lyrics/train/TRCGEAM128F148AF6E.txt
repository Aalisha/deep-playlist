I'm gonna lay this body down
cover me with snow
chill my burning flesh, it's scolding
decency and pride

Cold war is over
opening my pores
the flame each pore is breathing in
is coming from my core

Sweet and gentle sleepiness
coming from the cold
Come back faithful punishment
cover me with snow
...
