So take one what you said
You put it in your bed
You rest your tiny head on your pillow
You wonder where you're going next
You've got your head pushed to my chest
And now you're hoping that someone lets you in
Well I swear I'll let you in
You know I'll let you in
Oh Kelsey
You

So don't let anyone scare you
You know that I'll protect you
Always
Now through the thick and thin
Until the end
You better watch it
You know you don't cross it
Because I'm always here for you
And I'll be here for you
(I know I know I know)
I know how it feels
Believe me; I've been there
And (I know I know I know)
