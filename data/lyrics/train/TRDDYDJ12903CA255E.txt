What's happenin? Let's drop this shit off for the homie from Long Beach
Let's say Compton and the L-B-C meet the East and West again
Motherfuckin Half Dead in this bitch
My nigga Tray in this bitch
They call me the hurricane Chill, check it out

A little something for the Bloods, Crips, rucks for your ride
G'z and locs from the East and the Westside
Dedicated to the gang related
Buckin' fools down makin the other side run and hide
Throw your straps in the sky one time, buck buck...
Buck, we don't give a fuck
Lay yo ass in a puddle, shit
Quick to bust for my niggas from the East and the West clique

This is dedicated to the East and the Westside
(Yeah, this is dedicated to the East and the Westside baby)
So put your shit in the deck adjust the bass and let the tape ride
(We gon put it in and let it ride baby)
Cuz me and my homie Chill are droppin gangsta shit
(We droppin enough of that gangsta shit)
The type o' shit that none of you bustaz can fuck with
(That's right, where none of you bustaz can fuck with)
So step the fuck back before you smacked all in ya face
(Before you get smacked up)
Cuz when it comes to puttin it down, Half Dead runs the whole place (Yeah)

We chillin on the Eastside
Smokin weed on the Westside
Gettin drunk on the Eastside
Fuckin bitches on the Westside
Gettin jacked on the Eastside
One times on the Westside
