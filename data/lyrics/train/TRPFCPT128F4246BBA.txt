Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh.

Stand on the outside, looking in.
Don't know where to turn, where to begin.
It's a long viney road.
I am on travel in a restless heart.

Where flying so high, touching the sky.
Spreading our wings again.
My heart is up high, with burning desire.
Always I will stand by your side.
Don't give up on love.

No, no.
