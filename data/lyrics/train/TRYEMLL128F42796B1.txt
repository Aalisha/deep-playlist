I followed you to Texas, I followed you to Utah
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
I went with you to Alabama, things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there, so we moved on

I know you're tired of followin'
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
