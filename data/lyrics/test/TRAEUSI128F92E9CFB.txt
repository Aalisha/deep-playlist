The rain in Bombay fall on the righteous and the wrong
And there is no way for me to understand
Faces pull towards me like the sea to the moon
Eyes like diamonds in the sun
Abraham's grains of sand spilling over the streets
A wave of statistics

The rain in Bombay feeds the swelling of the sea
It threatens to drown all the voices drowning me
We stand beneath the gateway of the foreign kings and queens
With nothing but pockets of candy
...
