We're making habits out of vanities and gospel for the stalls
But the less you breathe the more you see of it all

The lions share is courting the teen
One hand holds them back while the other is holding me
We don't connect though we're both disconnected

Oh, oh yeah, we're so in love or else we're waving
The unloaded guns in the air but it's the same thing, ain't it?

I'm only here to give you someone to leave when you get bored
But the first mistake so good it'll only ensure another

Oh, oh yeah, you look so good or you're just saving
