[Tony Yayo:]
Money make the world go round [x3]
New York, money make the world go round
L.A., money make the world go round
Midwest, money make the world go round
Down South, money make the world go round
Southside, money make the world go round

Some people want nothin out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin like a rebel
Ridin with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin alive was no jive
Standin on the strip you get stuck like velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
