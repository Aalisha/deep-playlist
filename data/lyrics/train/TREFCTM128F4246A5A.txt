Look at the world we're living in
War, hate, killing the innocent
Manipulating our brains
We're just victims of the insane
Poisoned live, unholy decadence
Filling the new with your sick ignorance
Sending our children to war
Tell me what are they dying for
Who's playing God

Global conflict, this war will never end
Blame it all on misguided religions
Continue your senseless fight
I see no end in sight
East, west following prophecies
Comes to us by radio and TV
Who's telling the truth
