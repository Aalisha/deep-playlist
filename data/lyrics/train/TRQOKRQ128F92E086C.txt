(Keith, Luccketta, Skeoch)

I'll be lovin' you come morning, day to day, dust to dawn
Feelin' you're the reason I won't be leavin' so
Love you in the evening, supper time and afternoon
Your days of happiness beside the month of June

Ooh, don't want my yesterday, to wake me up, slap me in the face
Ooh, don't let my yesterday, wrap you up and carry you away
Ooh I need your lovin', without you baby love don't mean nothing
Oooh I need your lovin', 's got to be your lovin' or nothing
