I've got a friend inside my head but I can't convince the
Rest of the World [4x]
And the rest of the world can go screw themselves, just like
I will any day. The rest of the world can go screw
themselves, just like I will, just like I will any day.
I know that hate and war are bad but I can't convince the
Rest of the World [4x]
