Here she comes down the street and that look is in her eye
And the way she looks, if looks could kill they might
All the kids down in the street run away
When she goes by, it's the end of the day
So believe what they say, there's danger in the air.

Look through a window and you'll see her standing there
She's the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin' in her hair
The prima donna, she's back in town
And you see her for miles around
So believe what they say, there's danger in the air.

Beware, there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
