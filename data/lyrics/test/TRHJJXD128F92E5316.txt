So I always get nostalgic with that song
But in my room it's forced
It has to be in some car across the street
And I always catch the back of your head in a crowd
Just don't turn around
It's never you and you ruin those memories
And those photos are great if I catch them with the side of my eye
But if I stare, it just turns into you and me
We're just standing there

And now its over
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs
And when you go there
Would you hear me
Scream at the top of my lungs

So I always fool my friends and we head down there
You think that we are en route
