I see a long blood stained corridor in front of my eyes
Walls all ripped and torn of lost souls trying to get out

I want to run escape this
Leave all behind this suffering
Run out of here alone to be
I don't care they're all gone to me

All I feel now is mental disarray
Feeling claustrophobia while running in dismay
I'm not here to stay; running away
Hell awaits but not today

Smashing against the wall while running through this nightmarish hall
In this hell, tearing nails out while clawing the way up again
...
