Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
Sometimes all my days are filled with rain
As I travel down life's highway, things ain't going my way
Cause there's always someone swervin' in the lane

You keep a swervin' in the lane and it's causing' lots of danger
I'm a honkin' on my horn, I'm a shooting you the finger
I keep a switchin' on my bright lights, but you're just too dim to know
When you're swervin' on life's highway, you're running someone off the road
