Research finding pathways in the seamless web
In black spaces between words a field unknown
Repeat endless mantras of the stored collective drone
A surface-world is what the senses show

But you cannot taste the essence of your soul

Sever all strings to the confined
Forget all that has been
Sever all strings to mortal life
Unveil and see through

With every thought you find a sequence has begun
And when you trust the senses, peace of mind will never come
