Gals, He’s a fine fine thang
(Ain’t he fine?)
Lord knows, he sure is fine
(Ain’t he fine?)
Gals, I can’t help myself
(She’s gonna do it)
(She’s gonna do it)

I'm going to do it until the cows come home
And when my goose gets loose
She's gonna know
I'm still be getting it on
With him around, now
(Move it, move it)

I’m gonna move it slow like a mule
(Go on and move it, gal)
I’m gonna love him funky free and foolish
I’m gonna do my best
And try hard to get him

(Ain’t he fine)
Just take a look at that child
