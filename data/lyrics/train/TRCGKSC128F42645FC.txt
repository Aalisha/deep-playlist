Underneath the sky of blue, it's a time of choosing
Everybody's holding on, to what they're losing
But it all works out okay, if you give your life away
To the one who's holding fast, it's a promise that will last

You're caught in a crossfire
Of a greater love than man has ever known
Caught in a crossfire
And you've got to choose which way you're gonna go
Caught in a crossfire
In a world of darkness turn to the light

Time's disappearing, all that you're fearing
Dreamers awaken, chances are taken away

There isn't any in-between, there's no escaping
...
