Mr. Dream Merchant, yeah!
Uh, I know you see me
Yeah, I know you hear me
Sh'yo, I know you fear me
My pen packin a venom, heart pumpin the sound
Ma, I'm pimpin the system, my catalogue is the hound
Got a problem we air 'em, intellegent and I scare 'em
Beat knockin they hear 'em, why in earth did they pair 'em?
Niggas spittin that fiction, addicted to my diction
Wanna know what I'm fixin, try peepin the kitchen
What the game's been missin, not a thing if you ask
Been here for years, you decided to pass
Uh, I'm here wit Pooh in the lab, Khrysis on the boards
Still spittin all the real shit the ladies adore
When he come in the door, all eyes on moi
Frustrated cause they cain't believe we came so far
Butt dick ridin niggas, it's a big faux pas
