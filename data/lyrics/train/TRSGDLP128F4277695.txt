I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than givin' birth
My first verse explains some of the game she was playin'
I'm blamin' myself 'cause in my wealth was her pain would haven

Behavin' like a money hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
From a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'

She got too big for her britches but the bitch is over
Not the one in Queens I mean the one she dreamin' wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fuckin' belt

I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Shoulda drowned ya when I found ya crushin' in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

Come back, come back, come back
Come back to me, Punisher
Punish me, ah, I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back?

Nah baby, I'm not gon' be able to do it, you blew it
Threw it all the way 'cause you was stupid, girl, why'd you do it?
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
