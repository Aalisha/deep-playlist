Well, the sun sets in the west
But as fast as you go
How would you know?
You're a busy boy, I guess

Who just wants the gold
At the end of the road
Think of all you miss
Passing through like this

You want an answer
As soon as you say a prayer
You want to land
The moment you're in the air
Baby, the living is all
