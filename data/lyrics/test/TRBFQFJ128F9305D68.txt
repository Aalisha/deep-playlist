I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff, they put inside.
Stretch Armstrong
I was Roger Stall back in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball-stars
And a couple of Evil Knievel scars.
On my right arm

I was a kid when Elvis died.
And my momma cried.

It was nineteen seventy-somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett hairdo days
Bell bottoms and eight track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me.
Oh man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'.
