Here I lay my humble message for you Lord
As you read through it
As you go through them
As you read those words
Please accept those little happiness that
I could deliver to you
When I realise your.

(pre-)

Unconditional love
Unconditional cares
You gave me your one and only son
Jesus Christ to take away my pain
And He did cleanse me.

Why won't I praise you?
Why won't I adore you?
