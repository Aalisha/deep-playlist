We've been over this a thousand times
Spinnin' our wheels instead of saying goodbye
Down by the water where we first kissed
Goin' under graffiti bridge

It's still brighter than a neon sign
I remember watchin' you paint your name next to mine
We couldn't try no harder so it's come down to this
I can't get over graffiti bridge

I can still see your Thunderbird fly
...
