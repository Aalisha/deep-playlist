I would climb up
An endless mountain for Your love
I would crawl across
The mighty desert for Your love

You set the world in motion
You made the stars and ocean
And everything that breathes
You cause the skies to thunder
You fill the world with wonder
And that amazes me

That You would plan all my days eternally
Long before I was born, You dreamt of me
If it weren't for Your company
Then where would I be

I would climb up
An endless mountain for Your love
I would crawl across
