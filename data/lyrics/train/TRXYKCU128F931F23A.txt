Lie lie lie lie
Young man, you too lie
Yow, you haffi cut it out

(Oh I), I never thought anyone could be
So conniving as you, it seems
You took my heart
Throw it on the playing field
(Ohhh and I)Never thought you could be so cruel
Try fi see what nobody else could
While all the while,
You was a tek mi fuh yuh fool

(Ohhh)
I saw a lonely bird (saw a bird)
But all them things I heard
Has made me realise (has made me realise)

Tell me why you had to lie (Tell me why you lie to me)
Boy you said to me (Tell me why you said to me)
That you would love me till the end of time
Faithfully (Baby Boy, why yuh lie)
And I (And I)
Takin back my heart (Takin it bak boy)
Was a fool to think that we could never part

Why'd you lie (Tell me baby why'd you lie)
Why'd you lie lie lie lie lie
Why'd you lie (Why'd you want to make me cry)
Why'd you lie li lie lie lie lie lie li lie
Why'd you lie (Tell me baby why'd you lie)
Why'd you lie lie lie lie lie li lie
Why did you lie to me baby (Why'd you want to make me cry)

(Oh Oh I)
Somebody callin my house at night
Hang up the phone wen mi guh fi say hi
And wen me ask you, you wah ask lie (wah ask lie boy)
(Oh and I)
When me deh down at the laundromat
