Feast or fuckin' Famine. Lost Cauze.
Juju Mob. Eyego D. Holla at ya boy! Holla at ya boy!

Yo
The Lost Cauze is about venom
Seein' me is a wild vision
You grown man with child wisdom, I'll kill 'em
My rhymes wildin' the fuck out, y'all chillin'
You'se a small villain
Yo, pray for y'all children
Hail the all wicked
My dick look like a bald midget
And that's something that I'm proud of
My team's strong cause guns equal power
You'se a god damn coward
Your heart skip when the Cauze rip
Been nice since Kane came with the chains and the "aww shit"
You don't remember that
Cause you'se a hip hop toddler suckin' on Similac
Now give it back
Or I'm snatchin'
I costarred in The Passion as an assassin
But they cut it at the last second
You who nicer than Reef?
No suburban nerd rapper, no guy in the street
Take your face and beat you with it
I take a nap while you rap
Wake up, make a snack, come back and eat you wit it motherfuckers
