I've got to hold that girl, even though she doesn't know
Frustration touches everything, one word is all she needs to win

(Pretty soon) she's gonna find out why
(Pretty soon) she's gonna find out
Something's gonna make her mine
Something's gonna make her mine
Something's gonna make her mine (she'll find out why)
Something's gonna make her mine

Nothing could ever make me say what it is to feel this way
A possession of a different kind, I could keep her by my side
