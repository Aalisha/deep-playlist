Welcome to the dark side of the 20th century
The world has gone crazy
Tells you tales and show you things you hardly won't believe
Though you gotta face it

I'm watching the screen

Walking back in history
The wise men prophesied
That hard times were dawning
Read into their tarots
For the future of mankind
