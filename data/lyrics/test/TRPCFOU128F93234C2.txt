Never thought it'll be this way
All I really want is to play
First for me,
It's just a game.
But now, nothing's the same

Boy you make me shout, (ooh baby)
Eat my heart out.

From this time it's true
I wanna say 'I LOVE YOU'
Hands up! I surrender!
Please accept this offer,
If you stay with me forever.
Then it's gonna be,
it's gonna be.
GAME OVER.

You may think I'm going crazy
I want you so desperately
And to tell you the real score
...
