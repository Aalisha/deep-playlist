You haven't drawn a breath
But I know you
Still unformed, and yet
The flame burns true

And I can't stop what's already begun
Where can I go when nowhere else exists to run

You haven't scarred me yet
But I feel you
Not yet manifest
But the pain burns true

And I can't hide from what's about to come
Inevitably everything will be undone
...
