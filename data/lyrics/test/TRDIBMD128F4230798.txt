We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the sea
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
...
