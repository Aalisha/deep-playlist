Killing you
Might be the only chance I have
Of recovery
But I know it's so severe
As you know it would be
The punishment, it fits the crime.

So let's take this knife (Take this knife)
And run it down your chest
Does this feel like love? (Feel like love)
Here we are waiting
So let's take this knife
And run it down your chest
Does this feel like love?
Here we are waiting

The light looks good against
The bruises on your cheek
Another medal that you'll have to wear this week
...
