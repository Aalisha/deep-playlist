Jack was nimble
Jack, he was quick
Jack could jump right over the candle stick

Now he's gone and I'm burning
All alone
Yeah he's gone and I'm burning still, oh no

A beautiful story left incomplete
Ooh, how he knocked me off my feet

Sitting by my window pane
Thinking am I going insane
Why do you only shoot me halfway to the moon

And I can't get over that, over that
