I GO CRAZY
Paul Davis
Hello girl it's been awhile
Guess you'll be glad to know
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends

But I never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again
I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
