Uh huh, (it's a Showoff thing)
C-A, all day, (yeah), where the rain don't come down
(Hey Statik, this that shit right here)
We desperados, black guns and gold Movados
Chrome hollows, break bones or smash models
Never follow, get it by yourself, that's the motto
My heart's cold, feelin like winter in Colorado
Cali kush burnin, my brain's like a furnace
I was drivin in a Benz before I ever had a permit
See this is my Erick Sermon and I feel like I deserve it
I remember bein young, I used to spit my rhymes nervous
But now I'm on point like a javelin, way beyond battlin
Out of state travelin, haters stop babblin
Remember this, California's my residence
All my +People's Dilated+, just ask Evidence
I rep the coast everywhere I go
So even when I'm overseas, they know, they know, they know
I never front when it comes to the dough
I'm guaranteed to make a killing a show, they know, so let's go
I ride around with my tank on E
