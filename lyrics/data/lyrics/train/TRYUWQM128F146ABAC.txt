He is fierce and He is tender
He's our judge and our defender
And He calls us to surrender
For He loves us to the core
He is frightening and resplendent
He is present and transcendent
He's enmeshed and independent
And He cannot love us more

So He calls our names
And we fear Him for His goodness
For we know He won't be tamed
