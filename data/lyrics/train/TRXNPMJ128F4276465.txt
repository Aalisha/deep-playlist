Endicott's up by five o'clock
Endicott's givin' all he got
Endicott's job is six to nine but
Endicott's home by nine o'five
Endicott helps cook the steak
Endicott helps put the plates
Endicott puts the kids to bed
Endicott reads a book to them
Why can't you be like Endicott?
Endicott loves Tribena so
Endicott puts her on a pedestal
Endicott's wish is her command but
Endicott don't make no demands
Endicott's always back in time
Endicott's not the cheating kind
Endicott's full of compliment
Endicott's such a gentleman
Why can't you be like Endicott?
Cause I'm free
Free of made-to-order liabilities
Thank God I'm free
Cos it's hard enough for me
