Now, don't hold back now
Our time has come
To regroup
It's time to rise

We won't hold back
Get ready to brace yourself
We're coming back again

We all rise together
We're gonna bring them down

Raise your voices
The ground will shake and tremble
They will fear, they will fear, they will fear
Our shields and weapons
...
