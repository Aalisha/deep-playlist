Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
I never lost one minute of sleep
Worryin' about the way things might have been

Big wheels Keep on turnin
Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
And we're rollin'
Rollin, rollin on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
and I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city until I hitched
a ride on the river boat Queen
Big wheels Keep on turnin
