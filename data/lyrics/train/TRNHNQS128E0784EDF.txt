Oh yeah, ah ah ah
Is, ah, big dancehall song in know
Madzard alongside Kevin Lyttle
You know how it is
You know how we go
You know

For the longest while we jamming in the party
And you wining on me
Pushing everything up
Right back on top of me
(Tea hey ai)

But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you
Girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on

Let me jam you
Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on

The girl, ya nah go get way tonight
If she think mad man nah go fight
Me done feed her with popcorn and Sprite
Now she whar come fly way like kite

Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
