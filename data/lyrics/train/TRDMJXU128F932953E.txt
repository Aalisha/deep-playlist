whatever truth will reveal tomorrow, it's a lie
a cup of poison will always join us, for a while
and we'll laugh for a while
and we'll die, for a while
and then we'll blame us self for a wild routine
ground zero, we're back to one.

we can't combine

happy with the life they gave us, from day one
what disappears without a trace, reappears and we just approve
what we need, is a waist, solutions dissolves in our hands
we won't except that we understand
...
