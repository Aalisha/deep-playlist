"So you're thinkin' about tomorrow
and all those simple things you think you might like
but you've been sipping in the daylight, you see
well I've been trying to keep things light

So you're looking for approval
to do those stupid things your father might like
well you might kill youself to get it, you see
but it might never make things right
it just might leave you more uptight...

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
the novelties and memories
they save it for later you see,
they save it for later you see...

So now you're looking for some revelation
