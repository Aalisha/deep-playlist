Lets open up my eyes, tear the stitches out and pry inside.
Lets open up my heart, it's time to face the truth.
Lets open up my head and watch the horrors manifest themselves.
Lets open up, yeah, lets open up.

Lets open up our eyes, they've been closed off for so long.
Lets open up to the brightness, yeah, before the dark overcomes our hearts.
Lets open up this world, lets show our love and spread our wings.
Lets open up, yeah, lets open up.

Time heals the wounds that the wicked made
For me, and with every new day,
That time heals the wounds that the wicked made
For you, we'll grow stronger in every way.
