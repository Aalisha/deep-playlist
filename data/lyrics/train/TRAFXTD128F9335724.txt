Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright
And Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
