Don't be deprived of life
Start thinking consequence and meaning
Don't ever leave yourself
On this battleground of feelings
Try to prepare yourself
For a different way of thinking
We're going on a trip
That's leading to all ends

You'd better open your eyes
You drift away
From the truth you know
...
