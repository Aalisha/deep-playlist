Well you're not, you're not who you think you are
Well we think that you are John or Dave
But you're not, you're not who you think you are
Jumbled mass of preconceived ideas

From our birth we were given an identity
People told us we were great or small
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong
Not forgetting the bullies at school

The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits
