Battlement plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay...
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent?
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
so fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
(I'm so confused--take the world away)

I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
you in the land of stars when the block is enormous
squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
