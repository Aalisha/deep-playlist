I used to walk around like
nothing could happen to me
life is a gamble so i
should live life more carefully
but all i know is that i
control my own destiny
i used to look at others
instead of me blaming me

don't ask yourself why
just look to the sky
believe that soon you'll see the other side

i know
that through all the struggle
there's a bright road
at the end of the tunnel
now you should know
whatever your dilemma may be

You'll learn
life is worth it
watch the tables turn

yeah yeah yeah yeah

whenever you feel troubled
with problems coming your way
don't ever get discouraged
there's always a better day
we all don't know the answers
...
