Well I'd like to take you as I find you
Imagine our clothes are on the floor
Feel my caress so soft and gentle
So delicate you cry for more
But you know baby, You know baby does it right
And you know baby does it right.

Universe inside of your heart
You gotta let me know
So you can be free baby
You wanted it so much
And now that its over
You don't know what you want

Put time in a capsule
Two minds consensual
Entwined to perfection, If we could...
