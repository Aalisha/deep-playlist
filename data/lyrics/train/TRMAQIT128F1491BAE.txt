Verse 1:
Today they asked me, why do you always seem to fight?
But though I could not answer, I'd of lost my way.
I could tell that this ain't right
The morning sunrise seemed to ask me why I try?
To find the strength in people who had never thought about
A different way of life...
It just doesn't seem that easy

Chorus:
I don't know where to go, I don't know what to be

I don't know what do say, maybe another day
I'm stuck and I'm lost, can't find my way home
All I know is gone

Verse 2:
