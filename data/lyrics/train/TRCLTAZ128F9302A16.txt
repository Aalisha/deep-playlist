If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?

Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

If l could bottle up the chills that you gave me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
