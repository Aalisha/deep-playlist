Looking out my window
I can't help but think of you
Oooohhh
Since you've been gone away
I've been left feeling blue

No one can take
This pain away
My hours seem to turn to days
As if I'm out of time
No more to lose
No more to gain
It seems the clouds
Can't take the rain
Cause it keeps pouring down

But to see my sunshine again
(but to see my sunshine again)
But to see my sunshine again
(but to see my sunshine again)
But to see my sunshine again
(but to see my sunshine again)
But to see my sunshine again
But to see my sunshine again
(Again again)
