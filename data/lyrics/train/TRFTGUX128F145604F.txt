I've got to find an occupation, I've got to keep myself employed
It's a bad situation, my brain's destroyed
I've got to find a new vocation, I feel it burning down inside
Such a low down abrasion, inside it hurts my pride

I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day we will have won
I can feel it in my bones, this is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day thy will be done
I can feel it in my bones, this is the one

Got a bad situation, I can feel it building up inside
