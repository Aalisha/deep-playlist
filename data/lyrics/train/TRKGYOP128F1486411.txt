Come join our circus where we all wear masks
Lying while our fans are expected to last
Could it be that the jig is on us?
Masquerading like we are the one
Can you blame us?
It started as fun
Didn't know that the game must be won...
Sorry

Never did I lie; never did I need a trick yall
But they told me this how they get rich yall
Make a hit song, same lame lyrics, same bass, same kickdrum
Buy the record you became a big big victim
Bitch can't front, get what I want, neck, hands and my wrist numb
Sick none, diamonds on my wristband
Who I'm talking to? You, you and my biggest fan
Thinking that ya girl got it all, and I got the best man, best hair, best legs
Need a break, you in my face, asking K, what I'm putting out next year
Is it gonna be real freaky, critics wanna come critique me
Are you gonna be more grunge, rock and roll like back when you dropped before
But get back, before I get ill
Black love, black mask, listen to some real black love
That's all I have, that's all I have
...
