Sometimes I feel so lost SOS.
All my lines are crossed.
I bite off more than I can chew.
It's killing me its killing you there's nothing that I'd rather do.
It's got me now its holding me.
A sign of something good a sign I thought I'd never see.
I try to keep it in my head.
We'll you can kick my ass and burn your books, but it won't change a word I've said.
I guess I should have seen it coming.
It's in the smile on his face.
