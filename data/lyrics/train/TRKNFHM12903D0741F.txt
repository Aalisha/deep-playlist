I never cared too much, acquired mental health
I let my reputation speak just for itself

I never liked the rules that came 'long with the game
Take me back where the whisper knows my name

Ready to fly; and I'm ready to die
Scare the angel, fly away
Let the devil have his way
Tie your tongue into a knot
Pray to God it never stops
Ready to fly; and I'm ready to die
Fuel me up, let me go
Shut your mouth, going to blow
Hold your ears and shield your eyes
Just a word to the wise

Bring me the night
