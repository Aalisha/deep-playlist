Life is like a sinking ship
And you are at the wheel
I see the hull, it's filling up
You know your fate is sealed

Still you keep on trying
To steer the ship to shore
It's time to learn the lesson
You have known before

Well there's nothing you can do
And we don't believe you
No there's nothing you can ever do
...
