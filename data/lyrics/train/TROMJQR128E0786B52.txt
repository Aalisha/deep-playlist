I'm not so young anymore
And I'm not so dumb anymore
If you've seen what I've seen
Then you'd understand what I mean

And don't stell me that you think I'm really hot
If you want me for your girlfriend

Action speaks louder than words
Let's see what you can do
See if you are coming through
Before I'm giving in to attraction
I gotta check out the action

And if you can't deliver the time
