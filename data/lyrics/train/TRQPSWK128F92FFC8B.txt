This place is crowded
Don't know about you
I need some sex
Some sex with you
Cause your on my mind
I can feel your sweat
your body's wet
and I need some help
Girl you know what we need to do
Girl, let's take a walk
(walk)
outside
(walk outside)
let's take a walk
(walk)
outside
(walk outside)
let's take a walk
(walk)
outside
(walk outside)

I'm ready to go
go grab your coat
it's hard to hold
I'm ready to let go
