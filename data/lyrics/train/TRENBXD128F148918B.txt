And so I wrote this song for you
I think I know just what you're going through
Did you believe you'd never change
Nothin ever stays the same

I know it's hard holdin on
Even harder trying to let it go
And so you're frozen like a stone
But you are not alone

Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving in to love, love
...
