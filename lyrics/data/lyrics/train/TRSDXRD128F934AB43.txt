Bedroom mirrors do tell who's the fairest
of them all
Lime light silhouette transparent attic walls
Dancing shadows cascade paper walls
Wailing ghost guitars send in the clowns

Painted plastic faces stealing mommies
make up
Masque the false gods with mannequin smiles
Prima donnas play upon their pedestal
of fame
Unborn girls false fascade illegitamate child
I won't play your game
...
