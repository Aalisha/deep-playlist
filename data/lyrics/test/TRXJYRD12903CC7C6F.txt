I JUST WANT TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE

Baby, remember what they told you never...
It's scary to realize you're not a member of the human race,
but you're still running anyway.
Retard canard trying to fly far from home.
It's scary to realize you're always alone,
but you're still flying anyway.

I don't wanna start a flame in your heart,
I just wanna set the world on fire.
