YOU OUGHT TO BE WITH ME
Al Green
(A. Green, W. Mitchell, A. Jackson)

Sit right down and talk to me,
about how you want to be,
you ought to be with me,
ya, you ought to be with me.

Thinking about what people do,
talking about how I love you,
thinking there's nothing to what they say,
you ought to be with me, anyway.
