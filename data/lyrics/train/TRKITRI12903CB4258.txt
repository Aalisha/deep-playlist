In The Shadows Of The Graveyards

Birthed From The Burning Womb
From The Dead Seas A Leader Is Born
The Birds Fall Dead From The Skies
Unholy Son Shall Rise

Let Me Roam In The Shadows Of The Graveyard
I Cruch The Wings Of Angels Beneath My Feet
Candlelight Dances Through The Darkness
Angels Aflame Scream To The Midnight Skies
In The Shadows Of The Graveyard

The Tongue Of The Serpent... Ablaze
Destroying All The Holy
Maggots Seek The Light Of God
Descending Angels Aflame
