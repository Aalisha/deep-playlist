In the darkness, I keep you warm
In the coldest winter, I take you in my arms
I feel your warm skin and I smell your breath
Before the dawn is coming up, I love you to death

In the darkness, I'm with you
Hold me now, hold me now
In the darkness, our world is painted blue
In deep dark colors, I love you
