Your stuck on a chain
And your toeing a lie
Seems like every time that you catch up
You only fall behind

And your trapped inside this world you made yourself
but that's not the world I live in
this is not the life for me
cause my world is bigger than your problems
and it's bigger than me
that's not the world I live in
this is not the life for me
cause my world is bigger than your problems
and it's bigger than me
