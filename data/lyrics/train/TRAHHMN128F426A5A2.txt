Crawling from the cities the filth chokes me to the taste,
feeding the desire to destroy this culture that I hate,
the daily inquisition, the fear that fuels our lives,
sets each man against the other with the wool upon our eyes.

Chains of common
the weight of wait
under their wheels into concrete
face off the floor
...
