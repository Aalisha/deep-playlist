Mary Jayne, I'm gettin' so fed up with all the shit
That everyone keeps handing me
Mary Jayne, whisper in my ears
'Cause you're the one that truly understands me
Mary Jayne, you know you build me up
And I just beg you girl to never leave me

I wanna hear ya scream my name, Mary Jayne
Oh, you get me fucked up, get me fucked up inside my brain
Scream my name, Mary Jayne
Oh, you get me so high, get me so high, I can't, I know I can't

Baby, baby, won't you just sit back
...
