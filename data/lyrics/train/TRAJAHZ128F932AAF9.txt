Knick Kn채ck - there goes my heart - smashed on the floor
Ripped out by your cold hand
Knick Kn채ck - there goes my brain - cracked on the wall
Destroyed by your dark mind
Knick Kn채ck - there goes my spine - broken apart
While I was still on my knees
Knick Kn채ck - there goes my trust - kicked away
While I was still on my knees
