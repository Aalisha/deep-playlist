Why do I care?
Is what you said to me
That question is haunting me
It's time you find out why

Do you enjoy watching me fall?
Hearing my bones break as I hit the ground
Do you like it when my blood runs cold?
Turning your face to a memory

Broken down inside of me
You've said too much
It doesn't matter anymore
I laid my dreams beneath your feet
So please tread softly
For you tread on my dreams

Do you enjoy watching me fall?
