Anger seeds sown once in not buried past
Hatred grows
With the thoughts of a liberation
See my eyes and you shall see
They're deeper than the blackest sea
Emancipation - serenity to be received

Release me

My mind all serene
My consciousness relieved
This is the only confession that I need

Enemies of mine
You shall be condemned
Imprisoned spirit of hate
Released when you're dead
Dare me now
I'll feel relief when you're dead
Satisfaction, retribution
...
