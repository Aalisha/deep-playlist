Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance, he wants to dance
He loves to dance, he's got to dance
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance
No, no, no
Oh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

The minute the band begins to swing it
He's on his feet to dig it and dance the night away
Stop, I'm spinnin' like a top
We'll dance until we drop, but if I have my way
