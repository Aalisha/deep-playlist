Sometimes on (out)my window
I notice that you've been cryin' over him
And I wonder why you just don't
Kick him to the curb instead of bein' with him

You see love at first is summer time
That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks it's gonna end

But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again

But you should know
When it gets too cold
You're not alone
I'll melt the snow

Some nights I can hear you
Screamin' on the phone over somethin' that he did
And I wonder what can I do
