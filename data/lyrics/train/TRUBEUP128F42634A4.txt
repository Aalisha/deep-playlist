I looked in the mirror today
Took a good long look at my face
And all I guess that I can say
Is I'm just a man trying to find his way

It's been a long and windy road
But at least I got you to hold
And I've become the man I am
'Cause all our troubles made me understand
It's been all of our lives

All of our lives I wanna stay this way
Our Lord knows we're gonna make mistakes
But I'll give up everything to make it through
And all of our lives ain't been the easiest time
And Lord knows it's been an up hill climb
I'll do it all again to be with you

Ever since we went through with the plan
I'm feeling like I've become a better man
