Gerry Goffin / Carole King)

You gotta give me some
Give me some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some of your lovin'

Now I'm not a greedy girl
I don't need the world
(Just give me some)
Some of your lovin' now, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby when I need you
Don't you tell me no

You gotta give me some
...
