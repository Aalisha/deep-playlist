Kardinal Offishall
Not 4 Sale
Due Me A Favour feat. Estelle

{intro}
Woah
Oh x 5
{verse 1}

Yo
It's like speeding down the highway
With a blind fold on
No hands on the wheel
Hopin' God will lead me my way
And I know he real
So my grandma say what I
Feel a sweat from the sun
Cause I work construction
I gotta take care of my son
I got one in the oven on the way
Rents late, two months
Cause my land lord talks too much

Hands full of calises
And I still got the magic touch to make wifee blush
I been workin' it out since a high school crush
Foots on the clutch
Minds on my money
But my money ain't there
But I will not resort to welfare I care
Can't stop
Won't stop
Couldn't even do it if I tried
If I said I did I'd lie
Let's ride x 2
Ride...

{chorus}
I need a favour tonight
More than heaven knows
I need a favour tonight... x 2
Could God do me a favour?
I could really use a favour
Can I get it tonight?
(repeat once more)

{verse 2}
No
Christmas here
I'm taking time and a half
Gotta make that cash
Even if a nigga gotta drive that cab
I'm gonna treat it like a limo
Didn't know? y'better ask
Somebody told me
Closed mouths don't eat
Closed eyes may never ever see
So I try with everything I've got to not sleep
