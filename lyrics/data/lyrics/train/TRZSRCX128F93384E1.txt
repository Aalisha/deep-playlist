Place these fingers over the holes in your flesh
But you'll never find the pieces that you lack

Searching nameless city streets and abandoned hearts
For your salvation
Nothing will save you here
Borrowed time, forgotten miles, faceless tragedy
This lost city's demise

We'll be the ones to break this mold
You've spent way too long to get this wrong
Your perception and your walls between everything
...
