They danced like sirens,
Hoping the sun would come out again,
And I was born in the fog of that day,
Could they hear a babe, under all that faith,
Or have they forgot what it was they made?

Found a log and floated away,
Didn't think I'd be coming back this way.
But my feet resolute, found their root,
And brought me back to its place.
