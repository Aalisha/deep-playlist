Last night you came home late
You tried to tiptoe in
I sat here for hours
Wondering where you've been

You ran into an old friend
And you just lost track of time
When you told me that there was something
About the twinkle in your eye

So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal

It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
For the long run
