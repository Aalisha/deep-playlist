(J.J. Cale)

Heard the one about your woman
Lord, she's been messing 'round
She's been stepping out on the street
Lord, she's been hanging out
Ain't nobody had her this week but it won't take long

Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
And I hope it won't mess with me
