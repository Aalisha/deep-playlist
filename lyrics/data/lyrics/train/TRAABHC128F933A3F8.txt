Outside watching as the day slowly fades away
Hoping that you'll stay right here beside me
Wrapped around me
The pink galahs are sitting in the trees
In the summer breeze just like you and me
They found each other
And wn't find another

Underneath two different skies
Is where we fall too many times
Just close your eyes and they'll collide
