In The Dark...
(repeat)
In The Dark...
In The Dark...
In The Dark...

How can I say what's on my mind
I'll try to find the works this time
I don't wanna be there alone
Cause you make my house a happy home
Loving you is what I need
baby just to make my life complete
you're the one that sees my heart
