Why don't you stop
And look me over?
Am I the same girl
You used to know?

Why don't you stop
And think it over?
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so?

I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet

Around the corner everyday
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
