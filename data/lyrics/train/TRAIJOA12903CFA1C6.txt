It has been many years since I was thrown into the cell
My sentence was electrocution when the gavel fell
The clock is slowly getting closer to that final time
Strapped into the chair and punished for false crimes

My last meal is getting colder
But I have no appetite
I look down the hall at the impending doom
That waits for me this very night
My last rites are read by the pastor
As if I had rights from the start
I'm moments away before they strap me in
And voltage will flow through my heart

The warden straps me in
Flashes me a twisted grin
No last words for me to say
...
