The way she sees me
She's always leads me
Thru the night
She's out to tease me
With a glance
I take a chance
From the start
I'm in a trance
It's time you're mine
She's just taken you for a ride
You're alone
Out on your own
And then you know
Know she lied

Chorus 1:
Some other deal
Some other way
I hate to say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
Some other deal
Some other way
All I can say
Don't you know
Love's a bitch
(Love's a bitch)

The road to a mountain
...
