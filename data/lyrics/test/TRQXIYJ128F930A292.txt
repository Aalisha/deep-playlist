You know a man likes a good time
He likes to wine and then dine
A beautiful woman
And love her through the night
And if the lovin' feels right
He likes to do her two times
Pleasing that woman
Until she's satisfied
But when all the love is done
Who wants love that's on the run?
One good time, but there's so much more
How 'bout conversation, some communication
Someone who loves you and stimulates your mind, baby

A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a woman
I need the kinda girl who keeps on
Usin' her mind all of the time, baby
A pretty little girl just ain't gonna get it
I need a good strong woman, who'll keep love comin'
All of the time, all of her life

You know a man likes to have fun
He likes to get into some tender young roni's
As pretty as they come
He likes to love all night long
