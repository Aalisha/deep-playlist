I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you, I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh, huh

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you, is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that alright? I drove all night
