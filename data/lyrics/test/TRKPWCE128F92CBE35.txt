I'm getting myself in something I don't wanna
I'm getting caught up in him but I don't wanna
I'm getting off track and I can't control a thing, a thing
I'm telling myself it's not a good idea
But the more I hesitate the more I fall for him
I'm tryin' to erase his face from my memory
And then a boom shalaka, he's walkin' up to me
Boom shalaka, he starts to talk to me
Boom shalaka, my heart skips
Boom shalaka laka, boom, boom
The more I hang there the more I get wrapped up in him
Imagine myself in the chair I was sittin' in
And every little thing he said comin' back to me, to me
The more I get scared of losin' I'm afraid to say
