Things aren't quite as they seem

Inside my domain

You can't know about everything
Only pleasure and pain

You wonder why I come here

With head to my hands

Where else can I be cured
And the king of your mansion
A thorn in your side

A child to protect
That claims he's free

Just around the corner
