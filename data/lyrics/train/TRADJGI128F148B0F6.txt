She said hey hello there
As her eyes were dancing all around me
She told me her name sweetly
It felt like I knew her like I never knew someone before
Well I found her now I can stop holding my breath
I tell all my friends over and over again

I said there ain't no woman likke the one I got
Yes I know, Yes I know
I said there ain't no woman like the one I got
Yes I know, yes I know

Whatever you need just tell me
...
