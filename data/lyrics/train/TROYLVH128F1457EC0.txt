A little bit of soap will wash
Away the lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will wash
Away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
