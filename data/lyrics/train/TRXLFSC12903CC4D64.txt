She said: "He so sweet

I wanna lick the wrapper."
And she, she licked me
Like a lollipop...

Like a lollipop
Shorty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch

Ya lovely lady lumps
Shorty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shorty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Ya lovely lady lumps
Cute lil' mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair
Down her back like mine

I make her feel right
When it's wrong like lyin'

Man she ain't never
...
