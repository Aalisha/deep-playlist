There's a lake that is locked
And frozen
Something has been there
For at least three thousand years
There is a room that is locked
And haunted
Something's been inside
trying to survive.
I've seen traps
Rusting in the street
I've found lions in my bath
And prowling the ravines
I've seen ghosts rising
From the snow
And there's still so much
That I don't know.

Chorus:
I've seen things that
I dare not explain
But I tell you I'm fine
...
