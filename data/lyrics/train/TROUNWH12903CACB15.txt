"Meier may we be this way forever,
And tell me lover,
What will become of the others?"

Bones, skin, nails, and flesh.
On a bed of lack of passion.
A medieval consequence.
They worry you with all the talk of how you're not their kind.

Now I'm stealing her body
And taking it home.
There is always one more fall.

Maladjusted you must trust me darling.
Subsequently, you see, you deserve more than me.
They bury you while wearing garments
Of funeral fire.
