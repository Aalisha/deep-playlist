Draw your blade and strike -
For in this war all are forced to choose a side.
None will the truth discerned;
Our heroes fall yet we only keep marching.
Seek out your foe and leave them dead in their sleep.
Show them no mercy; they have not the right of transformation.
And if you stray too far from
The path you'll be counted among the dead.
Ashes.
For we consider them dead
...
