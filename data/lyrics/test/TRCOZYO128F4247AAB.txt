I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
Hey, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
And I love the feeling

The sun seems to shine all the time in my mind
Since I met you, baby
All my cares and all my fears are far behind

Hey, I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling
I tell you I'm in love
Ooh and I love the feeling

I've got a song in my heart, just one look, that's all it took
I was hooked from the very start
And the feeling's wonderful, marvelous, heavenly
