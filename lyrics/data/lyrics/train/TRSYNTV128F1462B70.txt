The air my lungs first loved carves craters from my eyes
They said "Breathe deeply son, or be the next to die"

Beneath the falling night
And heaven's shutting gate
Pray keep your tongue held tight
Or suffer the same fate

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn
...
