No one can take the place of you
Nobody in the world touches me like you do
And I know, yes I know, you're untouchable

No one knows me like you do
Nobody comprehends the pain I'm going through, except you
But I know you're untouchable
I accept you're untouchable

You never wanted
what I always needed
And I always needed a door
