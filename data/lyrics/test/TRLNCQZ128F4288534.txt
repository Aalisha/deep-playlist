I know that it's over but I still reminisce
'Bout the very first time that I saw you
And the first time that we kissed
I still recall the days of good old love we made
Without taking off our clothes
you spoke a language to my body baby
So universal, you and me talking baby

Ooh ahhh, oh my, ooh la la la la
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
Speaking in tongues babe with you
