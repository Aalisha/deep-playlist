You're in my head tormenting me
I'm running scared in my time of need
Cuts on my head, cuts on my feet
I'm here waiting so baptize me, hey
Baptize me

I need a reason, I need to know just why
You were my meaning now its me you deny
You're in my head tormenting me
I'm here waiting so baptize me, hey
Baptize me, hey, baptize me
