I've got a friend, her name is Laura
We took a holiday, seven sweet days in Majorca
We took a plane through the southern Spain
To see the ocean waves blue
We sat and watched the moon as crickets sang back cover tunes
Way back in May

Seven days in the sun, yeah

She's my heaven
She's a spark yeah yeah
Feels like heaven
So light me up

She's got this friend, whose name is Paula
He likes to cross dress every Friday night
In clothes from Prada
We took a train left behind the rain
To see the summer sunset glow
