If I flew into a mountain
Burn myself to nothing
There would be something
Would it be enough?
A pistol to my temple
Pull the trigger like its nothing
There would be something, but it's never enough

This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough

I hurt someone that loved you
