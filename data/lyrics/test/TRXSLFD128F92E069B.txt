Shootin' Stars. Gilded Age
Yeah just spill your dreams to me
And we just hide away
you can stay if you believe
Just a leap of faith
Across a busy Boulevard of Broken Dreams

And I dream about her even though I never should...
Miss Hollywood, miss Hollywood, miss Hollywood

Yea I would ride into the sunset if I could
Ms. Hollywood, Ms. Hollywood, Ms. Hollywood
So slow to fade...
