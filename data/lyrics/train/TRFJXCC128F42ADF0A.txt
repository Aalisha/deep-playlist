(Verse 1)

Remember wanting me so much
i used to tingle from ur touch
and i'd wait for you to come home
ur sittin right beside the phone
and there was nothing else but you
and who could seperate us to
i'd never know when we got lost
but now im counting up the calls

(Chorus)

i wish we could go back (to love less complicated) i
i wish we could go back (ready to prove our love when they said we couldnt make it no)
Please tell me u miss that (that new love, crazy love)
cuz i wanna go back i know its possible
tell me you feel it to

What i wouldnt do to rekindle our romance
o what i wouldnt do not many get a second chance oh no
