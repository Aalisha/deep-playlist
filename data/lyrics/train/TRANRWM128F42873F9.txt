Dance with me below crystal knives
Chandeliers ablaze
We'll dance in fear of our own lives
That our eyes contain
Behind these masks we renegade against the sound
We'll let our voices slowly fade and ring out

Crystal chandeliers hang
Crystal chandeliers hang
Gently swaying with our bodies, fall down
...
