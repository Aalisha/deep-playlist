Got you working the nine to five
Well every day it's all you can do just to stay alive
Wasting your time away
There's got to be a better way

 (Living life in the real world)
Well it's an uphill climb
(Living life in the real world)
Time after time, they knock you down
You gotta get up, you gotta live your life in the real world

With every second it slips away
It's gettin' harder to see
