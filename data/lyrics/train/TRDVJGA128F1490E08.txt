Love is tragic
Love is bold
You will always
Do what you are told

Love is hard
Love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong
I don't know when I got bitter
Love is surely better when it's gone

'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

Love is colour
