Well, I've got two lovers,
and I ain't ashamed.
Two lovers, and I love them both the same.

Let me tell you bout, my first lover.
He's sweet and kind, and he's mine, oh, mine, and
Treats me good like a lover should.
And makes me love him.
I really really love him oh, oh, I love him so.
And I'll do everything I can to let him know.
