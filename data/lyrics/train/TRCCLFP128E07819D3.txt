Don't drink me I'm like turpentine
Make you blind, burn your insides
If I don't know me then I don't know you
Can't figure out what I'm supposed to do

I ain't running away from my mind this time
I ain't running away from my mind this time

There's a killer in me and a killer in you
A little talent but a lot would do
