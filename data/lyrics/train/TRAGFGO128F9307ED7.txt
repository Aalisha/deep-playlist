Going with a stranger is a dangerous thing
for a pretty little girl of sixteen years like you
So keep your eyes open when they buy you a drink,
'cause drinking with a stranger is a dangerous thing

This town is full of young girls who didn't see the danger
of going with a stranger in the night
They lost their virginity from fear of being killed
...
