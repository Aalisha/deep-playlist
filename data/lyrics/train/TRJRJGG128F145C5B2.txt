Days we drive around
With Siamese rainin' down
And there's angels shooting stars
And there's angels shooting stars

Cool summers pourin' down
Washin' green across the town
And we follow long its trail

We run around and trace the ground
Falling back to catch the lands
As they fumble through our hands

We feel alive in the move from Sundays
Singin' loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
Feel alive in the move from Sundays
Sing and shout, sing and shout

It's rainin' hard like the years between us
Leavin' silent space around us
Formin' walls like they're meant to part
They're rainin' down, they're rainin' down
...
