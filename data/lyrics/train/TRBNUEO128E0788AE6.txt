well you could do better than to treat me like you do
you could do better to remember who you're talking to
yeah I'm the one you held first
yeah I'm the one I'm the one you held first

well you could do better than to make me insecure
you could do better just make me feel sure
that I'm the one, yeah I'm the one you call first
yeah I'm the one, am the one you call first

well listen to me babe I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
