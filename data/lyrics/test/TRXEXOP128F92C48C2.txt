Another day, another town
The window rolled down I got the wind blowing on my face
Well every twist every turn another lesson learned
In this thing we call the human race

An adventure is waiting let’s set out and discover it

We’re on this road together leaving the past in a cloud of smoke
Headed on to forever as we follow the One who knows this road
