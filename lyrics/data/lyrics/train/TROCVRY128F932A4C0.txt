Oh, well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em, 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around

Oh, well, there's Flo on my left arm, and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl, well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt, and I show her "Rosie" on my chest
'Cause I'm a wanderer, yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, um
