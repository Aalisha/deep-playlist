Be wary - of what you see
Be wary - of evil schemes
Be wary of those in the temple courts
With their hands lifted high
Blood flowing from their palms
An offering of demonic psalms
Their prayer doused in death
Beckoning praise from the earth
A false witness who pours out lies
And hands that she'd innocent blood
Wondrous signs, holy sights, prophesy
In the name of heaven
