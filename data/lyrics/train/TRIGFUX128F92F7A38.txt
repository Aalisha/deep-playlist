All that time alone,
Made me go insane.
Wasn't hard to see,
I had lost control.
Then you came away,
Still I don't know how,
And your right there with your smile.
I can read your eyes,
When you look at me,
Had me tied to you.
Wanna feel your love tonight.
Gonna leave the past behind.
Holding on to pain,
Made it hard to breathe.
Couldn't get away,
From my memories.
