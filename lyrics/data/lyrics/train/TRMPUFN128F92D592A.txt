You don't know how much I hate you
And always will
I'll never crawl before your thrones
You don't know the day will come soon
When we will kill
The final holocaust for your dark hearts

Feels like I'm on poisoned adrenaline
Aggro-toxic amphetamine
This one goes out to the ones I hate
Poisoned adrenaline
Socio terror on endorphins
...
