The one good thing in my life
Has gone away
I don't know why
She's gone away
I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long
Woo who who who
My back was turned and she was gone
Hey hey hey

Good thing
Where have you gone
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo

People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow
Don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
...
