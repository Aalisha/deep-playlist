Took a look to the future
Thought I could see love slippin' away-ay-ay
And I just couldn't take it
But I never forget you
I couldn't get by ano-other day-ay-ay
And I just wouldn't make it

Could I tell ya how much I need you
How ever far away, yeah-eah
Could I tell ya how much I miss you
So mu-uch more than words can say

I love you more than words
Can say-ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

Took a look in my mirror
Thought I could see love fading away-ay-ay
...
