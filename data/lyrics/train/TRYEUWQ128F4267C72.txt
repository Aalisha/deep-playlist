I ain't gonna call Hank Williams Junior, junior anymore
Even though I know what all his daddy done before
Hank weighs close to two hundred pounds
And he stands about six foot four
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Junior, junior anymore

Just a little bit of Waylon sure goes a long way
But old Tex Ritter rode his horse and that was hell to pay
Willie said don't nobody lay a hand on the bay
Jimmie Rodgers is the only reason that I'm standin' here today
