i wanna be somewhere where i know that i'm gonna do something
i wanna get somewhere and i know that i've gotta decide
if i can leave somewhere where i know i might never do nothing
i've never been so scared and i know i might run out of time
I wanna be somewhere where i know that i'm gonna do something
(I wanna be somewhere where i know that i'm gonna do something)
i wanna get somewhere and i know that i've gotta decide
(i wanna get somewhere and i know that i've gotta decide)
