She says, "I've got something to say"
She knows, that what she says will change everything
She's laid, through too many sleepless nights
She's cryin', she's cryin', she's cryin'

Brother, don't ever let him do this again
This time it's over I'm gonna make it end

Now it's over and the old man is dead
Lyin' on the ground, bullet in his head
