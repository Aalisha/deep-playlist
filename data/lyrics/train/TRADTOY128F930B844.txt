Uh, it's hard catchin' these old rhymes
I cant' remember these old rhymes
It's hard catchin' these old rhymes

Shit we comin' after the Whack Rappers
Studio Gat-Clappers, Slash Jackers
Them braggin' back-stabbin' non-rappin' autographers
And I'm backed up like brake lights don't beep me
That's some shit you ain't gon' see like a punch in a snake fight
Or a preacher that play dice it's another level bitch
And I'm sick of rappers braggin' bout they diamond bezelled wrists
My ice this, my ice that, I bet I'll melt yo shit
'Cause Shawn J come hotter than the devil's dick

Couldn't beat me if I was yo dick
We were in the movies watchin' porn flicks in 3D and you were peewee
I don't blow shit out of proportion I'll stuff you in yo mama's stomach
Rap her then make her have an abortion
The Vince carter of rap, Shawn tall and brown skinned
Dunkin' dick in yo bitch with my arm in the rim
Keep yo hoe I chase dough burnin' rappers till sun-up
And jackin' off layin' on my back tryin' to come up

To get grip Shawn Slick with bricks for chips
I flip one-fifth of a brick nicks go for 6
Tug a four-fifth with more glits than 6 twists
I don't sniff but I spit Catch a whiff nit-wit
Slick 6 style switch like a whip stick shift
I stole rap like the Grinch stole Christmas
My clique pissed tryin' to hit licks to get grip
Tryin' to make more bread thanquickcuits
