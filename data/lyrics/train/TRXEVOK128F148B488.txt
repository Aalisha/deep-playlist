(chorus)
Love see us through
Because of you
I know we're strong enough
Love see us through
Through and through
This love is strong enough for two

I believe in all that love can bring
Ha, I can see it's meant to be
And we'll be together

(together)
see the best in me
(forever)
We were meant to be
'Cause I know it
